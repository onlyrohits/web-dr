{"text": "it might be more than strep if you have had it more than 7 days after you started meds I would go get tested for mono No I was not on the pillI have not been on birth control for 2 years Sometimes it can be an indication of a problem but at 37 weeks youre OB would tell you if he thought you needed to schedule an early csection When a person has a blood sugar level of 400 mgdl its no jokeThe human body goes into a protective mode and attempts to remove the excess sugar through the urine This can lead to an extreme state of dehydration and may cause seizures being placed in a coma state and even death A second condition seen in patients with blood sugar levels in the 400 mgdl range is the hyperglycemic buildup of ketone acids in the blood This causes individuals to become sleepy become mentally confused have trouble breathing and again may even result in death Having a chronic blood sugar level in the 400 mgdl may result in eye disease even blindness kidney disease and amputations It will almost certainly shorten the quality of your life and probably shorten your life expectancy How serious is a 400 mgdl glucose result As you can see by the potential negative consequences listed by me It is a grave matter and it couldnt be much more serious  BMP stands for Basic Metabolic Profile It provides a meaningful snapshot of eight 8 different blood studies They are tested to give your health care provider important information about the current status of your kidneys as well as electrolyte and acid  base balance and level of blood glucose The following tests are part of the BMP Serum blood testing ranges are not set in stone The inrange value for any given blood study can vary from lab to lab Was the test performed as part of routine blood work or did you present with abnormal liver symptoms Are you jaundice Bilirubin levels that are high may indicate excessive destruction of red blood cells This symptom may appear with cirrhosis of the liver but may also be high with anemia gallstones hepatitis and other disorders It seems like a reasonable plan to talk with the doctor who ordered the test Write down all medications that you are taking including over the counter products list all presenting medical symptoms and prepare bulletpoint questions to be asked of the doctor during your next meeting Perhaps the physician can reorder the test to substantiate the original results With additional studies a physical examination and by interviewing you to determine if other liver disorder symptoms exist a definitive diagnosis may be determined Unless an unlikely error occured during the analysis of your testing the results should be accepted as being validIn addition your doctor seems to feel that your results were accurate It is probably in your best interest to accept the results as being postive for just chlamydia If you have unexplained symptoms relating to a sexually transmitted disease it is best to contact your doctor and to be retested In the meantime please be careful and stay well Your 83 result falls into the normal range The normal range is 60 gdl83dl Notes 1Normal values may vary from one testing lab to another 2 The doctor that requested the test is in the best position to interrupt the results based upon knowing you as their patient Some additional information that you may find helpful includes the following factsThe Total Protein Serum Test may help to identify nutritional kidney or liver irregularities Although your result was on the high end of the range it would be considered to be normal I do not know your concern over this specific test result but want to answer your question completely Therefore just as a matter of information sometimes an elevated level may be caused by pregnancy or interaction of certain medications taken by the patient A higher than normal Total Protein Serum Test could also indicate a chronic inflammation or infection  No a lipid panel is a blood test specific to analyzing the amount of cholesterol and fats called triglycerides A WBC white blood count is ordered by a physician as part of a CBC complete blood count to screen for a wide range of diseases and conditions such as to diagnose an infection It also may be used to determine the presence of other diseases that affect WBCs such as leukemia or immune disorders I am sorry for your daughters illness I know that it is a scary time for you and your family The waiting period is the worst and should end soon It sounds like she may have Hepatitis A Hepatitis A is primarily contracted by eating or drinking contaminated food or beverages containing the Hepatitis A virus The news is essentially positive in that treatment usually consists of 3 months or so of bed rest with most people making a full recovery within 6 months It also seems that the doctors are appropriately covering all bases by asking a surgeon to review the MRI results Yes the viewing of some undistinguishable object next to the liver is worrisome but it could end up being a benign and nonissue At this time it is difficult not knowing the complete results of the MRI for your precious daughter Based upon her young age having a supportive mother and doctors that are investigating all possibilities Im rooting for and predicting a positive outcome A phobia may be defined as a persistent irrational fear of a specific object activity or situation that leads to a compelling desire to avoid it I dont know how old you are as some phobias will just disappear over time Although the fear may seem very irrational to many of us Im sure that it is perceived as very real to you Dont allow well intentioned people to tell you just get over it Additionally you must move forward to overcome this fear for you and not for other people Like most phobias they can be overcome with the therapeutic help of a professional and hard work on your part The following are some suggestions have your blood drawn in the company of a loyal friend or family member to receive necessary emotional support visit with a trained psychologist who will work on you at your own pace with the goal of acclimating you mentally for the procedure Hypnosis therapy can also be helpful with difficult cases Investigate some of the clinical laboratories in your area and research for the most competent technician to draw your blood All labs and their technicians do not possess equal skills My experience has shown me that the largest and busiest labs usually do the best blood draws This is because it is all that they do on their job for every day of their working week They take blood from heavy folks think folks the very young the old and the very frail and very ill It stands to reason that they become superlike specialist at their task Tell the lab about your fears and ask for their recommendations They may assign you to their best lab worker with the best blood drawing skills and patient demeanor Sometimes using a blood draw setup designed for babies and children is also beneficial These kits have smaller gauge needles and can make the difference between a painful arm stick and a barely feel it stick Your victory over this fear will most likely be won in small doses of success Remember a long voyage begins with the first step SGPT is an abbreviation for a serum blood test of an enzyme produced in the liver and in the heart SGPT enzymes are released into the blood stream when damage to the heart or liver occur Elevated SGPT levels are thus observed with heart and liver abnormalities Sometimes various medications will also increase the SGPT levels SGPT is an abbreviation for a serum blood test of an enzyme produced in the liver and in the heart SGPT enzymes are released into the blood stream when damage to the heart or liver occur Elevated SGPT levels are thus observed with heart and liver abnormalities Sometimes various medications will also increase the SGPT levels The 143 sodium level for a 64 year old woman would fall into the normal range Normal sodium levels can vary from one laboratory to another A sodium level falling between the range of 136145 would be considered normal  Without knowing you or your doctor its not possible to know what blood work was performed With that said it is a safe bet that your recent blood work included a test for diabetes Many physicians will order a CMP or Comprehensive Metabolic Panel as part of the blood work studies for their patients The CMP includes measuring the Serum Glucose Level of the blood These levels can determine diabetes or hypoglycemia Depending on the lab and your health insurance carrier you may be able to obtain a copy of tests results online without waiting for your doctor to return from vacation Under the Federal HIPAA Regulations a patient is entitled to receive a copy of their medical records High blood serum protein is just one study with your sons result being higher than the normal range Other diagnostic testing medical history and recent lifestyle factors must be considered in order to determine the full meaning of the testing results High protein in the blood may be seen even in mild cases of dehydration Yes there can also be serious causes for higher than normal protein in the blood and may include some forms of cancer HIVAIDS and bone marrow irregularities Without other prominent symptoms Id suspect that some fluid depletion of the body is responsible for the higher than normal protein in the blood value I hope that your physician determines the cause quickly to alleviate your understandable concern  RDW is a medical abbreviation that stands for Red Blood Cell Distribution Width It is a measurement of the size of red blood cells RDW is routinely tested for during a Complete Blood Count CBC A normal RDW range for adults is 102  146 Expect normal RDW to vary from testing lab to testing lab Low values can suggest anemia while high values are sometimes seen in liver disease and vitamin B 12 deficiency cases An interesting fact about higher than normal RDW results is that it is a strong predictor of early death  Yes a TIA Transient Ischemic Attack also known as a ministroke may cause some permanent damage According to some recent studies 15 of individuals experiencing a TIA had some result disability occurring within 90days of the episode Disability in this case is defined as some routine daily activity that was able to be accomplished before the TIA but is now unable to be performed Based upon your description of the evaluations occurring after your TIA it is a safe bet that to reason you sustained a cognitive disability and some degree of neurologic damage Perhaps your neurologist will consider or already is treating you with a blood thinner to provide protection against blood clots and future TIAs or even a major stroke Yes a TIA Transient Ischemic Attack also known as a ministroke may cause some permanent damage According to some recent

a major stroke I just realized that I did not completely answer your question But sometimes a low result shows with Hepatitis C malnutrition or a magnesium deficiency  Absolute Neutrophil Count is a measurement of the percentage of the total White Blood Cells that are devoted to fighting infection Normal values may vary from testing lab to testing lab but should fit into an approximate range of 75  105 The result of 123 is above range by roughly 175  This value may indicate body stress or an active infection being fought off by the neutrophils Most of the results that you reported are on the high end of the normal range For example your husbands Ast value of 63 is more than double the high end range of 27 and can sometimes indicate a liver disturbance Of course please do not worry  sometimes we just need an immediate answer that could make some sense I am not a doctor and am not familiar with your husbands medical history My answer represents a good faith effort to be helpful and is by no means a definitive conclusion with guarantees of accuracy The serum blood results could also mean that something else entirely is afoul or have little overall significance All of the testing must be looked at collectively by a medical professional and in conjunction with a physical exam of the patient in order to arrive with an accurate diagnosis I suggest that your husband followup with his doctor for additional testing and possible referrals to other medical specialists Completing the antibiotic treatment may also prove to be helpful I hope that his health soon improves and wish you well what are herpes sores Its anyones guess why her doctor requested she come into the office If only a thyroid blood test were done at the laboratory then it seems that the results are likely abnormal But this is not unusual The dose of thyroid hormone replacement can vary as we age and she may simply need an adjustment of her dose Her doctor will want to ask her a few questions to make sure that your wife isnt taking other medications that would interfere with the absorption or metabolism of her thyroid pills Medications such as iron in multivitamins or an antacid tablet could alter her blood tests Typically the tests are straightforward but as a physician you want to make sure that theres not something else going on before making an adjustment to a medication shes been taking for some years I am 29 yrs old and have also been experiencing very thin hair embarrassing thin hair in the front and top of my scalp as well as lowered sex drive Ive had blood tests for thyroid and low hormones and all tests came back normal but I still feel there is a big unanswered question Ive also been told that stress and pain in the body can cause this so maybe life is stressing you out a bit more than you may be willing to acknowledge I know I deny being stressed out However I am searching for more concrete answers just like you so if you find any helpful information to share please do Sincerely CC from SB You could be If you have a normal 28 day cycle you would of ovulated around the 15th if you had unprotected sex around that day you could of conceived Id say take a home pregnancy test if still negative ask your dr for another blood test Good luck to you You may have to undergo an endoscopy to biopsy your small intestine to confirm that you have Celiac Disease Typically a blood test may be done first since it can be an indicator and is less invasive but a biopsy is better at confirming a diagnosis You may also want to attempt an elimination diet to determine any food allergies sensitivities or intolerances that you may have This type of diet starts out very basic and restrictive but you will gradually start to reintroduce certain foods back into your diet one at a time and monitor your bodys response If you have an allergy or sensitivity you may notice side effects when you reintroduce different foods This isnt meant to replace a proper diagnosis but it can help provide you with an association and causal relationship Another option might be to keep a food journal and write down your dietary intake each day You may be able to better identify triggers and notice trends between symptoms and foods consumed by doing so It may then be worthwhile for you to discuss treatment and management options with other health professionals like another doctor or a registered dietitian yes dont know dont know Im sorry youre coping with  which is an autoimmune condition that renders the body unable to process gluten a component of wheat and causes the body to attack its own small intestine when gluten is consumed Your doctor did the right thing in advising you to avoid foods that contain gluten In fact this is the only treatment for Celiac disease However it sounds like you might have been offered more resources and support than you received You might want to consult a medical provider who specializes in digestive disorders to have your diagnosis confirmed and receive more specific counseling Because Celiac disease isnt just a digestive disorder but also causes damage to your small intestine its important you understand how to manage this disease A specialist may be able to offer you that type of thorough support WebMD also offers a great  You might consider checking in there to find the Celiac disease group and start chatting with others who share your condition Wishing you well Im sorry your son is going through this  and you too Its hard when our children develop a medical problem We feel so helpless It sounds like youre doing all the right things by seeking medical attention for this high blood pressure in your son If you had these tests done on an emergency basis I recommend following up with your sons primary care provider If all the scary causes of your sons high blood pressure have been ruled out then you need to have a serious talk with your regular doctor or nurse practitioner about your sons diet and exercise as being overweight and not getting enough exercise are key culprits in hypertension in people of all ages Wishing you and your son well This is an interesting question and Im glad you asked it In order to develop an allergy to a substance you have to be exposed to it In other words its extremely rare to experience an allergic reaction to something on first exposure Its not impossible but its fairly rare One good example is penicillin Millions of people took penicillin as children and suffered no ill effects Many of those people today have penicillin allergies That early exposure caused their bodies to mount an extreme immune reaction to penicillin later on That could be what happened to you too If a physician confirmed your allergy you need to take it to heart Allergies not only can come on later in life they can get worse over time So that diarrhea from eating eggs today could turn into anaphylaxis eventually You also should be aware that people with a documented egg allergy may be discouraged from getting flu shots Id suggest you talk with your health care provider to see if this restriction applies to you Sorry youre going through this Its difficult to give up a wellloved food Unfortunately there is not There are dozens of types of  and no blood test that can detect any of them In men health care providers diagnose HPV by looking for warts on the genitals because genital warts are caused by HPV Sometimes a vinegar solution is applied with a swab to areas of the genitals with skin that looks suspicious for a genital wart However the vinegar swab test isnt foolproof If you suspect you may have HPV or believe youve been exposed to HPV or if you engage in anal sex youd be welladvised to see a physician for an examination I wish you all the best This must feel very distressing I hope to at least offer some reassurance is not uncommon That said I do think you should either return to your health care provider for followup testing or see a different doctor The benefit of returning to the provider you saw last time is that he or she has your medical history and past test results for comparison Many conditions including thyroid issues can cause hair loss Just because they didnt show up on your lab work a year ago doesnt mean they wont show up now You also should know that there is a condition called female pattern baldness that affects a number of women but this doesnt usually show up until a woman reaches her 40s I wish you all the best in finding out why your lovely locks are falling out Most home pregnancy tests today are pretty sensitive You can test again any time youd like To get the most accurate reading test first thing in the morning when your urine is the most concentrated Also be sure to follow the package instructions especially the part about timing the test Accurate timing is crucial for getting an accurate result Use a timer if necessary In the meantime if you think you could possibly be pregnant you should live as if you are  Eat healthy foods dont smoke and avoid alcohol until you know for sure if youre pregnant or not Please remember also that most communities offer lowcost or nocost care to women who are or think they may be pregnant You can learn more about your health care options by calling a local hospital or by using a webbased search engine Try typing in your citys name and the words womens health Best wishes to you Im so sorry to hear about your experience but Im glad this woman was responsible enough to inform you of her HIVpositive status A single exposure to does not necessarily cause infection But it certainly can The only way you can tell if you are infected with HIV is by getting a blood test I suggest you see a medical professional and get this blood test done as soon as possible The sooner you know your HIV status the sooner you can take steps to treat the virus if you do have it There is a myth that femaletomale transmission of HIV is a rare occurrence but science does not bear this out At least one large study has shown that either sex can transmit the virus to the other at about the same rate So do not delay getting that blood test Also you need to avoid having unprotected sex at least until you know your HIV status Its never a good idea to have unprotected sex frankly and you probably should get screened for other sexually transmitted diseases since youve had casual unprotected sex with someone you know has a serious STD I wish you all the best with this and hope for a negative result Im sorry to hear youre going through this It sounds miserable and worrisome I want to emphasize your need to stay hydrated even if drinking water gives you nausea Maybe try drinking water at different temperatures to see if one is more palatable than another Or see if theres a vitamin water flavored water or type of sports drink you can tolerate Despite the fact youve been tested for and other conditions in the past my advice to you is to keep pursuing a cause for your symptoms Some conditions take a long time to be diagnosed such as  Sometimes tests need to be repeated periodically and the results compared in order to reach a diagnosis Its OK to be very proactive with your health care providers in pushing for additional testing or repeated tests depending on how much time has elapsed in order to get a diagnosis Id suggest keeping copies of all your lab results and imaging films Usually these can be provided to you on CDs for easy storage Youll want to keep these for new doctors you may consult and for comparison of test results over time I wish I had some magic suggestion to offer you in terms of a diagnosis but thats not the case Like I said hang in there and dont give up just because youve had a few tests done Keep going back to your providers to let them know you still have symptoms I wish you all the best Im sorry your husbands going through this Unfortunately we cant give you an answer here because DWI laws vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction What applies in your area may not apply in mine Driving under the influence of narcotics like Vicodin is a crime in many places However sometimes the judge takes into account whether or not the person had a valid prescription for the medication why the individual was taking that medication and so on Again were not lawyers here and cant say what might happen in your case I wish you all the best with this Well those lab results are a little high Keyword little Theyre not off the charts by any means The normal reference range for is 720 mgdl and the range for serum blood creatinine for a male is 07  14 mgdl So you can see yours are higher than normal but only your health care provider can interpret these results relative to your medical history Thats the key point here These results may be not good for one person but OK for another Keep in mind dehydration can cause BUN to rise so its possible thats the only thing that is going on here Both BUN and creatinine measure kidney function by the way Your health care provider should have more information for you at your followup appointment If your situation were dire your provider would have called you immediately with instructions on what to do Hope this helps This is an interesting question A blood test is not how yeast infection is diagnosed Normally a vaginal swab is taken and tested Sometimes health care providers diagnose a yeast infection simply based on history recently took antibiotics with a verbal report of symptoms now I have a vaginal discharge with itching A urine test also would not detect a vaginal yeast infection Thus Id recommend you return to your health care provider for an examination Genital blisters are not a normal feature of a yeast infection but they can be a sign of a sexually transmitted disease You deserve to find out exactly whats going on down there Wishing you all the best Well the first thing I have to ask is Is your daughter sexually active If so and shes missed a period then it might be wise for her to take a home pregnancy test At age 15 the menstrual cycle isnt necessarily settled in yet Irregular periods arent uncommon in that age group and the stomachaches and nausea could be due to stress or anxiety In other words I wouldnt jump to any conclusions If your daughter is not pregnant and the other symptoms dont go away then its worth a trip to see your primary health care provider He or she can investigate the cause of your daughters symptoms and recommend treatment Wishing you both all the best Im sorry youre going through this The symptoms youre describing could be caused by many conditions but a likely culprit is some sort of spinal issue Spinal degeneration is not uncommon as we age though I dont know how old you are and a ruptured disc in the neck can happen to anyone Either of these conditions can cause aching and tiredness of the limbs Id suggest you go back to the doctor to ask about these symptoms because it sounds like further testing might be warranted Blood work wont help diagnose a spinal injury or  I wish you all the best HI

limit my standing or sitting drastically Wearing compression stockings are the only relief they can prescribe She may have this abnormally strange vein size as well Im looking for answers myself Good luck If your stress has not caused medical problems such as hypertension etc which you would need to seek medical treatment first my advice would be to try yoga or some form of exercise Secondly try a therapist who can get to the root of your stress It is always comforting to bounce things to a therapist who is nonpartisan and can offer suggestions on how to deal with your stress Sometimes it is just changing our perceptions No A low level of ferritin may indicate that your body has a low iron stores Because you have a high cholesterol level eating foods that have a substantial amount of iron that are not high in cholesterol would be helpful Foods that fit this description include Dark green leafy vegetables such as spinach collard greens and kale Beans lentils and chickpeas Nuts and seeds

Enlarged lymph nodes in the neck and jaw area can be caused by several conditions If lymph nodes persistently remain enlarged after several weeks doctors usually consider a workup to help determine the cause Work up can include physical exam lab tests xrays and sometimes biopsy of an abnormal lymph node Some infections that commonly cause enlarged lymph nodes are strep throat mononucleosis cytomegalovirus toxoplasmosis tuberculosis and HIV infection There are many more possible infectious causes Some cancers cause enlarged lymph nodes such as head and neck cancers and lymphoma There are several other medical conditions such as lupus amyloidosis and sarcoidosis that can cause lymph node enlargement Certain medications can lead lymph node enlargement as a side effect It is best for your brother to follow up with his doctor who can evaluate the need to do further workup if lymph node enlargement persists Here is a link to an article about enlarged lymph nodes

I highly recommend you go for follow up If you cant go to the doctor who did your surgery then find another bariatric surgeon that can follow you Many factors can change your bodys need for iron For example going through menopause puts women at lower risk for iron deficiency due to the loss of menses Many times someone starts to take iron supplements and also increases iron in their diet meaning they eventually get too much iron once their stores are repleted Here are some ways to decrease your iron intake If you take a multivitamin take one without iron Check the label and eliminate foods fortifed with iron eg cereals energy bars waffles etc Lastly you can decrease the amount of meat products you eat The iron in animal foods heme is better absorbed than plant foods noneheme This

back Seeing a registered dietitian can also help You can find one at Eatrightorg The good news is your HDL is nice and high and that is protective against heart disease It could be possible that what you ate the day before affected your LDL levels but by how much is hard to say It is generally recommended to consume your usual diet for 2 weeks before testing If it is bothering you get retested after eating your normal diet For more on cholesterol levels see this WebMD article Anemia is when you do not have enough red blood cells Red blood cells contain hemoglobin which is needed to carry oxygen to all parts of the body There are several common blood tests that may be used to diagnose anemia A red blood cell count can measure the number of red blood cells that you have Hemoglobin can also be measured These two tests are included in a complete blood count or CBC  A CBC can also tell the size of the red blood cells Once anemia is suspected by either a low hemoglobin or red blood cell count other blood tests may be done to see what kind of anemia you have By checking an iron level and ferritin your doctor will be able to tell how much iron you have in your body Vitamin B12 and folate levels may be checked These are vitamins you need to make enough red blood cells Sometimes other blood test will be needed as well Rarely your doctor may have to do a test on a sample of bone marrow For more information check out our article on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Anemia After age 60 the shingles vaccine is recommended Shingles is caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox

DRINK ANYTHING BEFORE A BLOOD TEST I WAS JUST TOLD BY A FRIEND THIS PAST WEEK THAT COFFEE PLAIN HAS SUGAR SO ITS BETTER TO FAST A protein deficiency S or C your body wont fight off Vitamin K so blood turns to syrup causes stroke like it did me Im on blood thinners for life Although home pregnancy tests are relatively accurate the blood test done at your doctors office is more sensitive It is unlikely that you are or were pregnant especially since you started your period Even if you had a very early miscarriage the blood test would most likely still be positive At this point there is no way to know why the home pregnancy tests were positive I would not recommend taking supplemental iron unless you are anemic or are instructed to so by your doctor You may want to consider trying a good multivitamin which will have some iron in it Talk to your doctor about what would be best for you Taking high doses of iron when not needed can be dangerous but this would be very unlikely 8 you could have a hereditary benign syndrome I have been told the same thing As long as your other liver enzymes stay normal I was told not to be concerned Have not had a specific blood test yet Hello Noyou do not have to fast for a CBC The best way to get an uncontaminated urine specimen from a child is with urinary catherization Getting accurate results from using a bag over the genital area is nearly impossible because of the colonization of enteric colon bacteria bacteria on the skin Not clear if your child is a lttle boy or girl My vet requires it for our three dogs Apparently the heartworm medication can be toxicharmful if the dog actually has heartworms In America each state has the right and privilege of setting their own laws or regulations and this includes regulations related to the practice of medicine pharmacy dentistry or nursing Vaccinations MAKE your immune system healthier Medical provider do not test patients to see if they can take a particular vaccine There are very few contraindications for getting a shingles vaccine so I do not know what your concerns might be Research the vaccine online and you will see that many of your fears may be unfounded No there are no blood test This is a clinical and a pathological diagnosis Severe urinary tract infections  those involving the kidney  can reveal themselves on certain renal blood tests or elevated white blood counts on a CBC Otherwise a urinalysis is needed along with a urine culture and microscopic examination Based on the information in your posting it does not seem likely that this would be herpes let alone a genital herpes The most likely cause would be a contact dermatitis how in the world would you get poison ivy here anyway It could be some residual chemicals in a laundry detergent soap dryer softeners or even the elastic band of your underclothingmany things Instead of Benadryl which can cause some sensitivity reactions itself a trial of hydrocortisone may be helpful There is really no way to medical prove as specific cause if it is a contact dermatitis Herpes on the skin is painful It is composed of groups of tiny waterfilled blisters that rupture The area surrounding these tiny blisters is red and irritated It can itch but pain and tingling would be a more common symptom There are certainly other considerations so I am pleased you are seeing a medical provider for a handson examination No This is not a fasting test We use a very accurate and easy URINE test for Chlamydia and gonorrhea called a DNA probe The urethral swab can still be used but the urine test is easier and less traumatic for the male patient A blood test can be used especially if testing for other STDs like HIV or syphilis Trying to guess another medical providers rationale for doing tests is like predicting what my wife wants me to do on my day off Impossible A blood test for pregnancy is considered to be more accurate in detecting pregnancy than a urine test so many providers will do a blood test as a backup I have no idea why your doctor would do any prenatal tests if you are not pregnant but an Rh factor will not change so perhaps she is just adding it to the blood tests so that you can avoid getting stuck again Just a guess Your doctor is trying to determine why you are spotting so this is just the beginning of the diagnostic testing No The most common reason for a positive drug test is drugs What KIND of blood test There are many How much marijuana It would be best to truthfully disclose your marijuana use to the medical provider who ordered the test so heshe can research this issue No the flu shot 15 minutes before would have no effect on your white blood cell count Not likely Blood tests are specific There are really no normal blood tests If you or your medical provider have a need to know your estrogen level it must be specifically ordered A skilled phlebotomist can find a vein by just feeling palpating it A visual view is not necessary Apply a warm compress and allowing the arm to hang down prior to the blood draw would be helpful and ask for a phlebotomist that is skilled drawing blood from  They are used to those tiny hardtofind veins Based on a list of symptoms alone there is really no way to blindly determine over the Internet if a person is pregnant or have something more serious You will need to have a handson examination with your primary care medical provider or your OBGYN You will most likely need some diagnostic blood tests or perhaps even an ultrasound Not usually Assuming the planetraveller drinks plenty of water and not alcohol and is not dehydrated most blood tests I dont know what kind you are getting should not be adversely influenced I dont know how your doctors are treating you now medications but if you feel you are not being managed aggressive enough you can always choose to see a different gastroenterologist Doctors are really like chefsthey all cook a bit differently No but many times the medical provider orders some additional tests that may require fasting When it doubt call the lab where you will be getting your blood drawn No problem Many times a diagnosis of measles at age three may have been incorrect Measles is relatively rare in the US so unless you saw a definitive test that PROVED you had measles getting a vaccine would be appropriate If you have immune antibodies the measles injection will not be harmful If you didnt have antibodies against measles the vaccine will provide them for you now Nothere are no blood tests that would determine if you had a stroke or a seizure No Plan B is a hormone It will not show up in your blood test for mono Your secret will be safe No there are no blood tests used to diagnose gallstones Gallstones are typically diagnosed by ultrasound or an xray gall bladder series Yes there is a topical prescription medication called DrySol that you can use on the sweaty areas This is a potent antiperspirant Nicotine clears in the blood in one to two days A serum ferritin level is a blood test It is not very expensive There are no other ways to determine this level This class of drug has to be specifically tested forit is not automatically included in all drug screening tests Get a copy of the test and see If they are testing for benzodiazepine drugs then it should show up if you are taking it and your medication is not a fake pharmaceutical It is not unusual for fake medications made to look like the real thing to show up at some pharmacies Make sure to keep one of them just in case the pill itself needs testing Blood tests ALWAYS must be correlated with physical examination findings and medical history  things that I do not know so it is best to have your medical provider the one who order the tests explain them to you so there is no confusion or speculation about the meaning of those results Not a blood test but a DNA swab from the inside of your cheeks or saliva can determine if you have male or female chromosomes If a person has a sex change  surgically and hormonally challenged  the chromosomes do not change nor can they be changed The Olympics uses this type of test to determine eligibility to compete No A positive drug test is still a positive drug test Urine is used as the standard not blood You have an anxiety disorder so you will likely worry no matter what I tell you Unfortunately it would be impossible to determine the true nature of your recent event based solely on the information in your posting so you will need to wait until you see your doctor  someone who knows your medical history and can examine you If your doctor or cardiologist feels it is clinically important they can order an event monitor where you can record any future episodes as an ECG for later review This should help you httpwwwwebmdcomatozguidescompletebloodcountcbc Call the medical provider and ask why he or she did not feel an abdominal or male genital exam was not a necessary part of a complete physical Dont let them get away with itThe very least the medical provider should bring you back to do these components and not charge you or your insurance company one penny There is no excuse for cutting important corners when it comes to medical care It depends on the normal blood tests that your doctor orders As you know there are thousands of different blood tests He would need to specifically order a drug screening panel to detect the marijuana use you may be trying to hide This early a pregnant woman may not have sufficient HCG to be detected on those tests so repeat them the blood test in a few weeks So yes you can be pregnant If you are having sex not using birth control and you and your partner is not sterile it is only a matter of time before a pregnancy will happen That is inexcusable As difficult as it may be to find a new doctor that is more thorough and responsible I think you should look around for an INTERNIST Internists are usually very current with diabetes management and with patients who have multiple health problems I am not sure why you are on longterm prednisone but this can have an association with your blood sugar Here is a site that can answer your question more completely httpwwwnlmnihgovmedlineplusencyarticle003551htm Yes it can especially if the urinary tract infection results in systemic symptoms like fever or involves the kidneys well now that you are pregnant i would suggest that you go ahead and stop drinking the redline if you stop early enough i doubt there would be any damage done but i would not continue to drink it while being pregnant also if you plan to breast feed just remember that what ever you intake into your body your baby will get it as well through the milk See another doctor anxiety is not fun xanax would help keep your mind from being over active and help you sleep calm you down See a psychiatrist thats what I did my parents in denial also They think seeing a shrink means your crazy but all it is is a chemical imbalance in the brain sambalukyahoocom Soma or Carisoprodol is a generic drug and is used for the treatment of muscle pain and muscle injury It is used by the person who is suffering from muscle sprain and pain You can from chemist shop or online at Blood testing for chlamydia I dont think so Urine and swab testing are the ways to go  YES I take Percocet daily and my doctor keeps a close eye on my liver count Does your doctor know you are taking pain meds and for how long The literature you receive with your meds tells you that it can cause liver damage If he wont listen I would find a new doctor I dont know Do not worry just do as your doctors has asked to because they know better the situation and know what problems could face your husband during this period Thank you for the response I dont know if that will work though I mean its been happening since last monday  Try dmg sublingual google DMG for use good for many ailments Sometimes referred to as B15 may be effective in some persons possible benefits for ADHD enhancement Autism muscular use  No side effects ever seen enhances metabolism and may other health related conditions Dumb questionask the doctor that prescribed the med or ask a pharamist It sounds like tha going around Id definitly get them to the hospitol so theres no dehydrationt flu or virus thats I would definitly take her or take her back to the emergency room and let them do more tests What I found when I searched your answer was floppy eye syndrom but Im not sure if thats what it is I will still mention it to the doc when I go soon There doesnt seem to be much irritation under the eyelid though my eye lashes on the more tired side do flare down more like the symptoms of floppy eye Theres no abnormal discharge My instinct is that it could be Myasthenia Gravis but my PCP didnt seemed very concerned Im really frustrated because I know people see that one side of my face looks exuasted while the otherside looks like its in shock Nothing really stood out from the blood tests done at the PCP so I wasnt told to do anything else about it Should I take it upon myself to set up an appt with a Neurologist I dont want to keep forking out money to be told things seem normal I dont want to wait for symptoms to get worse and Ive waited to this point to see if things would get better Are their any other eye problems that are similar to MG and floppy eye Are there better test to request from the eye doc or pcp Your period can be irregular  Overexercising for instance can affect your period So can stress and dieting If you are young irregular periods are common If you are older you may be starting menopause If it continues you should probably get checked by your doctor to make sure nothing else is going on You failed to mention your age That could have a lot to do with your bone problems And you cannot get a MRI without a Doctors order If you are seeing your primary care Dr Ask him if he would refer you to an Orthopedic Dr for and evaluation Or second opinion Maybe her will order your MRI The antibiotics should not effect your blood test They may show up in a blood test But should not effect what ever your Dr is looking for by ordering a blood test By getting the blood test your doctor may find something else And change the Cipro to another type of medication If you got an order from the Dr who gave you the antibiotic Cipro to have blood work done You should have it done You failed to say what type of blood test was ordered And or why it was  Yes Al those greens are a great choice to stick with Even a little white wine should not effect your occult fecal blood test No I have been chewing for years and have never found it to show up in a drug test As nicotine is the only drug in it The primary care provider who ordered the blood workup for you should recommend a neurologist I had a small breakout on the end of my nose but the shingles were actually internalup my nose and in my ears and throat Hello I spent the last 3 months having herpes like symptoms and after a series of tests  doctors it was finally discovered that I had an E Coli infection on the skin around my genitals It was very painful caused similar symptoms as herpes with tingling ulcers etc but easily addressed with antibiotics I would encourage your doctor to not only test for herpes but to swab for a bacterial or yeast infection as it may be something more benign than what you think it is Dont get too overwhelmed by what you read on the internet until you have something properly diagnosed I know it can be months of agony but hang in there For females the reference range for BUN is 724 mgdL For Creatinine the reference range is 0510 mgdL When I was pregnant with my youngest son my test showed no pregnancyI kept thinking that I was pregnant so I went and got a blood test and it said yes Its not likely you have HIV but good for you for being responsible and taking the the first steps Are you in the UK Most of the main hospitals have a GUM clinic and they usually offer a counselling service before you get the test know your not alone if your really scared I would do this just getting it out there will make you feel better I had a needle stick accident working with street sex workers once whilst visiting them in a house that was not too clean I sobbed for 10 hours knowing that it had a higher than usual chance of having HIV on it but I went to see the therapist and felt so much better I had something called ART therapy for six wks its a course of HIV meds to block out the virus that you can have if you have been put in a high risk category of contracting the virus that is a very strong HIV medication in a high dose that had toxic side effects only to be used if you believe your at risk I dont know how they test but I kno I heard on the news that it takes 24 to 48 hrs to confirm ebola normally its better to have the blood test 10 days after having sex to give time for levels to go up to show a positive result if you do a urine pregnancy test you normally do that maybe a couple days or the day after you missed your period are you doing a home test or at a Dr office To update her thyroid meds That could possibly be HYPERthyroidism Can be treated your doctor is doing the best thing by retesting If you could fast for the test that probably would be best Good Luck yes you need to fast at least 10 hr to see what is in your blood stream on average to prevent skewed result Sounds like when my bowel was blocked 4 days in Hosp Upper and lower GI Barium Xrays CT showed nothing blood work showed nothing at first Finally colonoscopy found 98 percent blockage and I had a bowel resection and was diagnosed with Chrohns This was after 7 years of treatment for IBS At least I know what I am fighting now Have lost 50lbs as well Best of luck Knowing is half the battle just wondering if he has ever had any problems with his heart that was the first thing that came to mind when i read your comment could be something more simple though i would keep trying to find out what is wrong i would get a second or even third opinon if needed  I just had these run last week You do not need to fast too much fat in stools cause by pancerous not working rightshe needs to see a Pediatriciannot a FAMILY DR could also be related to digestive tract issues Hello there herpes is one of hardest viruses to diagnose many people carry the virus in their body but may go months or even years without an outbreak the best advice i can give to you is to always use protection when sexually active and whenever you think you might be having an outbreak to see your doctor just in order to be sure I am a phlebotomist and a lady has seen 6 doctors in the 2 years time that she has had bacteria coming out of her skinsounds like this is on the same line of what she hasmaybeyou should do a lyme decease western blot test and see if you have any bandsif you have any bands then do study on those bacteria bands and see if this is curableif it is stage 1 it can probarbly be cured if it has been going on for at least 2 yrsthen it will be alonger treatment and might not be curableI am not a doctor and I could be wrongjust saying I doubt you are pregnant but have you started your period yet or soon httpwwwisrael4ude Unfortunately you may very well have genital herpes The medication your ex is taking is most likely an antiviral medication such as Valtrex or its generic version This medicaion only surpresses the outbreaks and makes an outbreak shorter in duration It does not cure herpes or stop it from spreading to another person A person who has herpes can spread it to another even when they do not have any current blisters or visual signs of an outbreak I would recommend getting a blood test That way you know for sure Also remember that each persons body reacts differently to the virus Some people get outbreaks often and they can be painful and itchy Others get an outbreak only once every few years and they are mild It all depends on your body Good Luck A complete blood count includes Hemoglobin and Hematocrit If they are low then you may have anemia A doctor may then get more blood to check your Ferritin and Iron levels Blood tests on the pancreas and liver can come back normal and there could still be gallbladder trouble The blood tests just show that the potential problem with the gallbladder hasnt started effecting the other organs yet This situation happened to me as well The ultrasound should give you much more info Good Luck My best guess would be that the first time you had your cholesterol checked you you were not fasting By plates I assume you mean platlets and those could have been higher because you werent feeling well The second time you had these done you were probably fasting or hadnt eaten very much and were feeling a bit better So sorry for your loss I believe you are asking about the numbers The numbers you describe are the level of HCG in your body The higher the number the farther along you are Since you had a miscarriage the numbers are going downthis is normal Here is a table that physicans sometimes use On left is how many weeks you are On the right is the range of HCG like the number you got Gestational age THCG weeks mIUmL range 021 550 12 50500 23 1005000 34 50010000 45 100050000 56 10000500000 68 15000200000 812 10000100000 Hope this helps Perhaps fibroid tumors If you had your period for 3 days youre not pregnant No I usually dont Try taking iron supplements your levels may be low What is considered normal on lab tests may not necessarily be normal for you Let me give you some background information The test they usually perform to initially diagnose hypothyroidism is TSH or thyroid stimulating hormone It has an inverse relationship with your actual thyroid hormone Think of it as a bill collector If you dont respond when the bill collector knocks on your door they will start to knock on your door or call you with increasing frequency until you do respond The TSH is the bill collector and if your thyroid isnt paying the bills aka isnt producing enough thyroid hormone T4 TSH levels will continue to increase until the thyroid responds or your pituitary master gland decides its a hopeless cause and TSH production decreases or stops The reason for this diatribe is because people get confused when they are told they have hypothyroidism and their TSH is too high They dont realize the TSH is not actually the thyroid hormone which is the hormone that will be low in this case I just want to ensure there is no confusion when your provider gives you lab results Some providers dont realize that if your TSH is in the upper range of normal people and especially women may still have symptoms Thus you may want to work with your doctor on getting your TSH down to the lower ranges of normal 07 2 approximately  The range used to be 05 to 5 for TSH The national board of endocrinology now suggests the normal range be changed to 03 to 3 because people are still having symptoms despite being within normal range I prefer to keep my TSH around 1 because thats when I feel normal Everybody is different so that may not work for you What it boils down to is you are a person not a lab result if you have symptoms tell your primary care doctor Do some research write down questionssymptoms when you think of them and talk to your PCP about it If you do not think he or she is taking you seriously get a second opinion thats normal it is happen to me also heheh dont worry Is she on antibiotics Amoxicillan is an antibiotic that can cause rash Its not necessarily an allergic rash just a side effect Keep up with the ibuprofen no aspirin Keep her comfy and hydrated not with sugary drinks and juices which are sugary drinks Water is best if she is not eating try some of the drinks for children that replace electrolytes and have some vitamins If she has no fever is eating and drinking ok dont get too upset Assuming she has been vaccinated against all the nasty bugs Not probably but you can get to grow your hair at a slow rate The Main advantage of it is to treat
