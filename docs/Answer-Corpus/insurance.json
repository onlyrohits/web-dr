being able to be treated with acetaminophen due to allergic reactions may be a blessing in disguise  Acetaminophen has been associated with causing ADHD behavior in children whose mothers were treated with this OTC medication Lets look at the alternatives to Acetaminophen Alternatives that should be avoided or taken with caution after discussing with your doctor  Many other OTC medications used to treat pain such as Ibuprofen and Naproxen should be used with caution avoided during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy and taken only after consulting with your physician Also aspirin is contraindicated for usage by all pregnant women Alternatives that may be considered to treat pain safely in pregnant women after physician approval The best options for treating pain in pregnant are natural remedy herbs such as follows A prescription drug that may be considered by your doctor as an alternative to acetaminophen is TramadolUltram  Natural treatments may include Muscle Massage Epson salts bathing and Chiropractor manipulation Migraine headaches can be extremely painful and deserve a through diagnostic workup to determine their cause Treatment of migraine headaches should be directed at specific causes such as stress and hormonal Identifying and removing migraine headache triggers is highly recommended Also determine if your doctor will suggest treatment options through phoneemail consulation without costing you the office visit expense Whatever our political persuasion happens to be medical coverage is a relevant issue that has should be discussed by responsible individuals Since the Affordable Care Act ACA is a United States Federal Statue individuals need to make intelligent choices Without the distribution of factual information this complex program would be a complete mystery to most citizens I respect your right to disagree with substantive points in the act But explaining the rules and debating ACA policy is a responsibility that we must all share Yes your primary care doctor can refuse to give you a referral to see a pain management doctor A physician may determine the appropriate treatment plan for their patient You have the right to call your insurance company and request a different doctor to service your needs I admire you for seeking out a conclusive way of determining whether back injury may be caused by an auto accident Of course forceful trauma resulting from a car accident may cause back injury Equally obvious is that the Insurance company doctors will deny that herniated disc can be caused by a car accident The truth of the matter is that it is virtually impossible to prove that a car accident either caused or did not cause a back injury The entire process must start by having a candid discussion with the alleged victim Is your victims story credible Does it agree with statements included in accident reports and by their treating physicians Did they have previous back problems which never completely resolved themselves Confirm to the client that the insurance carrier will vigorously uncover all back related conditions that were experienced prior to the accident A preexisting issue with the back that was never fully resolved will certainly impact the outcome of a whiplash claim No prior complaint of back pain may strengthen the clients case but proves little Most people  50 years of age suffer from some arthritis and degenerative disc changes and not have any overt symptoms Next thing that Id pick through with a magnifying glass is the treating physicians report and scan reports Does the medical professional have the facts straight as reported to you by the client Your success will hinge on being as educated as possible concerning back problems picking away at incorrect statements and assessing truthful vs untruthful answers  Legitimate and chronic pain should not have to be endured without being appropriately treated Due to medication dependence sometimes wanton street drug abuse and cost savings measures reimbursement for pain relief through insurance providers has been severely curtailed Ultracet is prescribed for moderate to severe pain It is a combination of Tramadol and Acetaminophen Ask your physician if they feel comfortable in prescribing Tramadol Reports show no difference in the therapeutic pain relief offered by Tramadol when compared to Ultacet In essence you would be taking your current medication minus the acetaminophen If your insurance carrier will not cover the Utracet perhaps they will cover Tramadol Both Tramadol and Ultracet are marketed as the hydrochloride salt by Janssen Pharmaceutical and as Ultram in the United States They have a patient assistance program to help needy individuals qualify for free medication Research the manufacturers web site for qualifying details that may include Having a valid prescription  The Ultracet cannot be covered through private insurance Medicare D or State Medicaid programs You must meet income guidelines ranging from 11 170 annually for 1 person up to 23050 annually for a household of four people For larger families the income limit is 200 of the FPIG Note The application can be cumbersome if you are currently taking more than one other medication I retired from working for a state government public assistance agencyUnder the Medicaid Program a form of public assistance it had been possible to be eligible for Retroactive Medical Assistance Retroactive coverage if all other eligibility conditions such as income and resource limits are met could have been authorized with a begin date of 3 full months prior from the first day of the month in which the application was filed For example You were in the hospital 12032013 12072013 after breaking your pelvis in a falling accident You apply for Medicaid on 3102014 to cover the hospital bill The assistance office would determine your eligibility for each month within the retroactive period including 31392014 the month of application 22014 012014 and 122013 the 3 months prior to the month in which the application was filed In order to determine retroactive eligibilitythe clients income must be verified separately for each retroactive month All medical category financial and nonfinancial requirements must be met It is possible to have retroactive eligibility for March 2014 and some of months in the 3 month look back period and to not be eligible for some of the months In the example from above the client may have been eligible for Medicaid during March 2014 February 2014 and December 2013 but ineligible during January 2013 Although changes are happening at a rapid pace with medical insurance it is worth a chance to apply for retroactive medical assistance through your local welfare department thank you for that but sex has been the same since im living with my bf Medicaid and Medicare does Go see MD ASAP My son had what we thought was a spider bite on his leg It did the same thing got very red and painful It ended up being MRSA Had to get my son on antibiotics fast Warm compresses will bring the puss up to the surface but the puss is very contagious MRSA is very common now but can be fatal Dont wait Better to be safe than sorry Yes you will keep losing If the doctor fixes your overactive thyroid with medication you will not There are benefits to having an overactive thyroid but medically you must get it fixed for other reasons the thyroid runs many functions in your body not just metabolism I would stay off the synthroid until I get to my goal body weight JEALOUS The doctor would not like this answer though You only buy the brand Call the pharmaceutical company and see if they have payment assistance Most do My daughters employer switched retirees to another plan Even her disability annuity is less She has just undergone colon surgery and the new plan does not offer her required med supplies nursing home for rehab even her disability annuity is less READ WHERE A LOT OF CORPORATIONS have done this  tired of everything being blamed on Obama What are people doing especially thru the surgeries infections wound pumps  when something like this happens My daughter I believe found out after major surgery less required supplies her 30 day nursing home has already been met  but a friend cut out an article about a large corporation and their plan to change last year Her previous plan was great  sad so what does a person do It is really important if you have a lot of moles and freckles and have had exposure to sun over the time which is what freckles imply that you have a regular skin cancer screening There are lots of ways that you can have a free screening done and you can try going to your local hospital and see if they have annual skin cancer screenings that are for free and have your moles checked that way and then if anything looks suspicious the doctor will recommend that you see a dermatologist to have that mole removed Accutane is a really great drug for acne and I have found that where nothing else works Accutane can actually be lifechanging and that it really controls the acne very effectively But there is a lot of discussion that has to go around it and there is a cost factor as well One important point is that Accutane no longer exists It is now only in generic form The generic name is oral Isotretinoin So your doctor may give a prescription for Accutane and thats what you will take to the pharmacist but what you get wont be the name Accutane it will be the same active drug but under a different name just so you are prepared for that In terms of cost it can be very costly however you can shop around But the generics generally are at a lower cost than the original Accutane was to begin with Accutane is one of my  or Accutane in the generic form now is one of my favorite drugs to treat acne However its not a cure Oftentimes and it is actually oftentimes after you stop it the acne can recur Often not as bad as it was before you took Accutane but you still have to treat the acne over time in most patients This is usually used with topical products and sometimes even a second course of this oral Isotretinoin Accutane product if needed If that acne persists even after that then I look for hormonal imbalances especially in women and I find that when women have the adult pattern of acne which is usually on the lower face and along the jawline even if their periods are regular if I manage it oral contraceptives which you need to be on if you are taking oral Isotretinoin anyway but if I manage it with oral contraceptives and even add on some other medicines You can become allergic to the ink at any time or any medicine that you are taking also You can become allergic to it even though you have been on it for a very long time So if you are having a reaction one thing is that it could be an allergic reaction but it could also just be something that is occurring in the area of the tattoo that has something to do with the tattoo but because there is pigment there you cant really see the skin clearly So I would say that this is one time that even though you dont have insurance it is worth seeing a dermatologist to have the area evaluated to make sure that the skin is otherwise healthy Oftentimes with a simple cream they can knock out that allergic reaction if thats what it is or the hypersensitivity reaction another way of calling it or do a biopsy to see if there is anything else going on in that area that might be more serious that might need to be treated Simply go through Natural treatment Natural treatment or organic treatment is one of the best solution to cure Spider Bit Baking Powder and some components include vitamin C and Salicylicacid are consider the best home remedies for treatment Im sorry to hear financial concerns have affected your ability to obtain the medications you need for your bipolar condition Id urge you to speak to your local Medicaid office to see if you can qualify for health care assistance That said I admire the fact youre being aware and cautious Its great you havent experienced any major symptoms after three weeks of going off the meds but as you know with bipolar a serious mood swing can occur at any time To prepare for this possibility I suggest you write down the telephone number of a crisis hotline so you can get help if you need it Also write down the office number of the doctor who was treating you before you went off the meds Even though you dont have insurance now if you find yourself in crisis it would be a good idea to inform your doctor Of course if you experience any thoughts of suicide or hurting yourself please call 911 immediately I wish you all the best Im sorry youre going through this Its always scary when we have a problem with our eyes The first thing to clarify is this Is it your actual eyeball thats twitching Or is it your eyeLID Twitching of the eyelid is called and is quite common It tends to come and go as you described It can get worse and more frequent from time to time and then clear up for long periods Stress fatigue and caffeine are common culprits of blepharospasm If its your eyeball thats twitching that would be more worrisome to me When a persons eyeballs twitch its usually both of them If your eyeball itself is the problem Id advise you to see a doctor I realize you said you dont have insurance but most communities have free or lowcost health care clinics You could start by getting checked at one of those just to calm any fears you may have about this situation I wish you all the best The sequence of events here is a little unclear to me It sounds like you had your gallbladder removed recently and also have other symptoms that sound unrelated to your gallbladder problem If you had your gallbladder removed recently and you have three or four small incisions including one in your belly button then you had  During this procedure several small incisions are made in your abdomen and instruments are inserted through them To make this process work your abdomen is inflated with harmless carbon dioxide gas The unfortunate side effect of this gas is postsurgery bloating and sometimes pain At times the pain can occur in the shoulder area This is normal and should go away within several days Vomiting after gallbladder surgery also is not uncommon If you follow a lowerfat diet it should help with the vomiting issue If you had gallbladder surgery recently you should be scheduled for followup appointments with your surgeon Please keep these appointments Your surgeon will be able to tell you if your recovery is progressing normally The pimples and sores in your underarm thigh and nipple area do not sound like theyre related to your gallbladder issues Digestive system issues usually do not manifest as skin problems I would suggest you consult a dermatologist or even your primary care physician to take a look at these lesions to find out what they are and whats causing them I hope this helps and wish you all the best Im sorry to hear youre going through this Of course its not possible to diagnose whats going on via a forum like this It could be your  but then again it could also be a problem with a in the shoulder  a pinched nerve in your arm or neck tendinitis muscle strain  quite a few things The only way to tell for sure whats going on and get appropriate treatment is by having a physical exam Even though you dont have insurance you may be able to find affordable care at a free or lowcost health clinic in your area Some clinics charge a fee based on a sliding scale Others such as healthcare for the homeless are entirely free You might be able to find these clinics by searching on the internet You might also want to see if you qualify for Medicaid coverage if youre in the US I wish I could tell you how to treat your problem but without a diagnosis its just not possible Some of the conditions I listed above may resolve with rest while others require medication or as a last resort surgery I wish you all the best Im sorry youre going through this It sounds absolutely miserable Because this situation is now going on three weeks I would suggest you get it checked out You may be able to avoid the emergency room and the high fees involved by searching in your community for a free or lowcost health care clinic Sometimes these have the name healthcare for the homeless but you usually dont have to be homeless to take advantage of the services I cannot provide a hotlink here but if you visit httpwwwhrsagovgethealthcareaffordableindexhtml you can search for lowcost health care in your area I wish you all the best with this Oh ouch That sounds painful For those who dont know the frenulum linguae sometimes called the lingual frenulum is that piece of saillike tissue that attaches the tongue to the floor of the mouth Youre wise to be concerned about infection The main sign you should watch for is a fever over 101F along with generally feeling crappy  as if you might be coming down with the flu Those would both be indications to seek medication attention In the meantime you might try gently rinsing with antiseptic mouthwash a couple of times a day dont go overboard with this as that could be counterproductive You can continue to brush your teeth but spit gently The good news is your tongue and mouth in general tend to heal quickly You probably will be all healed up within a couple of weeks tops If your frenulum linguae doesnt heal or if it gets swollen angry and red then Id suggest you see a doctor Chances are you wont have to resort to that though Hope this helps Well Id suggest you at least call the doctor who diagnosed your to discuss these symptoms Usually a person whos diagnosed with anemia is put on a treatment regimen thats appropriate to the type of anemia for example iron supplements or B12 injections Unfortunately only your doctor can explain what might be going on with your health and recommend treatment You may be able to have this conversation by phone in order to avoid an office visit charge but it depends on the health care provider Im sorry youre feeling so ill and hope you get some answers soon Im sorry to hear you lost an ovary at such a young age and that its causing you anxiety 5 years later The situation you describe a twisted ovary or ovarian torsion is relatively uncommon The majority of cases about 75 occur in women under age 30 Ovarian torsion is caused by an underlying problem such as unusually long fallopian tubes or congested veins in the blood supply that serves the ovary Its unfortunate your surgeon didnt give you a report as to the underlying cause for your ovarian torsion Possibly you could still obtain the records from the surgery in an effort to determine what the cause was This would be useful from the standpoint that a gynecologist could give you a better idea of whether or not the situation may recur with the other ovary Although you have no health insurance you should still be able to obtain health care at any of the many free or lowcost womens health clinics around the country If theres not one in your immediate city try to find one in a nearby town In addition check with your local Medicaid office to find out if you qualify for free health insurance through your state program Its crucial you obtain a Pap smear and pelvic exam just for your overall health and wellbeing Meanwhile try to keep a positive attitude and know theres no way to prevent an ovarian torsion You simply need to be vigilant to the symptoms you experienced before If you begin to experience any of those symptoms again sudden extreme abdominal pain accompanied by nausea fever or a racing heartbeat get quickly to an emergency room and inform the doctor youve had a previous ovary removed due to torsion Ovaries sometimes can be saved if ovarian torsion is diagnosed quickly enough Best wishes to you As a plastic and reconstructive surgery nurse I worked with many women who had large breasts that caused rashes or neck pain Heres what I can tell you The type of procedure youre looking for is breast reduction not augmentation will reduce the overall size of your breasts as well as perking them up so they sit in a more natural position Many insurance companies will cover breast reduction under certain conditions For example serious neck pain that doesnt respond to any other treatment like physical therapy and can be attributed to large breasts may be covered With rashes insurance companies seem in my experience less likely to cover breast reduction unless the rashes recur frequently and have not responded to other treatments You need to have documentation that youve seen your primary care provider multiple times and have tried prescription creams or whatever without clearing up the rashes for more than short periods of time Also with rashes your insurance may be less likely to cover the procedure if youre obese because in theory reducing the size of your abdomen might help the rash problem If youve tried without success to medically treat the rashes Id suggest you schedule an appointment with a plastic and reconstructive surgeon to discuss your options He or she wont be able to tell you if your insurance will cover a breast reduction but the surgeon can give you an opinion on whether you might benefit from breast reduction and can submit the claim for prior authorization After that its up to the individual insurer You need to know that breast reduction can impair your ability to nurse a baby Its doubtful youd be completely unable to nurse but removing breast tissue does reduce the number of milk ducts which can reduce the volume of milk your baby is able to get from nursing Hope this helps Hm You raise an interesting question Its true that broken bones may be more prone to developing arthritis It helps to understand that which is what were talking about here doesnt necessarily mean the development of painful bony spurs in a joint which is what a lot of people think Technically osteoarthritis refers to the raw edges of two pieces of bone rubbing together painfully We usually think of osteoarthritis as something that comes on gradually over the course of years because that is how the disease usually progresses in healthy tissue Osteoarthritis is called the wear and tear disease because under normal circumstances the cartilage between bones in a joint wears away over the decades until the two pieces of bone grind against each other However the course may be different for osteoarthritis caused by trauma such as a broken bone Id suggest you sit down with your doctor and have him or her define arthritis for you so that you understand better what theyre talking about They should also be able to explain in very clear terms how it is arthritis could develop in your foot so quickly I hope this information helps A fall like the one you describe definitely can cause muscle stiffness and soreness throughout the entire body In fact a fall like that can cause painful back spasms in particular You should see a doctor if Symptoms get worse after 3 days or so You begin to have difficulty breathing or shortness of breath You begin to run a fever You experience numbness shocklike pains or a running water sensation in your arms or hands You have difficulty urinating Otherwise you probably are safe to take a waitandsee approach to this Muscle spasms and soreness may resolve on their own or they may require medical intervention Only time will tell Feel better soon I certainly understand her reluctance to seek medical attention when she doesnt have insurance Many communities offer free or lowcost clinics to people who are uninsured Maybe you can help her find one of these I think your daughter needs to get this checked out It may be completely benign such as a lipoma a fatty noncancerous tumor But then again it could be something more serious Certainly if your daughter has a fever or is experiencing unintended weight loss she needs to be checked out as soon as possible You might encourage your daughter also by reminding her the cost of an office visit is substantially less than the cost of an emergency room visit so why put off getting this thing looked at I wish your daughter all the best Im sorry to hear youre dealing with this It sounds exhausting Although you dont have insurance you need to get checked out by a doctor Chronic can have many bad side effects such as causing a mineral imbalance that affects your heart Most cities even small ones offer free or lowcost health care clinics Some of these clinics allow people to pay on a sliding fee scale This means the fee is based on your income and expenses You can get information about these clinics by contacting your local Medicaid office Or use a search engine and type in the name of your city followed by free health clinics Meanwhile its very important you drink plenty of water Chronic diarrhea can cause severe dehydration I wish you all the best in getting the problem diagnosed and treated Im going to say that unless youre having trouble breathing you probably do not need to get an Xray done Its pretty hard to break a rib from an unintentional punch though of course anythings possible Even if the rib is cracked theres not much treatment for it except to bind it You might try using a wide compression Ace bandage to see if that helps the pain but dont wrap it excessively tight Gentle support is fine Another possibility is that you tore some cartilage between ribs That can be very painful and more bad news can take a long time to heal This could account for why youre still having pain The only treatment for this type of injury is rest and time If the pain gets worse over time instead of better if you develop a fever chills or flulike symptoms or if you suddenly have trouble breathing then its definitely time to get checked out by a doctor insurance or no insurance Otherwise I think you can take a waitandsee approach to this Overthecounter pain relievers used according to package directions might give you some relief too I hope you feel better soon If you find out that you will be responsible for paying the cost of drug detox treatment andor rehab do not let that discourage you from getting help Talk to the detox facility andor rehab to see if they offer any discounts or scholarships It could be you qualify for a special program Another option for covering the cost is to see if the detox center rehab works with a finance company or can recommend a finance company that other patients have worked with to cover the balance Sometimes this is a good option because it will allow you to spread the balance out over several months Many facilities offer a considerable discount to patients who are able to pay cash up front as well Asking all these questions could land you some nice discounts and an more affordable rate for your budget If you find a facility that is highly recommended to you  dont be afraid to tell them how much you want to receive their service The seemingly most inexpensive route is a government funded detox or rehab Government funded means that the program is funded by state and federal money As for how much drug detox andor rehab costs for these programs it is possible to pay a few hundred dollars and under and in some cases they are of no cost  depending of funding Traditional hospital detox or rehab may cost from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand depending on how much funding they receive from the government or outside agencies Although there are some luxury highend private detox facilities and rehabs where the cost can start at 10000 per day  it is also important to know that some private treatments may cost about 1000 per day and offer some extra amenities Gallus Detox Center is a private inpatient detox facility that specializes in IV therapy medical detox If you have questions about our facility or detox method please call us at 8553386929 There is nothing over the counter however the manufacturer of the drug used to prevent outbreaks Valtrex does have a patient assistance program which once you sign up will mail you a 3 month supply of the drug at one time When that three months is almost over you will receive the next package At the end of a year youll have to be reassessed but if you still dont have insurance you will still qualify The manufacturer is GlaxoSmith Kline the name of the program is Bridges to Access and heres the link httpwwwbridgestoaccesscom I hope this helps Carrie Hi brendabreezy  My mother and I have gone through this Your oxygen level most likely is dropping at night due to sleep apnea which is when you stop breathing for a period of time every few minutes usally while snoring and thus your not getting enough oxygen in your lungs brain heart ect An oxygen level of 78 is very low so they may want to do blood tests to rule out blood disorders and due a check on your white blood cell count and see if any of the labs show whatt could be causing your fatiguel If not something else could be going on In my Mothers and my cases we both have COPD corany obstrutive pulminary disease You can have that with Bronchitis andor Emphysima as it is a respiratory disorder that does end up doing damage to your lungs as well as your heart over time But with your other problems I can only take a wild guess You should write down or type all your questions for the doctor make copy for yourself to make sure Dr doesnt just skip over the hard quesions and see what he is trying to find out and what is already ruled out Depression can affect your healing process as mind over matter isnt just a saying And if you no longer have insurance see if you will qualify for a Medicaid card with your income level If not there are clinics that charge low prices for the working poor but you will have to call around to find them Good Luck JJ Sorry to hear about this difficulty The doctor who initially prescribed the medication may be a good starting point to ask for information about resources in your area There are some programs that the drug manufacturer has that helps those who need the drug The prescribing doctor can help you explore these options Janumet is a combination product containing Januvia and metformin Both medications are used to help decrease sugar levels found in blood circulation after eating a meal but by different mechanisms of actions Metformin is a generic medication that can be found at several pharmacies on their special pricing lists for one month and three month supplies However Januvia is still a brand medication as well as Janumet There are plenty of different combinations of diabetes medications that can be used to lower sugar levels However if sugar levels are being maintained with this combination product I would not switch Check with your insurance company to see if there is a lower copay for using Januvia versus Janumet If so you still can get the same coverage as Janumet by taking the two ingredients Januvia and metformin There arent medications in the same drug class but there are medications available to help lower sugar levels by a different means of action within the body Start by contacting your insurance to see what they cover and at what copay costs Work with your pharmacist and physician to see what will work best for diabetes coverage specific to your husbands needs Check around with pharmacies to see if they have different generic lists of medications they cover at a lower cost that may be lower than your insurance Lastly talk to your doctor to see if heshe has any copay assistance cards Many brand medications do have an assistance program to aid with copays  httpwwwdenplancouk httpwwwdpascouk httpwwwprivilegeplancouk You can get more information about it at httpwwwzebondentalcoukpriceshtml Well if its happening in your lower back I would say that it could be a UTI Does it feel like you have to pee alot Most dental insurance providers cover some or all of the cost of dentures However contact your company to find out the specifics of what they will cover In general dental implants are not covered by dental insurance at this time Coverage under your medical plan may be possible depending on the insurance plan andor cause of tooth loss Detailed questions about your individual needs and how they relate to insurance should be discussed with your dentist and your insurance provider There are physicians certified in Addiction Medicine at County and State facilities who are able to offer assistance at very reasonable rates for residents You can check on this via the American Society of Addiction Medicine  In addition you can also research where 12 Step meetings are held and attend or call the listed number to ask for help it could be the left tonsilLook at it with a flashlight by looking at the throat If you see anything white white dots they need to see a doctor That is usually a sign of Strep Throat which can be extremely dangerous if not treated right away with antibiotics If the tonsil looks healthy then it could also be a lymph node wound care yes but you need to see a MD for possible antibiotic treatment Unusually that you dont appear to have presented a query below but life assurance There are several certainties in existence Small individuals insurance and demise fees charging lots of cash  simply the way in which its The reason is is that Prevacid has recently been approved to go overthecounter So thats probably one of the reasons why the insurance is not covering it anymore However though it all depends on the persons insurance Insurances have list of medications that they will pay for called formularies and its not uncommon for drugs to go on formulary and off of formulary So as a pharmacist when I get a prescription and I process it through the insurance they usually tell me this type of information So if you are unsure you can ask us But once again if you look at the back of your insurance card there is 1800 Member Services number Thats for you to call with questions about whats covered whats not what is my copay at a particular location Feel free to call them and ask them exactly why Prevacid is no longer covered under your Insurance I would watch the bites because spider bites can cause serious skin infections which usually require antibiotics Check the area where you sleep vacuum the area and make sure you keep windows and doors closed to prevent the spiders from coming inside You never want to take someone elses medication this is risky and not safe Antibiotics do not help with poison ivy I would recommend calling your local hospitals to see if they have a clinic or try visiting the instore clinics that are in some drugstores You can try products like Zanafel Ivy Dry and Tecnu that can help with drying up the oils causing the itching This is a great question Luckily Medicare provides a great web site for folks to check out whats covered and what isnt covered in its list of medications or formulary Check out wwwmedicaregov and click Formulary Finder 2010 Plan Data and then select your state of residence in the dropdown menu Then type in the medication you wish to learn about This actually happened to one of my family members especially as drug formularies change at certain times of the year AllegraD is comprised of two drugs fexofenadine an antihistamine and pseudoephedrine a decongestant available by prescription There are several antihistaminedecongestant combinations that are available over the counter but you need to see the pharmacist in order to purchase like ZyrtecD ClaritinD and AlavertD I recommend you talk to your pharmacist to see what one may be best for you since some may cause drowsiness and others do not Also be sure to work with your pharmacist and bring your medication list to help determine if there are any drugdrug interactions with other medications you might be taking This is a great question as patients seek alternatives to medications and health care Drug supplements are not regulated by the FDA like prescription and overthecounter medications which have to prove their safety and efficacy I generally do not recommend supplements because they are risky If you have a tooth problem and do not have insurance I recommend you check out the Health Resources and Services Administration HRSA web site for federally funded health centers near you httpfindahealthcenterhrsagov These health centers exist in urban and rural settings and provide medical care preventative care and dental care and prescription drugs for folks without insurance Payment is based on your income and what you can afford This is a common question I get at the pharmacy The first thing I ask is if they have spoken with their doctor or health care provider about this and do they know you are having a hard time paying for your medications If your conditions especially the asthma are being well controlled with the medications switching to a generic or another class of medications that has a generic may not be an optimal choice If you get switched you may end up seeing the doctor more often or have more emergency room visits which in the end drives up health care costs Many of the companies have assistance programs so you may want to look at contacting Merck and AstraZeneca who manufacture the medications you are currently on Great question No there are no overthecounter medications that help lower blood sugar If you have been diagnosed with diabetes it is important that you still try to see a health care provider for evaluation Depending on your condition you may be eligible for some classes of medications that are available generically and are lower in cost You want to make sure you do not ignore this because you can end up in the hospital if your diabetes goes untreated You are on the right track though diet exercise and lifestyle modification are important factors in helping lower blood sugar I encourage you to visit the American Diabetes Association web site at wwwdiabetesorg for more information and tips Talk to your pharmacist too they may be able to help you choose a more costeffective meter to test your blood sugar at home Great question Focalin XR and Metadate CD are brand medications of methylphenidate In the sibling analogy they are considered twins With Metadate CD you get both twins and with Focalin you get the stronger of the twins only If your insurance company is covering Focalin XR over Metadate your son should be OK with the switch Due to the formulation Focalin XR is more potent than Metadate and may require a lower dose Focalin XR and Medatate CD are in a different class than Adderall XR which is mixed amphetamine salts or amphetamine and dextroamphetamine Though the previous answer is right i want to notice that a few steps have been done in order for covering liposuction and other cosmetic procedures recently BAAPS British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons decided that insurance for Plastic Surgery Complications is necessary This question was sparked no doubt by the muchtalkedabout individual mandate which is a central component of the health reform law With some exceptions this provision would require all US citizens to purchase health insurance or face a penalty beginning in 2014 At 53 with an annual income of 12000 this reader would likely qualify for Medicaid Starting in 2014 states will receive additional funding from the federal government to cover the cost of extending Medicaid benefits If youre an individual making 14000 per year or a family of four earning 29000 or less 133 percent of the federal poverty level you would receive health benefits via Medicaid and avoid paying a penalty Helping the Middle Class Pay for Insurance For the middle class tax credits will be made available to help pay for health plans purchased through health insurance exchanges that will be set up by 2014 If youre an individual making 43000 or less or a family of four making less than 88000 the government will subsidize your insurance premiums You may also be eligible for reduced copayments coinsurance and deductibles to assist with the cost of coverage But if you fail to obtain insurance you will be penalized Heres how it breaks down Starting in 2014 the tax penalty will be 95 and that amount will gradually increase to the greater of 695 per year for individuals 2085 per family or 25 percent of a households income There will be exemptions for financial hardship The Individual Mandate  A Little Background The individual mandate was included in the new law as a way of paying for an additional 30 million uninsured Americans to have insurance by requiring everyone to pay into the system This is one the most hotly debated aspects of the new law A number of lawsuits have been filed around the country questioning whether or not it is constitutional to require Americans to purchase a product in this case health insurance Recent rulings in Michigan and Virginia upheld the new law However earlier this week a federal judge in Richmond Va ruled against it saying that the individual mandate to purchase health insurance violates the Constitution All this is to say that there will be many legal battles between now and 2014 when this mandate is scheduled to take effect Ultimately the decision as to whether its legal for the government to require people to purchase health insurance will likely fall to the Supreme Court Figuring out which insurance plan will best meet your health needs for the coming year is far from simple If you get your insurance through an employer youll likely be given a few plan options from which to choose If you buy insurance in the private market you can search for plans available in your area and compare the benefits sidebyside at either Healthcaregov or eHealthInsurancecom When evaluating each plan take the following factors into consideration Do the math Estimating what your outofpocket costs will be over the course of the next year is one of the most important considerations when choosing a health plan That means calculating the cost of items such as expected deductibles copays coinsurance and prescriptions Once youve added the numbers ask yourself Is it cheaper to purchase a high deductible plan with a lower monthly premium that costs me more before benefits kick in Or do I see a doctor frequently enough to make it worth my while to pay more each month for a plan that covers costs right away for each doctor visit or treatment Also factor in your worstcase scenario What will your maximum financial exposure be if you get sick and need serious medical care Most insurers offer planmodeling tools on their web site to help you factor in how many times you typically see a doctor during the year how many prescriptions you take and whether youre planning a surgery to help you figure out what your total outofpocket costs might be and which plan options might best serve you Review covered services If youre planning to become pregnant and your plan doesnt cover maternity care a common situation in the private market youll be left with a hefty bill upon babys arrival Carefully check out the list of excluded benefits in the healthplan summary If in doubt call the insurance company directly to confirm that the type of care and services you require are covered under the plan youre considering Provider networks and drug formularies Is your doctor in the network Are the three medications you take each month listed in the health plans formulary If not youre in for sticker shock Provider network and drug formulary information should be listed in the summary plan description or you can check the insurers web site for that information If youre searching for insurance on your own eHealthInsurancecom offers an option whereby you can type in your doctors name to see if she or he is in a health plans network You might also want to call your doctors directly to confirm participation Heres the new reality Were all paying more for fewer health benefits A 2010 employer health benefits survey conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that employees paid 14 more for family health coverage last year than just one year before And an online survey just out from Glassdoorcom found that cuts to health and dental benefits were on the rise during the last quarter of 2010 with more than 11 of employees surveyed seeing their benefits reduced in the past six months Whats driving costs skyward Experts cite a mix of inefficiencies within the healthcare system a growing use of medical technology an aging population widespread chronic disease medical malpractice and rising prescription drug costs All this has prompted many people to ask How can I save money on my health care Here a few costsaving tips to consider Negotiate Ask your doctor hospital or lab upfront how much your care will cost and then ask for a better price To find out whats reasonable for the type of care you need you can use online tools such as Healthcare Blue Book and Vimo Be sure to ask your provider for the CPT code Common Procedural Terminology that corresponds to the service you need so you can be sure youre getting an accurate comparison Some large insurers also make costs of care available to their members online If the procedure you want or need isnt covered by your insurance plan or you have no insurance ask for the same rate the provider would give an insurance company And make sure you get the agreedupon rate in writing Most providers have their billing done by a billing company You may need to show proof of your agreement to billing staff who didnt get the message from the doctor Pay cash Doctors like everyone else prefer to be paid right away for the services they provide Offering to pay in cash for your treatment prevents your doctor or hospital from having to bill you or wait for full payment That convenience can put you in a stronger position to negotiate a better price on your care Watch your location Youll pay more for the same lab work done at a hospital than you would if you had your blood drawn at a freestanding lab or your doctors office Talk with your doctor about alternative and less expensive sites for treatment Review your bills As Ive talked about before  a large percentage of medical bills contain inaccuracies Always check for duplicate or inappropriate charges before you pay any bills Save on prescription drugs Be sure to shop for the best price on your medications because costs vary widely among different pharmacies You can compare drug prices sidebyside among many pharmacies at both PlanPrescribercom and Pharmacycheckercom The National Association of Boards of Pharmacy offers listings of online pharmacies it has accredited A denied claim or refusal to pay for a medical care is among the most common reasons people call their insurance companies If youve ever had to make that call you know that doing so can feel like an exercise in futility  Marty Rosen executive vice president and cofounder of Health Advocate a health care advocacy and assistance organization  offers five tips for a successful telephone call with your health insurer 1 Know your benefits The easiest discussion with your insurance company is the one you dont have to have Avoid problems in the first place by making sure you understand your benefit plan the services youre eligible for and the rules you must follow in order to have your care paid for Do you need preauthorization from your insurer to see your doctor Find out before scheduling an appointment Take action Martin suggests keeping your Summary of Benefits  the document that outlines the details of your benefit plan  on hand when its time to schedule medical care Its a fundamental piece to have available and to understand because that sets the framework for how things will be decided Rosen says 2 Keep good records Insurance companies are typically large corporations with many departments in offices across the United States Efforts to transfer or maintain important documents proving youre entitled to a benefit or have already paid for a service arent always successful Take action Save all documents sent to you by your insurer doctors hospitals and other healthcare providers think explanations of benefits EOBs bills proof of payments etc and have them in front of you when calling your insurance company And never send your only copy to your insurer 3 Take good notes Any conversation you have with your insurer should be well documented Take action Come up with a system and keep a log Rosen advises Take careful notes about the people you speak with their names the date and what they tell you Its also a good idea to get in the habit Rosen advises of marking down the dates of your doctor visits whether and how you paid the bill These are the kind of details that can save you when a dispute over payment arises 4 Just the facts Customer service representatives need to know the salient facts of your situation if theyre to help you The more articulate and organized you are the better response youll get Take action Before your call pull together and write down the three main points you need to get across Then stick to the script 5 Take it to the top If three calls to your insurer about the same problem leave you with three different answers as to how to resolve your problem its time to climb the company ladder Customer service representatives have limited authority and their knowledge of each plans details and regulations are too often lacking Take action Ask for a supervisor or executivelevel company employee Your request may meet with resistance but keep pushing They are given a script Rosen says of the customer service people at insurance companies When they say there is no one else to talk to thats absolute nonsense If youre being stonewalled file a formal appeal with your insurer You may also be eligible for an external appeal with an independent reviewer in cases where your insurer wont budge Check with your state insurance department for details You can also enlist the help of billing advocates who can be found through organizations such as Medical Billing Advocates of America and Health Advocate And lowcost or free legal services are available in every state Check the nonprofit LawHelporg for resources Doctors and hospitals that contract with an insurance company are legally bound to accept the rate of pay stated in the contract If a healthcare provider who is innetwork with your insurance company bills you for additional payment because they werent paid as much as they wanted thats balance billing and thats not allowed Unfortunately though the practice happens all too often Its worth noting that balance billing has been an especially big problem for patients who had no choice but to seek emergency care at a hospital not participating with their insurer As a provision of the health reform law new health plans starting on or after September 23 2010 cannot charge you more for emergency services if you end up in an ER that is out of your insurers network Fighting back If your healthcare provider is contracted with your insurance company confirm that the doctor or hospital is in fact innetwork and you are being asked to pay the difference between what the provider wants to charge and what heshe is contracted to receive from your insurer fight back Heres how Complain As a first step file a grievance with your insurance company In addition to helping you fight the bills this step will protect you from being sued and reported to a credit agency Either check your Summary of Benefits or call the member services number on the back of your insurance card to ask how to initiate the appeal If you get insurance through work you can also ask your human resources department for help Bring in the authorities What if complaining to your insurer doesnt work If you dont get satisfaction you can go to regulators like the Department of Managed Health Care or Department of Insurance says Anthony Wright executive director for Health Access a California state health care consumer advocacy coalition An investigation of your case will be conducted once you file an official complaint Get expert help If going through all other channels doesnt bring relief you can find lowcost or free legal services in the state where you live at LawHelporg You can also enlist the help of billing advocates which can be found through organizations such as Medical Billing Advocates of America and Health Advocate If you have an existing medical condition such as diabetes heart disease or cancer and dont get health insurance through either your or your spouses employer theres a good chance youre uninsured The private insurance market is notorious for shutting out people with preexisting health conditions Under health reform however you have new options In July 2010 federally funded highrisk insurance pools or the PreExisting Condition Insurance Plans PCIP were set up to extend coverage for the medically uninsurable The plans are intended to function as a bridge until 2014 when insurers can no longer deny coverage even to those who are sick High Hopes Given the trouble people with health conditions have accessing insurance the central issue around which the healthreform law was formed the expectation was that the highrisk health plans would be flooded with applicants That didnt happen In fact enrollment has been extremely low as of November 2010 only about 8000 people had enrolled The numbers are growing ever so slightly however Kathleen Sebelius secretary of the department of Health and Human Services HHS recently reported that 10000 people are now enrolled in PCIP plans In part credit is being given to efforts by state and federal governments to better advertise the existence of these plans If you have a preexisting health condition and dont know about or have yet to look into the PCIPs heres your call to action HighRisk Plan Details To qualify for a PCIP plan you must be without health insurance coverage for at least six months You also have to demonstrate that youve applied for and been denied coverage on the private insurance market or were offered a plan that was unreasonably expensive The program covers primary and specialty care hospitalization and prescription drugs Preventive care is also covered at 100 and you wont be charged more because of your condition At the start of 2011 HHS threw in some new plan options You can choose among three  Standard Plan  Extended Plan  HSA Plan a taxexempt Health Savings Account where you can deposit money to use for medical expenses To review general differences in deductibles and in and outofnetwork costs among the three plans check out httpswwwpcipgovPCIP20pamphletbenefitssummarypdf Signing Up PCIP is available in all states although the programs vary Some are run by states while others are being administered by the federal Department of Health and Human Services Check the governments web site httpswwwpcipgovStatePlanshtml for details by clicking on your state in a map of the country Youll be linked to a page with specific information about the highrisk plan where you live And heres where you can apply either online or by printing and filling out an application httpswwwpcipgovApplyhtml  Monthly premium costs will be based on your age and where you live but the website will also give you a general guide as to the cost in your state Take Another Look If youve looked into a highrisk plan before but decided against applying based on expense take another look This year HHS slashed the federally run plans by about 20 in order to entice more folks to join It depends on the doctors relationship with the insurance company says Richard E Ungar a Los Angelesbased healthcare attorney That relationship can make the difference between balance billing not allowed and billing you for a balance you owe completely kosher Is Your Doc In Or Out A healthcare provider who is innetwork with your insurance company has negotiated a price for his or her medical services and signed a contract with your insurer agreeing to those rates as payment infull With the exception of your copay deductible or coinsurance innetwork providers generally cannot charge you more for their services Doing so is considered balance billing whether or not youve signed a form stating youll pay the balance of what your insurer wont But thats not the end of the story There are scenarios in which you may be required to pay beyond what your insurance company will even if the doctor is in your carriers network Duped by Details There are details consumers commonly overlook about the rules of their insurance coverage that cause trouble says Marty Rosen executive vice president and cofounder of Health Advocate a healthcare advocacy and assistance organization Forgetting the common requirement to precertify services before receiving care is a frequent mistake Another is not confirming ahead of time whether youre being treated by doctors in your insurance carriers network Failure to do so may result in denial of coverage by your insurance company and thus large outofpocket fees Rosen says Also watch for certain elements of a doctors visit that your insurance coverage may not cover Ungar warns For example lets say you see an innetwork doctor for a routine colonoscopy Both the doctor visit and the procedure may be fully covered by your insurer But if your doctor decides to use a newer sedative that requires an anesthesiologist to administer it as opposed to doing it herself Unger says you could be on the hook for the anesthesiologists charges In order to avoid unnecessary health care costs before you get care  Make sure the service you need is covered  Determine exactly what the contracted service includes  Confirm that the doctor is in your network And dont sign any documents you dont understand or dont feel comfortable with  Your first step is to request an internal review of the decision you want overturned by your health plan Your insurer should send you instructions explaining how to do this and the deadlines youll have to meet It must also send you a notice once it has reached a final decision and include an explanation of the outcome Here are some documents youll want to start collecting in order to initiate the appeal Your insurance plan or group number andor Social Security number Your doctors name and the bill for the services in question Description of the service you want covered and why Explanation of Benefits EOB forms Copy of the health plan booklet section that describes coverage related to treatment Copies of the medical records that relate to the service or treatment in question External Review If youre not satisfied with your insurance companys ruling you have the right to an external review which is conducted by an independent third party often your state insurance department Your health plan should include information about how to file an external appeal in the notice it sends you If you havent gotten the information and get your insurance at work talk with your human resources department to ask for help You can also contact the US Department of Labors Employee Benefits Advisors 8664443272 Your states insurance commissioners office is a great place to go for help too many are setting up consumer assistance programs that work with consumers on health insurance appeals For more detailed information about appeals processes under the law see  Your Right to Appeal  on the nonprofit Families USA website The simple answer unfortunately is no The provision of the health reform law that started last September applies to insurance plans that exist or are newly purchased grandfathered plans are exempt The benefit does not extend to people without insurance Unfortunately those currently uninsured wont reap the benefits of this provision until 2014 when preventive services will be free under any health plan sold through

health plan but many do And some colleges require students to prove they have some form of health insurance If youre a college student or the parent of one student health plans may offer an affordable

You can appeal if your insurer Denied payment for your care Ruled that your care was not medically necessary Said that youre not eligible for the benefit in question Claimed that your treatment is experimental Claimed that you have a preexisting condition when your plan does not cover them By law your insurer must review your appeal and make a determination within certain timelines 72 hours for denials of urgent care 30 days for denials of nonurgent care you have not yet received 60 days for denials of service you have already received If your insurance company has been paying for your care and made a recent decision to stop its always worth asking that it continue paying for your treatment until a determination on your appeal has been made PCIPs which went into effect last July were set up to extend coverage for the medically uninsurable The plans  which cover primary and specialty care hospitalization prescription drugs and preventive care at 100  are intended to function as a bridge until 2014 when insurers can no longer deny coverage even to those who are sick Here is whats different about these plans Looser requirements The requirement that you must demonstrate that youve been denied by insurers before applying has been lifted Thats a big deal and saves both time and money for people interested in applying Lower cost The federal government runs the PCIP program

mention that this is a pension plan which suggests this is retiree health insurance from a former employer If thats the case then you and your family would be eligible for subsidies as long as your income qualifies you If thats not the case and coverage for your family costs more than 8 of your household income youll be exempt from the individual mandate and wont have to pay a tax penalty Thats a good thing but you probably prefer not to leave your family uninsured Its worth working with an insurance agent to see how you can break the family up with regard to finding coverage in a way that may prove more affordable For example even without a tax credit individual plans just for the kids can likely be purchased at a fairly low rate either on or off the Marketplace Or if your income is low enough your kids could qualify for the Childrens Health Insurance Program CHIP or Medicaid Look for patient assistance programs NeedyMedsorg has information on thousands of programs more than

health conditions can no longer be denied by insurers I cant respond to the medical issue but you can go to a local urgent care center to get care if youre uninsured The key to whether youll be able

to take your health into consideration That means you cannot be denied coverage for a preexisting health condition or prior treatments You also cannot be charged more for a health plan based on the state of your health When reporting your income to apply for insurance youll be asked to project what you expect to earn in 2014 If you know your alimony is ending soon simply factor that into your calculation  Whether or not an insurer pay for a procedure depends on whether its considered medically necessary If the procedure is needed to repair or preserve the healthy functioning of the body its likely to be medically necessary Although breast implants in most cases are not covered by insurance its possible that a ruptured implant could present a medical issue that insurance would cover Contact your insurance company to find out what your policy is likely to cover And I would quickly consult with your physician to learn what needs to be done and see if you can get his or her help in justifying the need for insurance coverage to fix it Under the health reform law a small business health insurance exchange has been set up where you can shop for insurance if you wish to provide coverage for your employees In Texas you would access that through Healthcaregov Small firms in which workers have lower incomes can qualify for tax subsidies to help cover the cost If you have Medicare coverage you are not required to take any additional steps to obtain insurance coverage Medicare is considered qualified insurance coverage under the law If the insurance youre offered by your husbands work is considered affordable you can shop for a plan through Marketplaces set up under Obamacare but you wont qualify for a tax credit to help lower the cost of your coverage Youll need to check directly with your insurance company to learn how it has chosen to proceed Your daughter does not need to buy new insurance She can either stay on your plan and make no change or choose instead to be covered by her employers plan You may be able to continue getting assistance with your medications The law wont stop prescription drug programs You can seek care at a communitybased health clinic They offer medical services on a sliding scale You can find a clinic by searching the US Health Resources and Services Administration website wwwfindahealthcenterhrsagovSearchHCCaspx It is possible that insurers will cover medications for offlabel use Medicare for example has expanded its coverage of offlabel drug use of cancer drugs Generally you would need to provide a compelling medical reason for the need backed by some scientific evidence of the drugs effectiveness and a lack of other treatment options Always check with your insurer about its rules for gaining approval for medications And in such cases you would definitely need the participation of your doctor who will need to write a letter explaining your condition and why the medication in question is required As far as finding information about medications being used for ailments other than those for which theyve obtained FDA approval you might try ClinicalTrialsgov a clearinghouse of clinical trials maintained by the National Institutes of Health You can also search medical journal articles that support the treatments use by searching PubMed a service of the US National Library of Medicine at wwwpubmedgov There are a few ways you can look into getting your dental needs taken care of at a lower cost Under federal law known as HIPAA Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act you have the right to access records documenting your health conditions diagnoses and treatments Put your request in writing and send it to the doctors office There are state laws that dictate the timelines within which they must send you your records be aware that you may have to pay for the cost of copying the records You might try seeking help at a communitybased health clinic The services available vary but generally they include primary health care dental mental health and pharmacy services There are about 1200 health centers operating around the country and fees are on a sliding scale based on income You can find a clinic by searching the US Health Resources and Services Administration website People with workbased insurance thats considered affordable under the law wont qualify for subsidies if they instead of taking their employers coverage buy a policy through the exchange but that doesnt apply to Medicaid It was only last summer that the law changed so that Medicare can recognize eligibility for samesex spouses Its entirely possible that its going to take some time for the understanding of this change to make its way through the ranks Its not that the hospital is forbidden to accept children because of the Affordable Care Act The issue is that none of the insurance companies in your area have contracted with the hospital to provide care to members with your health plan Life insurance is a very different type of product than health insurance and its not my area of expertise The only real way to know is to ask However if your employer tells you it is eliminating insurance because of the law I would be wary of the answer In fact the law requires all employers with 50 or more workers to either offer health insurance coverage or to pay a penalty for failing to do so Theyll also pay a penalty if at least one fulltime employee receives a subsidy to help buy insurance through one of the new marketplaces Today 98 of employers with more than 200 workers already offer health insurance as do 94 of businesses with 50 to 199 employees And theyve providing insurance long before the ACA became law for a host of good reasons the law doesnt change For one providing insurance is a taxfree form of compensation And a good benefits package helps employers compete for employees We have heard of some small employers holding off on hiring for fear of crossing the 50employee threshold  it could certainly raise an employers costs if they currently employ fewer than 50 workers and dont offer insurance And some industries with parttime or contract workers are also reducing hours to avoid raising insurance costs because the law requires large employers to insure workers who put in on average 30 hours per week But for small companies the law in many cases increases health plan choices and for very small companies provides tax credits that can lower insurance costs I would need to know more about your particular employers situation but on the face of it it doesnt seem eliminating insurance if its already being offered makes sense because of the health reform law Even before the ACA most insurance companies allowed for one physical exam annually at no additional cost While a physical for men isnt specified under the ACA most of the screenings that take place during an exam are You can see the list of preventive services required to be provided to you with no additional costs at the time of the visit at Healthcaregov Heres the exact link httpswwwhealthcaregovwhataremypreventivecarebenefitspart1 You have a few options you can explore The Affordable Care Act will not have an impact on longterm care insurance products That means a preexisting medical condition can still impact your ability to purchase a longterm care plan Im sorry to hear about your situation The employer shared responsibility provision in the law has not yet taken effect  its been delayed For that reason your employer likely has the right to offer you a different level of benefit than those working 40hour work weeks Income changes can move you from a Medicaid plan back to an exchange health plan midyear Some states are making special provisions for this back and forth to minimize service disruptions But your costs will definitely go up if your income increases I suggest you work with a navigator in your state to carefully select your plan Youll get a better idea whats available in your state and can get help picking a Medicaid plan so that if your income increases you dont have to switch doctors Everyone will qualify for coverage Perhaps youre referring to subsidies that can lower the cost of coverage Thats based on income Its not clear from your question exactly what your situation is It may very well be that you wont find a health plan you can afford especially if you dont qualify for a subsidy However I would highly recommend you speak with a licensed insurance agent in your area for help before the deadline Starting October 1 you can head to your states health insurance marketplace where youll be able to compare health plans sidebyside and also learn if you qualify for a tax credit that will lower the cost of your premium If you buy a health plan this fall it will take effect January 1 2014 Whether or not health plans sold through the state health insurance marketplaces cover bariatric surgery will depend on the state  some will and some wont You can see whats happening where you live on the WebMD Health Reform  There you may find specific information about what health plans will be required to cover Cosmetic procedures can be deemed medically necessary though in most cases theyre not Sometimes surgery to remove excess skin after a large weight loss is a covered benefit Its hard to imagine however that liposuction would meet criteria In order for it to be covered your doctor would need to provide a medical justification for the procedure and then youd need with your insurer to see if it meets with requirements Your wife should apply for coverage through your states Marketplace for herself Although its fine for just one of you to buy an insurance plan you dont need to select a family plan

annual and lifetime payouts Youre only guaranteed a Medigap plan within the first six months of becoming eligible for Medicare After that insurers can take the state of your health into consideration

so sorry to hear about your father and for your loss You need to first check to see if the medication is on your formulary or list of drugs your insurer does cover Even if it is however insurers can

chronic illnesses need including outpatient and inpatient care prescription drugs and laboratory services The US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration SAMHSA offers a mental health

one of the prescriptions as long as it isnt at all connected with your insurance plan But its always best to check with your insurance policy to confirm the specific rules of your plan If you buy an insurance plan on the private market today youll spend extra for maternity coverage as you found out Most plans on the private market do not include maternity so gaining that coverage requires that

total household income I cant respond to your employers responsibility for covering costs you incur for care as a result of becoming sick on the job When it comes to an insurers decision to pay for any procedure the main issue is always whether its considered medically necessary While breast augmentation for the sake of vanity is not a covered service generally if a procedure is necessary to repair or preserve the healthy functioning of the body its likely to be medically necessary The law doesnt change the rules about people under the age of 65 covered by Medicare being able to buy Medigap plans Plans arent required by federal law to sell these plans to people under the age of 65 though some states allow it It sounds like youve already checked and live in a state that does not require it but you can inquire further at Medicaregov In order for an insurer to cover the cost of a treatment or medication there needs to be a medical need for it If you cant demonstrate the medical necessity for the B12 shots most companies wont pay for them Medicare counts as qualifying insurance coverage and once youre eligible you wont need any additional insurance You should qualify for a

medications First off congratulations on your weight loss I think you have a couple of choices right now You can focus on maintaining your weight with healthy habits instead of losing as you deal with your back issues and surgery In order to lose weight you will need to lower the calories you take in to make up for the lack of activity Its best to do this with professional help such as a registered dietitian or through a medically supervised program I dont know how much weight you have to lose the calories youve been taking in or the state of your health which are all factors to take under consideration I think the first choice makes the most sense because lowering your calories without exercise can slow down your metabolism You can also see a physical therapist to get ideas for exercises you can do I encourage you not to go back to old eating habits and use this as an opportunity to live a healthy lifestyle without focusing on weight You may be tempted to eat because of your situation but if you can maintain your weight and learn how to deal with stress in a healthy way that is true success And just because you are not losing weight now doesnt mean you wont be able to in the future Good luck The main way we first determine how far along a woman is in her pregnancy is by her period Further along in the pregnancy we can use other indicators including ultrasound At this

Licensed professionals including psychologists have an ethical responsibility to take a number of probono cases This means for little or no fee Of course there is a limit to the number of these cases that anyone can take but its worth asking You can call your local psychologists association explain your situation and ask for the names of psychologists in your area who would be willing to help you You can also check social service agencies as well as any major hospital center because these entities generally have access to mentalhealth providers who require minimal fees Check the amount of caffeine you are taking in Coffee tea ice tea soda in large amounts can cause this I experienced the same thing during the summer when my intake of iced tea increased When I switched to caffeine free tea the palpitations went away need help for vestibular disorder Hospitals are contracted with insurance companys Hospitals can charge whatever they want BUT insurances tell the hospital per contract what the hospital is allowed to charge Then the hospital does the contractual adjustment and writes off the difference IE Bx costs 20000 Insurance says no contracted rate is 4000 Hospital writes off 16000 and bills insurance the 4000 Every insurance has a contracted rate for the procedure Again the insurance tells the hospital what its allowed to charge One insurance says hospital can bill 4000 another says contracted rate is 5000 another says contracted rate is 3000 So it all really depends on what insurance policy you have and what your insurance states the hospital can charge it must be because of gastric in your body due to stress or not getting proper sleep be sure that you have the medical insurance also Talk to someone who is in charge at the insurance company If you dont have the money they are not going to get anything unless they sued you You are willing to work out a payment plan and I think they would be fools not to accept your offer Dont take the first No for an answer I suggest that you find the name of the headhonchothe supervisorand direct a letter to them with your proposal This is an expensive lesson on the importance of not missing payments I am not sure what kind of scans your chiropractor wants you to get but there is really nothing in any malpractice law that requires imaging studies You can ask him to see a copy of this law in writing but I dont think there is one I dont really no your case but scans may offer a clinician valuable informationat a cost of course Some MRIs can cost a thousand dollars or more so you do have to be financially responsible Consider getting a second opinion from an orthopedic specialist  one that is covered by your insurance  to see if a scan is necessary Insurance or not making an accurate diagnosis is required BEFORE a treatment plan is determined I know this injury is untimely but these things happen If your car broke down your car insurance wouldnt fix ityou would have to come up with the money to do it The same deal goes with your husband Borrow moneycharge the visit to a credit cardhave the facility bill you and pay latereither way the evaluation needs to be done FIRST There is absolutely no way for me or any medical professional to be able to tell you the reason for his side pain since we dont even know which side or the location on that side Without knowing his medical history I couldnt even recommend ibuprofen Get him the care he needsworry about paying for it later An urgent care facility is a fraction of the cost of an ER so this is what I suggest Most even have their own xrays A cheap quick test for what Unfortunately when you have the array of medical problems that you have listed there are no cheap quick tests for anythingwhether you have insurance or not You need to be under medical care so that you can have your headache evaluated your blood pressure monitored your congestive heart failure managed and vision disorder checked These are not things you can do over the counter so it would be in your best interest to find some affordable care That is a question that only your dentist can answer Waiting a year being toothless is not something that anyone would want to do I really have no idea if you can wait a yearsome medical and dental problems precede our insurance You couldnt wait a year with appendicitis so you may not be able to wait a year before you have the proper insurance Ask the podiatrist No one can really address this question than the medical professional that made this decision I agree that a full leg air cast is a bit excessive so he will need to offer you a reasonable explanation A physical exam required for an ID I find that odd but you will need to call around an ask Costs very widely so start with Urgent Care facilities You may even find a lowincome clinic in your area An exam can range from 50 to hundreds depending on your geographic area and the extent of the physical that is required There are NO SET FEES Medicare is ALWAYS your primary I dont believe you have a choice Insurance or not there is very little that can be accomplished over the Internet in the way of diagnosis or treatment Unless a medical provider can examine your daughter firsthand it would not be possible to confirm or dispute her original diagnosis let alone effectively treat her The diagnosis of gout would require a blood test as well as evaluating her challenged immune system As you know this cannot be done online The most expensive care in the US is at an emergency room What she may have is not considered an emergency so she would be better off finding a free clinic or one that charges on a sliding scale Or you can spend some time so she can get insurance like Obamacare ACA I would not recommend her using flea and tick spray for dogs I have no way of confirming or disputing this chiropractors diagnosis but I do have issues with the treatment plan Degeneration by definition is wear and tear often due to aging I dont believe it is possible to reverse aging by chiropractic adjustments but then again I am not a chiropractor who believes in those things Before mortgaging your house see an orthopedist for a medical opinion and have some imaging studies read by a radiologist I think you will find a different perspective on your neck and low back issues It can be very difficult for a person who is addicted to opiates to stopthis is why it is called an addiction Personally I feel that it would be best for you to enter a drug detoxification program Most insurance companies DO pay for this but you have to get a referral from your primary care provider Many areas also have drug programs that are free so do your homework and get the help that you are requesting and desperately need Noas a matter of fact antibiotics like Amoxicillin can CAUSE a vaginal yeast infection Because of the odor uncommon in yeastcandidiasis I suspect you have a bacterial infection but that is just a guess If you do amoxicillin is not the antibiotic that would be used Insurance or not you need proper medical care Insurance or not your husband cannot be accurately diagnosed or treated blindly over the Internet A picture is not going to do it He will need to pay for a medical visit I would suggest that he goes to a lessexpensive urgent care facility or find a freeclinic Sore throats can be caused by MANY thingsviral infections bacterial infections like Strep mono post nasal drainage from sinusitis breathing through your mouth when your nose is clogged cigarettes allergyLOTS of things Can it last two weeks You bet It is possible for me or any medical provider to be able to determine a specific cause or a treatment over the Internet No Insurance or financial constraint or not the ONLY way you can be properly diagnosed and treated is to SEE a medical provider I know medical care is pricey but so is gasoline car repairs plumbers and just about anything else Sometimes you just have to allocate some of your limited resources to YOURSELF Ask several local pharmacists for recommendations for the best internist  one that they would see I bet you will get the same name over and over again When it comes to inexpensive pharmaceuticals you may need to call around to various pharmacies and even Planned Parenthood and ask prices I dont think you will find that much variation in price Since this is over the counter insurance may not cover it anyway even if you had it Remember that this is the morning after pill so you dont have that much time to comparison shop I can assure you that if you are hoping to prevent a pregnancy as a result of unprotected sex the consequences of not doing this promptly is going to be a lot more expensive if you know what I mean This method may be pricey if you are on a tight budget but it is too late to use condoms now They would have been less expensive so lesson learned Dont wait You need to go to the ER again Black tarry smelly stools usually indicate a gastrointestinal bleed stomach esophagus etc that can be lifethreatening GO NOW I dont know what tests will be required but many insurance companies do require urine and blood tests Some will require a drug screen not just for illegal drugs but for other medications There are no routine tests  Every insurance company is different so you do have the right to know what they will require Those birth control pills are most likely identical The pharmacy may have acquired them from a different generic company and that is all they carry now The pharmacist should explain that to you You can contact your medical provider but I suspect that the pills are the same Different generic names but the same identical ingredients This is called  a common complication of your circumcision The ONLY way to fix this is to have it surgically corrected not something you can do at home Steroid creams often help with simple adhesions but not bridging So as soon as you get insurance go see a urologist and have it fixed permanently In most cases it is a simple office procedure under local anesthesia Push the insurance company Do NOT take no as the first answer and ask to talk to the medical director or better yet have your physician request an exemption to the rule A friend of mine wanted a colonoscopy early because her grandmother had colon cancer They refused at first only offering a sigmoidoscopy a cheaper and less thorough exam They finally okayed the colonoscopy and a precancerous lesion was found in a place where the sigmoidoscopy would not have discovered Had she waited several more years like the insurance company wanted she would have definitely had colon cancer by that time Fight em I cant answer that question since I would need to know what it actually was I cannot make a blind guess and determine if it will go away I am very sorry There are MANY things that cause intrascotal masses A brief description of the size and location does not really substitute for a thorough examination I realize that money may be tight and that you do not have insurance but there are really no alternatives You will need to make a decision based on how concerned you are about this new finding Give your husband the same consideration as your automobile If your car was causing problems or making a strange noise you would get it checked out before it became worse That depends on many thingsthe reason your need in vitro the benefits of your particular insurance the results of your fertility studies your age etc Talk to your gynecologist first followed by your insurance company You dont have insurance and I cant see them over the Internet so we have a dilemma The only way that you can get an accurate diagnosis is for him to see a medical provider or dermatologist but your guess is very good These may indeed be molluscum contagiosum  very common childhood skin eruption If you didnt see the dent in the middle called an umbilication look closer with a magnifying glass It may be there I dont know the details of your casewhy you have been on narcotics for a long timebut perhaps it is time for you to see a new pain specialist Yes you can get pregnant That is why the Implanon has an expiration datethe point where the hormone has depleted This may be why your period is not normal Use a secondary form of birth control like a condom or you will be just taking chances I recently had emergency medical care in Austria It was my responsibility to pay the bill I do have US insurance but have yet to receive reimbursement In your Aunts case with emergency surgery she may be considered among the multitude of uninsured I am pleased that we live in a country where someonea visitorwithout insurance or the means to pay can get professional care that may be lifesaving I dont believe that her sponsors are financially responsible but I am not an attorney I would suggest that she speak with the billing department of the hospital for some advice and assistance in this matter Since she is not a US citizen and a taxpayer I cant imagine that she would be qualified for Medicare after the fact but hospitals often have creative financial solutions The good news is that your Aunt received care A serum ferritin level is a blood test It is not very expensive There are no other ways to determine this level Yes a healthy immune system assuming you have one will handle Strep throat The reason why we try and detect and treat Strep is to prevent the possible COMPLICATIONS of Strep namely heart or kidney disease I suspect that most people have had Strep in their lifetime only to have it resolve spontaneously but that does not mean you should not seek medical care if you have any of the signs of Strep bright red dotted throat fever etc If you do have Strep and you are one of those rare people that develop a complication money will be the least of your problems While medical care is expensive just like getting your car repaired you still have to open that wallet sometimes and take care of yourself if you dont have insurance No there is nothing over the counter that will really help genital herpes Sorry Unfortunately you may need to wait until June It would not be possible to determine the reason why you have never had a menstrual cycle over the Internet The causes are many and we do not know anything about your medical history or have any way of examining you And yes PCOS can be one of the causes to consider A workup may be expensive so waiting until June would be prudent As much as I would like to address your concerns I really do not know anything about youyour age medical history or even if you are a female men have breasts too More importantly it would take a thorough examination to determine if this lump is worrisome or not Although I am sympathetic to your lack of insurance an examination is really the only way to make this important call I can tell you that lumps that come and go are more likely to be cysts especially if the lumps are influenced by your menstrual cycle again assuming you are female Breast cancers do not come and gosadly they tend to stay and get bigger over time Urologist There are no good ballpark figures so my suggestion for you is to call several podiatrists in your area and get the price Many will offer cash discounts to patients without insurance It would be unusual to get out of any doctors appointment anymore for 100 to 150 but of course procedures may cost a bit more This may be a ganglion cyst  No a free clinic will not treat it and neither will the emergency room You will need to see a hand surgeon once you have insurance or the financial resources to pay for a visit and the procedure expensive This is a cyst on a nerve so only an expert should be attempting to remove it Simply aspirating it with a needle some medical providers do this is unlikely to orchestrate a permanent cureit will come back Slamming it with a book my Aunt claimed the book had to be a Bible is painful and unlikely to solve your problem You can just leave it be for now and wait until you have insurance Yes of course You can always buy health insurance on the open marketplace See an insurance broker and choose the plan that you want and can afford Beckkss08 what ended up happening I had a period that lasted for 12 days that started on July 26th Its now September 8th and I have not had another period  There are several options If you have a local dental school a hospitalbased program or a free dental clinic in the area they can help you I would suggest calling the local dental society for advice on what to do Remember that most private practice dentists offer some type of financing as well Ask your local dentist what the best option is for you I have found that Neosporin makes anti itch cream daily moisturizing cream and body wash for eczema It is called Neosporin Eczema Essentials I use the moisturizing cream on my hands and feet and it works great I found it at Walgreens but it is a little pricey but I think it is well worth the money One option to consider is a chemical peel Dermatologists that are familiar with chemical peels use a combination of salicylic acid AHA and TCA to remove the top layer of the skin and encourage new skin growth Chemical peels can be very effective and are less costly than most laser treatments The cost for eye fillers differ from region to region across the US Typical fees may range from 250 to 700 per syringe Your final decision for skin rejuvenation should not be based solely on costs You may want to contact the physician in your area and ask about their fees and payment options Insurance does not typically cover cosmetic facial enhancement procedures Other alternatives include simply getting enough rest placing a cool compress on your eyes with caffeine and reducing the level of your stress I have the same problem Itching in the same location on my back below my right shoulder blade for almost 2 years now My dermatologist said it was a form of arthritis When I told my family physician she had never heard of it I am starting to think it could be hormonal I think many priests pastors rabbis have good counseling skills Lets face it they help us through many tough times So if you cannot afford anyone else not a bad place to start They will tell you if your symptoms are way out of their league Because it is a cosmetic procedure liposuction is not covered by most health insurance plans Ask to talk with a representative at your insurance company who can explain the costs of the procedure and payment options Wait a day or two for discoloration of the foot if it turns purple red yellow its broken may have a contusion on the foot bone bruise What part of your ankle If you do not have health insurance and can not get an MRI a place I have been multiple times believe me I would suggest pulling up multiple diagrams of interior ankle anatomy and really try to pinpoint what exactly is giving you hell When I didnt have insurance I tore my meniscus in my right knee and it was very similar to your situation in terms of pain and time Never had it fixed either even after I got insurance as its a 5050 thing Bottom line IMO If you have been good for 4 years you just did something to tweak a weakness somewhere Be easy pinpoint it best you can and research further when you think you have it pegged as to what you can holistically do I try to remind myself of the fact that ancient Gladiators had no surgeons ice beds etc haha Youll figure it out Ive been taking Lamictal since I was about 8 years old so 10 years for the same reason It really helps me as long as I dont miss a dose Try not to miss any doses and it should work No matter no insurance It might be 6500 at a walk in Get the antibiotics Some are free My 2 sons have it Once you get it can always come back Please take care of it Yes other people can get it from you Have to keep the bathroom clean Bleach is maybe a 100 You can take a sodapopbeer bottle wash it out Fill half way of water and bring close to a boil Put it over the area and it will pull it out From an article on WebMD that I found If the spinal cord or nerves become squeezed \t\t symptoms may include Numbness weakness cramping or pain in the \t\t\t legs feet or buttocks These symptoms get worse when you walk stand \t\t\t straight or lean backward The pain gets better when you sit down or lean \t\t\t forward Stiffness in the legs and thighs Low back \t\t\t pain In severe cases loss of bladder and bowel control Symptoms may be severe at times and less severe at other \t\t times Most people will not be severely disabled In fact many people do not \t\t have symptoms at all From this it doesnt look like vertigo is typical but I would speak to my doctor Here is the article if you want to read more httpwwwwebmdcombackpaintclumbarspinalstenosistopicoverview It sounds infected to me I would try to get to a doctor but in the meantime I would put a topical antibiotic on it like bacitracin or something I hope it feels better soon I know this doesnt help but I think you should go to the doctor Its my understanding that this is basically an infection You might be able to save money by not having the tooth capped but its my understanding that you need to get the infection addressed Not sure if this is helpful or not but I have a friend who has GERD and this is a symptom he has I found this link that goes into more detail  but you might consider what you are eating while you are trying to figure out what this might be httpwwwwebmdcomheartburngerdguideunderstandinggerdsymptoms From what Ive read there is one that is sort of like a pimple  where you might treat it like a pimple with astrigent and some topical antibiotic and the other is more boilish but it seems like you would definitely know if you had the boil kind If you have insurance you need to have your doctor order a MRI Insurance needs to approve these due to how expensive MRIs are You may have a herniation a slipped disc or it could just be muscle spasm If over the counter pain relievers do not help you may need a painkiller or a muscle relaxer If you have no insurance go to the ER and get help There are emergency payment aids for people with no insurance I hope this helped I just saw the second half of your post sorry Go to the ER If you have no insurance there are emergency payment aids that would cost you nothing You may not get an MRI done but it sounds to me like muscle spasms Good news is that muscle relaxers are cheap Bad news is they will make you sleepy and no way you should drink on them if youre a drinker If its not spasms start asking around for good doctors who will work with your insurance situation You will make a lot of calls before you find the right one but dont give up Theyre out there I promise Understand your worries I have had 2 periods this month Had a week with no spottingstarted spotting again last night UGH I have to wait till january for my insurance to kick in I had gastritis and it made me vomit from eating made me extremely nauseas You also might have GERD You need to take prilosec and watch out for trigger foods supplement with rose hips oilpills ginger tea dong quai rootblack cohosh herb red raspberry leaf maitake mushroomsdandelion roots goldenseal maybe make an appointment with a free clinic just for an exam also As one of member previously said light to throat and find any white or block dots if it is severe consult the doctor Have you tried the RICE methodresticingcold packs on 10mins per hrcompressing the foot wan ace bandage  elevating it wa pillow try that for a day wtaking an Advil or Tylenolif you notice any increase painswellingcolor of your footinability to put any weight on your affected leg Get to an MD quick for an Xrayevaluation IMOI think the RICE method will help you  this is most likely a sprainstrain  this is the traditional method of tx It could be that you are in a premenopause state called peri menopause Your gyn could give you a prescription for progesterone to stop it for now It usually occurs in your 40s  50s See your doc I happened to be in the same boat as you except I now know for sure I have to have fusion in my wrist which will dramatically reduce my wrists range of motion I fractured my wrist twice First time very badly in 1981 and the second time only about 2 years ago Although it was set correctly yet the second time it broke very easily because it had become suseptive to breakage due to the first severe fracture It only took one year for my wrist to develope ARTHRITIS to the extend that the only solution now is FUSION withTitanium I have very soft bones and my body is arthitis proned and any trauma to my bones especially to areas that bones connect to CATLIDGE soon develope Arthritis In your case I think for one your fracture must have been relatively severe and in an area where jointcartlidge has an imprtant and pehaps mulirange function and two it could have not been set very correctly and or your joints like mine are proned to Arthritis due trauma Physical therapy is very important after the bone heals Age certainly has someting to do with it in other words the younger one is the better and quicker the bone and cartlidge heal and thus the likelihood of development of Arthritis is less What triggers Arthritis is when cartlidges between two connecting bones ware off due to either age or trauma usually when the connecting bone to the cartlidge is repositioned off its normal or natural position which can occur with bone fracture or even after it set Do get second and third openion from expert surgeons Good luck Have you tried altering ice and heat I fell and turned my ankle in under me I spent 8 weeks on crutches with a knot on top of my foot The Doctor told me I had pulled the tendons in the top of my foot He said for me to do the ice and heat Tylenol and Ibuprofen and continue to walk on it but to walk then elevate walk and elevate Okay  first you need to understand that periods can change especially as you get older with more stress more sex ect The brown discharge is probably old blood and seeing as you said it had been 12 days that may explain why it is brown and spotting  and it can last several days after your period Pulling out is not a guarantee method of birth control not that I am saying anything else is guaranteed you maybe pregnant some women have their first period after conceiving Ovarian cyst are also maybe a possibility and any chance of toxic shock syndrome But chances are it is just an abnormal period If it continues or you start to have pain or new symptoms the only safe bet is to call your OBGYN Good luck Had this happen to me did the fussion 3 times and they all failed I am type 2 Diabetic so that could have something to do with it Get second opinions you could end up like me disabled for the rest of my life  When I went to a pain management center I was given a series of steroid injections3 and Norco Hydrocodone Receiving no relief the doc increased the dosage of pills Are you taking the maximum strength 10325mg Next I went to a different doc who took a CT scan and discovered I had Spinal Stenosis which was the cause of the pain A pain management center can not do anything for that A neurologist can address that problem Good luck Yes It is the outside area of my ankle near the ankle bone itself I have had some mild pain throughout the years but nothing like this I have been keeping it wrapped applying ice and taking a anti inflammatory Hoping it starts to feel better soon Im not a DR but when I had a severe pain behind my right ear and went to the er they said I had Bells Palsy I also had right side paralisis on my face I would suggest a Dr visit Sorry I couldnt be more helpfull A weird trick my dermatologist gave me when antibiotics failed was apple cider vinegar by applying it to acne twice a day for a couple minutes to get rid of old skin cells due to the acidic levels which replaces them with new healthier cells This personally has helped me a lot and as weird as it sounds eating nutritional foods was the other tip she told me so foods rich in vitamin a c and e help a lot but stay away from saturated and trans fats along with processed foods Also I found out on WebMD that 30100 mg of zinc a day will help decrease the oil produced by body Gives this a try as all are very inexpensive compared to the antibiotics and creams dermatologists prescribe just go to a chiropractor if youre lucky it will be easily diagnoseable The answer this so called  expert  gave is misleading The truth is that the ACA will cost small businesses more or it will cost tax payers way more Anytime the government says they give subsidies they are talking about using the taxes they collect from you and your boss to pay for it So it is a pay me now or pay me later thing This law is not suppose to work It is designed to crush privately owned insurance and collapse the healthcare system in our country They want a single payer system The same one that has failed in every country and in every way So yes it will cost you more A lot more and for less coverage Anytime an Obama spokesperson talks about how obamacare isnt working they end it with thats why we need a single payer system So take what this site says with a grain of salt They are part of healthcaregov This administration in the White House has lied from day one i had the same problem my dr ordered me an ultrasound and found out i had to get my gaullbladder removed Is the pain under your rib cage Need more details about the pain and where it is located and when it hurts no most antibiotics they give for strep are Ammoxicilian ammoxicilian clavulanateAugmentin brand name cephalexin or Keflex brand name never heard of the drug you are speaking of I know you dont have insurance but think of your health I recently thought I was having an ear infection so went to doctor but did not want to pay high medical bill so went to clinic inside Walgreens and turns out it was only a skin infection of the outer ear was given cephalexin for 10 days since I can only take liquid meds have troubles taking pills I have insurance and ended up only paying 20 for the visit and 5 for the meds You should try Take Care clinic at Walgreens or MinuteClinic at CVS their prices seem to be very reasonable without insurance my visit would have been only 89 do you have any redness in the throat or white patches in mouth this could be a symptom of strep throat my friends daughter has strep she had swollentender glands but also had rednesswhite patches in throat try Take care health at walgreens or minute clinic at CVS their prices seem to be reasonable Most services at walgreens are only 5999 I recently used walgreens for what ended up being a skin infection in the outside of my right earwhich only cost me 20 for visit and 5 for prescription since I had insurance without would have only been 89 for visit before you decide to gain weight what is your height looking at your user name im assuming your a male who weighs 140lb on average male height in north america is 6 feet and your bmi is average unless you are 6 feet 9 you are underweight or 5 feet 9 you are overweight It is because or the hair regrowing on your vaginal area You most likely sprained your ankle or stretched a tendon I have done the same thing a few times I usually wrap my ankle in an ace bandage and prop my foot up and take an antiinflammatory medication to help with swelling If your foot dosnt get better you should see a doctor have u tryed applying for ssi and medicade and telling them that is a emergency fist u need to find a gi doctor because i had that problem and couldnt swollow i have a hernia in my throat so thats what i can offer is my addivce to ugood luck It could be a number of things Since it includes difficulty to swallowing I wouldnt keep putting it off Get it checked out I dont think ENTs will bill you they will more than likely want to pay up front and that can get expensive At least the ER will bill you If it bothers you to swallow that tube is right by the tube you use to breathe Have you had a nerve test I just had surgery for ulnar nerve entrapment It was affecting my pinky and ring finger Good Luck From what I know there is only one gel for testosterone Androgel and it can be expensive Have you or your doctor considered injections of testosterone The shots have been around longer and may be more cost effective and therefore worth the bit of pain  If you are interested call your insurance to see if testosterone shots would be covered it doesnt sound too serious it sounds like an ear infectionmy glands swell when i get ear infections it may not have happened to u before but u need to remember that it is all connected I had Endometriosis before a radical Hysterectomy I remember doubling over in pain and it did affect my ability to have a bowel movement You need to be seen by a doctor right away I know you dont want to because of finances but I suggest you go anyway Did they perform a radical Hysterectomy or partial The only way you could be having problems with Endometriosis is if they performed a partial Hysterectomy I finally had to have a radical meaning they took both ovaries as well as the uterus Once this is done you cannot have Endometriosis again Sounds like a yeast infection to me Monistat 3 saved my life I couldnt sleep and was at the point of tears Experiencing those symptoms were the worst and I broke down until I asked an MA that I worked with She recommended this treatment I googled it and was TERRIFIED at the responses that it was worse to use than the actual condition itself But I buckled down and said it really cant be any worse than this I and the MA was right Nothing burned or felt worse Just relief Every day after got better and better I am finishing day 3 of monistat and I feel back to normal I am thankful I didnt pay attention to the bad reviews I feel like people come online more so to bash their bad experience with it because it didnt help them and those that it did help they dont find a need to let others know because they are over the hurdle Thats why Im posting People need to know that its not scary and that its NORMAL And extremely uncomfortable But that this product WORKS The symptoms I had were as follows paper cut feeling on the labia burning on the inside of the vagina and sleeplessness due to extreme discomfort The only thing I did differently than what the box recommended was using calmoseptine cream on the outside for the itching and burning instead of the cream in the box Calmo has a menthol release and was the only thing that helped The monistat ointment that came with the 3 was bogus and made it burn like crazy Calmo is used for a wide variety of skin issues such as this and medical professionals seem to think this okay to use for this condition to get relief I didnt consult with one before using it and it got me though the majority of my day Just remember to cleanse and reapply frequently and use less as it gets better because skin needs to breathe Good luck to you all and seek medical attention if you have a fever or any other out of the ordinary symptoms for yeast infection Other than that get to your nearest Rite Aide or other pharmacy provider and get Monistat for relief Just remember that 1 is the most potent and 7 is the least and if you are prone to more sensitivity go with the longer treatment God speed I am trying to help a friend who has been dx with ADDH and has been Rx Adderall she does not have Insurance and she was arrested because her mother takes the very same medication and she had 2 Adderall on her when she was stopped for a moving violation She was charged with position of cocaine I am trying to help her find a indigent program to help her pay for her Rx cost Its also important to remember that itching is part of a tattoos healing process Intense itching like want to scratch your arm off itching When the old skin dies and flakes off the new skin growth itches like crazy for a few days before settling down Cool showers and your tattoo aftercare ointment gently massaged into the tattoo will help but all in all the itching will pass after the tattoo is healed Allergic reaction to the ink will look more like red speckles or spots all around your tattoo unusual oozing puss or smelly discharge You will know within hours of receiving your tattoo if you are allergic to the ink Most tattoo pigments are completely organic and allergic reactions are rare  and most often to red ink Never put a first aid product or antiitch lotion onto an unhealed tattoo you will first off be in a ton of pain and subsequently ruin your tattoo  A Tattoo Artist I have been in the health insurance business for 40 years The ACA Obamacare mandated a certain level of benefits that must be included in all health plans This is identical to the what every state legislature does when it mandates what is minimum coverage for auto insurance One wants to know that if someone crashes into you that they at least have enough insurance to fix your car if not their own The exchanges are simply PRIVATE insurance companies competing for business in a marketplace They are all quoting the same benefit packages and are simply competing at price No one demanded or required them to compete for this business or offer insurance in the exchanges Some exchanges have more companies offering insurance than others These private companies are doing so because they think they can make a few bucks It is not some government conspiracy to take over the insurance business That having been said one may notice that no other industrialized nation on earth has seen fit to copy our health care system It simply has not worked and I personally see very little on the horizon to make me believe it will work in the future In fact in response to the writer who suggested more universal plans are not working and are unpopular might look only to our neighbor to the north whose health care system is quite popular with Canadian citizens I know I know Canadians are marching to the US for their health care needs This post is to short to actually address this issue but suffice to say Canadians are NOT coming in any great numbers to the US for their basic health care needs Actually when you factor out tourists from Canada who receive emergency treatment the incidence of Canadians coming to the US is actually quite small and is comprised almost exclusively of higher income individuals seeking elective surgery due to the wait in Canada for those types of services Take a look around the world and compare the healthcare systems of other advanced societies Many have found ways to both meet the needs of their citizens and do it at significantly less money than we spend For your research pleasure I would recommend looking at that downtrodden and financially irresponsible country of Switzerland as an example of how we might address this issue ion the future See the book The Healing of America A Global Quest for Better Cheaper and Fairer Health Care by TR Reid Finally yes we have the finest health care system in the world but only if you can afford it What do you mean by right side Your abdomen If so maybe you should see a specialist It could be something gastrointestinal or related to diet I fractured mine in a fall off of a ladder No surgery so far I am using a knee immobilizersupport I was told three months to heal Hurt like a bitch also tore thigh muscles and ligaments not detached I am self employed a contractor which means I must still work and stand on the leg Customers do not care whether I am injured or not I gave up on the Vicodin which makes me stupid and am using the old standby Jack Daniels as a pain killer It least it tastes good I wish you the best multiple causes including weakness in muscles and joints balance issues and vision problems including loss of depth perception  I would go to the doctors office and demand a refill because you need it and benefit from it Millions of people have had their insurance cancelled because of Obama But that should work in your favor Youre not asking for the moon They should be able to work something out for you If not I am available to go to bat for you With the bipolar meds that I take daily I am not afraid of anything hello  in the depression community httpforumswebmdcom3depressionexchangeforum6522 first and tenth posts we have a list of resources for finding freelowcost medical care including counseling take a look there for some other ideas im so sorry you are suffering such heartache  susie margaret You have to understand at two weeks the size of the foetus would NOT show on the outside of your body To give you an idea the womb gets to the height of your belly button at FIVE months Any lumps are not from any type of pregnancy I worked in a doctor office for 14 years and helped patients that can afford their meds Check with your family doctor the have a program out there called patient assistance program you might want to look on the internet for information It helped a lot of patients out there Give it a try talk to your doctor and tell her everything about this past problem and what your other doctor gave you that worked and i really think you should find out what is causing this paingood luck and God bless you I also have the same problem and I have insurance and still deal with the same thing have seen many docs and they dont give me no answers on how to stop it a along with this problem I have been gaining weight even if I only drink water it goes right through me nothing I do seems to work I have even cut down to eating 1 meal a day my husband worriers about me so for him I do eat but very small portions but does not matter how much or how little I eat or drink it still goes right through me please let me know if you find a solution to our problem all I get from the doctors is what they call a dumping serfdom The endocrinologist is probably talking about the calcium in your bones The urologist is probably talking about calcium in your blood You should clarify what the doctor says no NO Ask your doctor for something else "}
