{"text": "My Husbans was just Diagnosed with Testicular Canceron 032714 We are new at this and would need ALOT of information please please please We have 3 children our oldestbeing 26 and our middle child beind just turned 13 our Youngest is 10 and the only boy This will cruch them being that we are all very close HELP US PLEASE have u been eating a lot of salt sometimes to much salt can cause bumps on the inside of your mouth or tongue hope this helps good luck Go go a dermatologist and have the areas frozen It will remove them completely Since most vaccines are either free or relatively inexspensive I would get the shot According to the info you gave you are in a high risk so I WOULD get the vaccine It could very well be the only way to prevent getting the virus Am not sure what type of chemotherapy you will be receiving but this usually includes a platinum drug and a taxane drug A description of chemotherapy side effects can be found on the Womens Cancer Network web site This site has been developed by the Gynecologic Cancer Foundation and contains a lot of good information about ovarian cancer The average age of ovarian cancer is in the early 60s and someone who is 75 can certainly get this disease In addition to an ultrasound it is usually helpful to get a CA125 blood test This test is not perfect as it can be elevated due to other causes but it is elevated in most women with ovarian cancer An endocrinologist is usually the type physician used to coordinate the care of thyroid cancer Follicular thyroid cancer involves several different steps and an endocrinologist will be able to guide your treatment program so that at each stage you see the most appropriate consultant The first step in the treatment of suspected follicular thyroid cancer is a total or neartotal thyroidectomy This type of operation can be tricky and you want to make sure you are referred to a surgeon with a lot of experience in thyroid surgery Once the thyroid is removed the diagnosis of follicular thyroid cancer must be confirmed This type of thyroid cancer unlike the more common thyroid cancer papillary thyroid cancer cannot be accurately diagnosed by a fine needle aspiration This is the procedure when a doctor puts a needle into a thyroid nodule and draws out some cells Fine needle aspiration can only be used to diagnose a follicular tumor A follicular tumor may be either benign or cancerous A surgical specimen is required to determine that the tumor is cancerous and has the ability to spread to other sites When the diagnosis of follicular thyroid cancer is confirmed surgically and the thyroid has been removed the next step in the treatment is radioactive iodine I131 This is used to kill off any remaining thyroid cancer cells Once the thyroid has been removed and destroyed scans and blood tests can be used to check for recurrence After surgery and radioiodine ablation thyroid cancer patients are given thyroid hormone replacement to replace the hormone and prevent any thyroid growth An endocrinologist will be able to support you through this entire process Insurance companies pay for medications when a drug has received FDA approval for treatment or there are advanced clinical trials Phase III and above which show that the treatment is effective What is hard for patients and families to sometimes understand is that insurance companies only pay for proven therapies not experimental therapies This is especially hard when the disease is cancer Fortunately the National Institute of Health and drug manufacturers are very involved in clinical trials for new cancer drugs or new indications for cancer drugs Clinical trials are very important because cancer drugs are generally very toxic and expensive and we need scientific evidence to decide on the best treatment options not anecdotal successes Because each cancer patients situation is different we want to make sure that a drug works for a particular patient Not all breast cancer patients are the same Some have limited disease some have advanced disease some breast cancers occur before menopause some after and hormonal and genetic characteristics can vary from patient to patient Afinitor everolimus is FDA approved for breast cancer in combination with Aromasin exemestane for certain postmenopausal women The breast cancer must be advanced hormonereceptor positive HER2negative and in patients who experienced a recurrence or progression of their cancer after treatment with hormone therapy using Femara letrozole or Arimidex anastrozole If your sister fits in this category then her cancer doctor can write a letter to the insurance company citing her qualifications Another important avenue to pursue for cancer patients is clinical trials You can look up clinical trials on the web site httpwwwcancergovclinicaltrials by cancer type and features in your zip code or state There are several ongoing breast cancer trials using everolimus Afinitor that may be applicable to your sister Talk with her cancer doctor about clinical trials and assistance in working with the insurance company to get the best treatment for your sister A high thyroglobin antibody level in and of itself does not mean you have thyroid disease They are found in nearly 20 of all women However high levels of thyroglobulin antibodies associated with other thyroid antibodies are found in 80 to 90 of people with immune mediated inflammation of the thyroid Hashimotos thyroiditis This is the most common type of thyroid hormone deficiency in the US Thyroglobulin antibodies are also found in pregnant women relatives of patients with Hashimotos thyroiditis and in people with other immune mediated diseases such as Type 1 diabetes The usual course of Hashimotos thyroiditis is gradual loss of thyroid function Antibodies to thyroglobulin are considered to occur as a result of damage to the thyroid from special white blood cells T cells Common symptoms of thyroid hormone deficiency include fatigue being cold all the time weight gain constipation dry skin and menstrual irregularities Since these symptoms occur in other diseases it is important not to always blame thyroid deficiency as the cause Fortunately laboratory tests for thyroid function make this diagnosis relatively easy However because loss of thyroid hormone develops over time and antibodies can herald problems you will want to followup with your doctor about your thyroid tests and your symptoms get tested for a condition called nf neurofibromatosis it is tumors on the nerves it can be very painful i have it have it since the year of 12 but born with it my dad had it but do not know the year for surei live in Texas there is a foundation which can and will help you there is a lot of things they can tell if you have nf brown spots from birth learning disabilty Dallas Texas just go to nf tumors and the state you are in hope this will help you my name is liz i will help anyone who has nf learn more about it we can live with it nf is or can not be cured Annqueenliz Whether you feel these lumps may be cancerous or common I highly advise you to see your physician and accordingly the doctor may or may not order additional testss However If the lump is painful and can be rolled around chances are it may be a cyst of some kind and can be easily treated I have a personal story I had a horribly painful lump in my armpit and was more than frightened about the diagnosis of cancer I did make an appointment with my physician and after a full examination of the area and an ultrasound it was found that the area was a severely ingrown hair and the area had to be lanced and drained Simple wound care was required for a couple of weeks following the procedure Evidently there is a large percentage of women who shave our underarms incorrectly There is a name for these women They are known as rakers A raker is someone that glides the razor over and around the underarm area in an irratic manner across the direction of hair growth against the direction of hair growth whatever gets the job done and it causes irritation or folliculitis inflammation of the hair follicle and even an ingrown hair which can become extremely sore and enlarged due to the inflammation The correct procedure for shaving your underarms is as follows Start with wetting the underarm area with lukewarm water apply shaving cream specific to the sensitive area of the underarm area and use a great quality razor either disposable or reusable NEVER A DULL RAZOR Always glide the razor WITH the direction of hair growth This is information that you can use all the time especially if those painful underarm lumps are diagnosed as being ingrown underarm hair This is not to replace a visit or an examination by your physician ALWAYS SEE YOUR PHYSICIAN FOR ANY ABNORMALITIES FOUND IN THE BREAST LYMPH NODES OR UNDERARMS THIS CAN NOT BE STRESSED TOO MANY TIMES  The odds are overwhelming in your favor that the mass is benign and monitoring may be a viable option But few things are perfect and without possible glitches in this fast  paced world of 2014 I read of study comprised of about 125 individuals who had a FNA Fine Needle Aspiration test on a mass that originally was reported to be benign A 2nd FNA test on those participants found approximately 12 falsepositive individuals nearly 10 I suggest that you request a second FNA Fine Needle Aspiration test to verify the initial results Or to have the mass removed and biopsied The only choice that I would not make would be to accept the testing results as described in your question without a plan for followup actionThe sooner that any diseased cells are uncovered and treated if they were to exists the greater the chances of having a favorable outcome I wish you well and hope that this answer has been helpful Yes multiple myeloma is a cancer developing from malignant plasma cells Plasma is the fluid part of blood Therefore multiple myeloma is a disorder involving blood White antibody cells are produced in the bone marrow These cancerous cells tend to multiply and can affect multiple organs Yes multiple myeloma is a cancer developing from malignant plasma cells Plasma is the fluid part of blood Therefore multiple myeloma is a disorder involving blood White antibody cells are produced in the bone marrow These cancerous cells tend to multiply and can affect multiple organs  I am sorry for the duplication of my answer For some unknown reason my original answers may not always appear When I resubmit the answer again both responses will appear It is with sincere sorrow that I find myself answering your question My answer is honest and heartfelt This is just a suggestion but perhaps you would be better served by talking with your sisters oncologist The WebMd community is very knowledgeable and caring With that said I can only offer you my opinion because I care I am not a doctor and am not familiar with your sisters case and it really is just an opinion But if you wish to read on I will honestly try to provide you with some details as they relate to Pancreatic Cancer survival rates This stage of pancreatic cancer is classified as Stage 1V B because it has spread to the liver and other organs It presents with the grimmest prognosis Life expectancy is individualized based upon the degree of metastasis and the patients overall health According to some medical studies your sister may have only days weeks or several months for survival Some cases of lasting at least a year have been known to happen but are considered to be rare The 5 year survival rate is listed as less than 1 Hospice care sounds like a solid plan that will ensure that your sisters needs are well satisfied Since treating the cancer is no longer a viable option palliative care will be started to ensure that your sister always remains comfortable and as painfree as humanly possible Now is the time for you and your family to galvanize around each other and to celebrate your sisters life It is a time to reflect on your wonderful life togetherThe sibling relationship is very strong as it usually represents the longest time that we are bound on earth to any one particular relative I suggest the following actions for you to consider Visit your sister frequently listen to her wishes and her concerns talk about the good times and embrace each other tightly Then each evening go home talk with friends and family as you feel up to it eat all of your meals say a nightly prayer and rest well Above all your sister surely wants you to stay well May peace surround you during this challenging period of uncertainty  Your question provided specific and helpful details It was a great question Right up to the beginning of your final sentence Why would you suspect cancer I know that you are feeling uncomfortable and probably more than a little frustrated it is understandable But for the time being I would put cancer near the bottom of my list of possible causes for your condition Your PSA result was 12 and you had 2 DREs with normal results Urinary frequency can have many causes including infections injury to the bladder dietary influences urinary bladder stones benign enlargement of the prostate gland diabetes  medication side effects etc Treatment of frequent urination is directed at the specific cause Please do not give up in your quest for a diagnosis of this condition Many treatments are availableJust for example the following link is from a WebMD article citing twentytwo 22 different medications to treat frequent urinationThe first task that is necessary prior to treatment should be to ascertain the reason for your frequent urination httpwwwwebmdcomdrugscondition3258IncreasedUrinaryFrequencyaspxdiseaseid3258diseasenameIncreasedUrinaryFrequencysource0 Depending on the cause in office non surgical procedures as well as surgical procedures are available in addition to medications as possible treatment options through your urologist If your urologist is not investigating and testing for all medical and nonmedical causes of your condition then seeking a 2nd opinion from another urologist is justified With treatments for frequent urination readily available you deserve some resolution to your condition I had a brother who died after a 6 month hospitalization battling Acute Pancreatitis Thankfully the short answer to your question is no Most people that develop pancreatitis will never develop pancreatic cancer But pancreatitis is a risk factor for developing pancreatic cancer  Yes Parkinsons disease patients can become afflicted with some forms of cancer Your general practicing was correct but only revealed part of the complete answer Numerous studies have shown a protective neuron responsible for protects Parkinsons patients from some types of cancer The missing part was that some of those same studies showed a pronounced increase in cancer of the prostate skin cancers and other cancer types in patients diagnosed with Parkinsons disease I hope that this answer has been helpful and that youre feeling well I am sorry for your dads illness I suggest that before reading the balance of my answer that you consider whether or not you truly want to know some raw statistical data that may not be a fair representation for your fathers condition Perhaps it would be more appropriate to talk with one of the physicians treating your father  Lung cancer frequently metastasizes to the brain Radiation therapy is the preferred treatment method when this condition occurs The effectiveness of the treatment depends on 3 key factors 1 The number of tumors 2 The locations of the tumors 3 The overall health of the individual What are his chances of recovery Sadly up to 12 of the patients do not survive beyond five months Hopefully your dad will defy this grim prognosis I wish you your dad and your family peace during this period of uncertainty  Some studies suggest that following a nutritious diet may help a diseased liver to perform better and for a longer period of time and even help somewhat in restoring normal tissue The following foods are suggested It is recommended that you talk to a nutritionist and discuss your medical challenges along with foods that you like and do not like They can customize a diet that will help to improve your health without sacrificing great taste Inoperable squamous cell carcinoma tumors of the throat may respond positively to the following general treatments Chemo Therapy Radiation Therapy and medications directed in a targeted fashion to interfere with the tumors blood supply Finally the patient may consider becoming part of a clinical trial where new medications usually not yet approved to treat this type of cancer are provided with the hope of finding an effective treatment agent An elevated white blood count frequently is a sign that the body is trying to fight off infection Other possible reasons for the elevation of WBC are medication reactions autoimmune disorders and abnormalities of the bone marrow It is not on the top of my lists and I would not read too much into It but one specific cause of high WBC  The answer is that it just doesnt work on the most common kidney cancer types Chemotherapy is not indicated as an effective treatment method for kidney cancer except for one rare type renal carcinoma Most people with kidney cancer have the clear cell carcinoma variety Chemotherapy has been proven to be ineffective in treating clear cell carcinoma It would not be in the patients best interest to receive chemotherapy known to be ineffective for most forms of kidney cancer They would be subjecting the patient to needless sideeffects and wasting the window of opportunity available to use other effective treatment options I am sorry for your dads serious condition After 2 weeks of not eating or drinking a person would be close to death The human body when bedridden  where energy is barely being expended  can survive a maximum of 8 14 days without fluid intake  The hospital would have had a responsibility to treat your dad and stabilize him before discharging him from the ER Was he given IV fluids at the ER What instructions were provided by the ER prior to his discharge It would be interesting to know if your dad refused treatment Nutrition is a part of required medical treatment that must be provided by the hospitalBut the patient may refuse medications food and fluids just like any other medical treatments Unfortunatelywithout intervening with fluids almost immediately the body will shut down and death will soon occur I wish you well during this period of uncertainty The answer is a resounding yes  Waiting for a lung cancer diagnosis may be detrimental to the patients health and ultimately their prognosis According to Journal of Thoracic Disease  Many patients report delays in diagnosing their lung cancer disease This delay may contribute to advanced stage at diagnosis and poor long term survival Many aggressive lung cancer cases have already begun to spread by the time that they are initially discovered on screening studies In the large study cited by Journal of Thoracic Disease  patients waited 21 days before seeing a doctor and a further 22 days to complete any investigation The medium time frame from presentation to specialist referral was 27 days and a further 27 12 days to complete further investigation The medium wait time to begin treatment after entering a cancer treatment center was an additional 10 days The overall time from development of the first symptoms to starting treatment was 138 days or more than 4 months I hope that this answer has been helpful and that you are successful in fighting this disease  In most cases SCLC has already spread by the time it is found so it usually cannot be treated by surgery Chemotherapy and radiation are the preferred treating methods SCLC is typically staged according to progression of the cancer as follows Stage I SCLC When a patient has a single small tumor in their lung with no evidence of cancer in lymph nodes or elsewhere surgery to remove the tumor and the nearby lymph nodes may be a treatment option This is only an option if the person in good health and able to tolerate removing all or part of a lung Very few patients with SCLC are treated this way Limited stage SCLC For most people with limited stage SCLC surgery is not an option because the tumor is too large or it has spread to nearby lymph nodes or other places in the lung Extensive stage SCLC If a person has extensive SCLC and is in fairly good health chemotherapy is often the preferred treatment Unfortunately the cancer will still return at some point in almost all people with extensive stage SCLC Summary and Conclusions Surgery for SCLC is usually not a viable treatment option It is suggested to talk with the treating oncologist and ascertain the stage of SCLC the proposed treatment methods along with statistical data on those treatment results and the prognosis for longterm survival  CT scans have been associated with a small increased risk of developing cancer The cancer may not be diagnosed until many years after having had received the scans The amount of radiation received during a CT scan can be far greater than that of the typical xray The larger the area being examined through the scan results in larger doses of radiation being received It has been reported that one 1 CT scan to the abdominal region exposes the patient to roughly the equivalent of five 5 years worth of natural sun exposure Please open the link below for a WebMd article on the topic httpblogswebmdcomcancer201206arectscansraisingourcancerriskhtml I recommend that you talk with your physician on the subject That individual is in the best position to explain how the potential benefits received from your CT scans will outweigh any possible cancer risks The CT scan is a wonderful diagnostic tool that can save lives but should be used judicially Yes clinical studies investigating possible Wellbutrin side effects report that its usage may contribute to Almost all of this drug and its metabolites are excreted through the kidney It has been recommended by various pharmacology sources that individuals with kidney related conditions should only use Wellbutrin at its lowest possible dosage Sutures usually remain in place for 710 days so its time for their removal It is always best to have stiches surgical sutures removed by a medical professional Besides removing the sutures that person can assess the wound and how it healed But I realize that that is always not practical It is actually a relative safe and easy process to accomplish by yourself or with the assistance of a friend or family member Here are the steps Check that healing of the sutured area appears to be complete While not entirely necessary I suggest purchasing a suture removal kit from the pharmacy or medical supply store They are compact disposal and relatively inexpensive Wash your hands for a few minutes with soap and warm water Clean the area with an antiseptic lotion Begin by lifting in a gentle manner any one of the sutures close to the skin with tweezers Do not stretch the skin While holding the knot cut the suture with the other hand and gently pull it out by the knot Repeat the process in no particular order until all sutures are removed Clean the area again with an antiseptic lotion I am a proponent of triple antibiotic cream which may be found in some dollar stores Place a clean bandage over the area I came from a large family of 6 children where being stitchedup was a common occurrence Mom removing the sutures in an uneventful manner was also a common occurrence If you notice any redness swelling or excessive pain then do not hesitate seek emergency attention I will attempt to provide useful and candid information in this response to your question Technically the overall recovery may be possible but the odds are highly against a cure Many cases of liver cancers began with liver cirrhosis Liver cirrhosis causes permanent liver damage through scarring to a specific area of the liver it could be a small area or a large area of scarring Liver cirrhosis when diagnosed early and after completely terminating alcohol usage can arrest the cirrhosis disease process Once liver cancer has been diagnosed the odds of long term survival is greatly diminished Surgery for liver cancer provides the best chance for survival but its success is based on several factors including the exact location of the cancer within the liver the size of the tumor the larger the tumor the more negative the outlook for complete tumor removal  whether spreading to other organs has occurred and how much healthy liver area will be left after the tumor is removed If the surgeon is able to remove all of the cancer that is seen and spreading to other organs has not occurred then recovery is possible The mission at surgery must be to remove all visible cancer growths while leaving enough of the healthy liver area for proper body functioning The truth of the matter is that many people with cirrhosis have had extensive liver damage and will not have enough healthy liver left after the cancer removal surgery The case cited in your question is unique to that individual Thereforeit is best to discuss specific questions and my response with the hepatic doctor andor oncologist assigned to the case I wish the patient well during this period of medical uncertainty  The Whipple procedure  named for a 1920s physician surgically treats pancreatic cancer by eliminating the head and sometimes the body of the pancreas Also removed is usually part of the stomach the small intestine and lymph nodes in the vicinity of the pancreas The gallbladder and common bile duct are also typically removed This operation is now a common treatment for endocrine cancer of the pancreas The 5 year survival rate for pancreatic cancer is a dismal 5 After employing the Whipple procedure  the 5 year survival rate increases to about 20 This surgery in many cases does not always resolve the cancer completely Although visible signs may indicate complete removal of the pancreatic cancer through the Whipple Procedure  some cancerous cells may have already affected other nearby structures It seems like this is the case for your father Over time these cancerous cells grow into tumors that can threaten life The return of the cancer to the pancreas andor other organs is to be expected even when all cancer of the pancreas seemed to have been eliminated with the Whipple Procedure  At this point of time the prognosis must be considered as very guarded Survival is based upon the stage of cancer development  available treatment options and the patients overall health I am not sure of the viability in your fathers situation but some positive results have been produced by Cold Laser Therapy I recommend that the doctor be questioned on why the treatment modality is being confined to only chemotherapy Determine if the treatment option being offered is only palliative and not really curative in nature Ask directly about the prognosis and odds for survival These questions deserve honest answers If necessary seek out a second medical opinion I wish your father and his family peace during this challenging period of time  The Whipple

a second medical opinion I wish your father and his family peace during this challenging period of time  A tumor is a growth Therefore a Lipoma is a tumor It is a growth composed of fat cells The vast majority of Lipoma tumors turn out to be benign and require no treatment The malignant counterpart to a Lipoma tumor is Liposarcoma and requires treatment Some patients and their doctors feel that all Lipoma tumors should be excised to ensure the tumors being benign through a pathological examination Other reasons for removal include aesthetics and possible intrusion on adjacent muscles and nerves I recommend that you have a surgeon familiar with Lipomas to confirm that the tumor is benign Most doctors can differentiate a begin Lipoma from a malignant Lipoma by simply palpating the growth I also recommend that at a minimum to have the growth biopsied Of course youre scared Cavalier and vague statements were made to you concerning a serious medical condition Difficult as it may be please attempt to focus your energy on the positive point reported to you after the colonoscopy That is Precancerous polyp Polyps are routinely discovered and removed during a colonoscopy Most of these polyps are classified as being precancerous I am surprised that your doctor left you with unanswered questions that only they can answer After all they are your doctor have access to all of your diagnosing reports have actually inspected your colon and have you available to provide a complete medical history It seems inappropriate to have your colon compared to one found in the body of a 60 year old without further elaboration What does the colon of a 60 year old look like anyway It is also an ambiguous statement at best to cite the precancerous polyp as being on the point of changing Changing to what Does that statement really even refer to cancer You should not have to make wild guesses after having talked to the doctor about such a serious issue Here are my suggestions offered in a respectful manner Spinal cord and brain cancer are sometimes treatable through surgical tumor removal The stages of various cancers are determined by how far and quickly they have spread throughout the body Cancers of the brain and spinal cord do not usually spread beyond the central nervous system are therefore not typically graded  Treatment options and survival estimates are instead based upon age of the patient type of tumor Glioblastoma Meningioma etc size and location of the tumor surgical removal possibilities whether the tumor has spread into the cerebral spinal fluid and other factors Treatment and 5 year survival rates are based on past medical accountings and is at best a rough guess estimate Were all individuals with unique recovering abilities  Your decision should be based in large part upon the stage of the cancer development Like many cancers early detection usually results in a more promising prognosis Knowing if your cancer is at stage 123 or 4 is useful information You and your doctor can then more accurately assess the possible benefits versus the potential side effects of chemotherapy A couple of thoughts that are worth mentioning include the following 1I have read that the advanced age of the individual does not impact the ultimate success effect rate of chemotherapy for kidney cancer patients 2Survival rates of elderly and younger patients who receive chemotherapy to treat kidney cancer are very similar 3 If your cardiovascular disorder is severe you may just want to sit back and not subject yourself to the additional rigors and side effects of chemotherapy Chemotherapy is hard on the body and in order to justify it as a treatment option you must be physically and emotionally prepared to endure its adverse side effects 4 Another unfortunate determining agent in todays world of medical treatment is the medical insurance bean counter Some providers may feel that medical care should be distributed only to those who will most likely benefit This principle is commonly referred to as Resource Allocation  You may windup not only fighting cancer but also doing battle with a bureaucratic medical insurance provider to pay for treatment I wish you peace of mind and more years of productive living Your decision should be based in large part upon the stage of the cancer development Like many cancers early detection

spinal cord and brain is not graded  This is because the cancer usually does not spread out of the central nervous system Treatment and survival data is determined instead by the specific cancer type meningioma etc age of the patient size and location of the tumor and the degree of surgical removal potential for the tumor With brain and spinal cord cancer treatment and survival is based upon past medical accountings and is at best a rough guess Were all individuals with unique recovering abilities According to the American Cancer Society a strong risk factor does exist for developing pancreatic cancer after having been afflicted with chronic pancreatitis This risk factor was observed to be strongest amongst smokers The American Cancer Society also cites that people affected with the inherited form of chronic pancreatitis have a strong lifetime risk of developing pancreatic cancer The jury is still out on this question No exact cause for the development of stomach ulcers has been established with any degree of scientific certainty As a matter of fact some studies have concluded that duodenal ulcers may actually protect an individual from stomach cancer Peptic ulcer development on the other hand has some of the same risk factors that are seen with stomach cancer What is known i s that a bacterial strain called HPylori can settle in the stomach cause inflammation ulcers and lead to stomach cancer In conclusion No causal relationship between stomach cancer and ulcers has been proven The short answer is no WebMD talks about kidney disease with an article accessed through the following link httpwwwwebmdcomatozguidesunderstandingkidneydiseasebasicinformation Chronic kidney disease is referred to as kidney failure and may be attributable to issues such as infections high blood pressure and other reasons Kidney cancer is a cancer that originates in the kidney It is not exactly known what causes renal carcinoma What is known is that cell mutations occur within the kidney s DNA structure causing tumor growth  Hi your moms oncologist is in the best position to assess the dos and donts while receiving cancer treatment Is she receiving radiation or chemotherapy Typically using hair coloring products while receiving chemotherapy is discouraged by the medical experts Based upon my research hair coloring should not be done until 612 months after stopping chemotherapy and then only by using an allnatural plant based dye A similar question was asked on WebMD three years ago and received 30 responses The link to the question and its responses was inserted below this answer I hope that you find these anecdotal accountings helpful httpforumswebmdcom3breastcancerexchangeforum15613 There is a product called Pure Henna I have no interest in this hair treatment but do care about cancer patients It is made from a plant called Henna that is used to make some medicines including hair coloring products It may and also contain indigo that is also listed as being 100 herbal The following is a link to a WebMd article discussing Henna httpwwwwebmdcomvitaminssupplementsingredientmono854HENNAaspxactiveIngredientId854activeIngredientNameHENNA It is advertised as being 100 herbal without any hair dye chemicals or metallic salts added It is promoted as being nontoxic and safe for those who require chemicalfree hair coloring Of course each doctor may have their own individual feelings about organic rinses and the potential of them interacting with the chemotherapy Check with your moms physician first but I can see this product as one that the doctors may permit her to use You may view more information about this product through searching Renaissance Henna on the web Your mother deserves to feel their best in every possible way I truly hope that you find an acceptable product meets her needs Best wishes for her complete recovery  The jury is still out on this question but I suspect that chlorinated drinking water does have some responsibility for the occurrence of bladder cancer Some clinical studies involving bladder cancer and chlorination of drinking water dance around the results This avoidance of providing a clear bottom line result is accomplished by stressing the benefits of water disinfection through the chlorination process as outweighing bladder cancer concerns According to Cancer research uk long term drinking of tap water containing high levels of THM chemicals increases the likely hood of bladder cancer development When chlorine is used to disinfect water it can breakdown into chemicals called trihalomethanes THMs As a side note these chemicals can also be absorbed into the skin or breathed in as water droplets when bathing showering or swimming in chlorinated water The increased risk for bladder cancer after long term exposure to THMs has been estimated to be twofold The risk was higher for men than women Yes spleen cancer can occur The spleen is part of the lymphatic system is located on the left abdominal side and helps to fight infections and assists in blood purification Fatigue abdominal pain chills itching loss of appetite and loss of weight are some of the symptoms seen in splenic cancer Symptoms may not readily be apparent and can take as long as 2 years to become recognizable Spleen cancer may appear in different forms and is included under the general umbrella of Splenic Cancer Spleen cancer survival and treatment methods vary depending upon the type of cancer discovered Hodgkins Disease and Lymphoma tumors may respond favorably to treatment while leukemia and metastases are not as hopeful In most cases cirrhosis causes liver cancer  Youll see best what I mean by my defining some terms as listed below in my five 5 points It sounds like your brotherinlaw is very sick Before he takes Plantain Tea  the potential risks and possible rewards should be considered as follows Pros for taking  He has been given no chance of surviving his medical condition  Although not supported with clinical testing Plantain Tea may have some beneficial properties that will help his condition  It may prove to be catalyst in providing a ray of hope to an otherwise hopeless patient Cons for taking  It can provide a false sense of hope that could be devastating to the patient if positive results are not obtained Ive not seen or heard of clinical studies showing that Plantain Tea will have positive results in treating cancer  Your brotherinlaw does not need to experience any uncomfortable and possibly unnecessary sideeffects from this tea I have not seen or heard of studies for its potential to interact with other medications This tea is also known for causing stomach distress in the form of gas  diarrhea It has also been reported to cause a lowering of blood pressure and a speeding up of the heart beating My conclusions These conclusions are offered as my personal opinions with sincerity and respect If I were the patient despite the possible negative sideeffects I would more than likely try Plantain Tea  I have always lived by the principle that you cant kill a dead person knowing that I had already been given up with no hope to survive would motivate me to try Plantain Tea and just about any other reasonable therapeutic remedy I want to live and would want every treatment option to be used The sideeffects do not seem life threatening and I could always discontinue the tea if the it caused me too much discomfort I recommend that you discuss the pros and cons of the tea with your brotherinlaw In the end the decision should be his I applaud you for being a caring person and wish your brothinlaw  his family peace during these turbulent times It sounds like your brotherinlaw is very sick Before he takes Plantain Tea

treating cancer  Your brotherinlaw does not need to experience any uncomfortable and possibly unnecessary sideeffects from this tea I have not seen or heard of studies for its potential to interact with other medications This tea is also known for causing stomach distress in the form of gas  diarrhea It has also been reported to cause a lowering of blood pressure and a speeding up of the heart beating My conclusions These conclusions are offered as my personal opinions with sincerity and respect If I were the patient despite the possible negative sideeffects I would more than likely try Plantain Tea  I have always lived by the principle that you cant kill a dead person knowing that I had already been given up with no hope to survive would motivate me to try Plantain Tea and just about any other reasonable therapeutic remedy I want to live and would want every treatment option to be used The sideeffects do not seem life threatening and I could always discontinue the tea if the it caused me too much discomfort I recommend that you discuss the pros and cons of the tea with your brotherinlaw In the end the decision should be his I applaud you for being a caring person and wish your brothinlaw  his family peace during these turbulent times  Years ago some scientists studied the effects in humans of eating large quantities of unripe bananas It had been speculated that chlorophyll in the banana plant may breakdown during the green to yellow ripping process Those fears turnedout to be without merit Bananas should be safe to eat before they are entirely ripe they have not been found to cause cancer As a matter of interest bananas have been found to help in controlling high blood pressure cramping of muscles and heart disease Other studies even suggest that bananas may help to prevent some forms of cancer  Internet sites attribute no known cause for cancer of the appendix With that said my good sense tells me that there is a cause relationship involved between cancer of the appendix and the family I say that for several reasons Number one many other medical conditions have a proven inherited component Number two cancers of the appendix are very rare yet look how it has affected your family Thats more than just bad karma Number three on the general principle that I just dont usually buy into coincidences Cancers of the appendix are usually not discovered until an appendectomy is performed Signs of the disease may be abdominal pain bowel obstruction appendicitis and increase in abdomen size most likely due to fluid accumulation hernias or ovarian masses Roughly 1 out of every 300 appendectomy cases involved the removal of a cancerous appendix That equates to approximately 1 of all appendectomy specimens containing neoplastic cells Treatment for a cancerous appendix may involve its surgical removal along with adjacent areas of the colon Also available as options are chemotherapy and radiation Treatment decisions depend on when the cancer was discovered access to medical care the progression and spread of the growths and the age and overall health of the individual It was interesting to learn that many cancers found in the appendix actually originated in the colon but was not diagnosed until pain in the appendix region presented itself In those cases the patients diagnosis should have been colon cancer that metalized to the appendix and not appendix cancer Non Small Cell is the most common form of lung cancer 85  90  of lung cancers are of the NonSmall Cell variety The following lung cancer types are considered to be NSCLC Squamous or epidermoid carcinoma  15 Adenocarcinoma including bronchioloalveolar  17 Large cell carcinoma sometimes called large cell anaplastic  11 Represents 5 year survival rate Like many forms of cancer staging is graded from 1 to 1V based on size invasion to lymph nodes and other organs and metastasis Treatment for NSCLC is based upon staging with stages 1 and 2 being candidates for surgery while stage  3 uses radiation as its main weapon to fight the disease Radiation is also used with some stage 1 and 2 NSCLC cases Chemotherapy is usually not an option for treating NSCLC as it provides perhaps only 1 or 2 months to overall survival It is suggested that you talk with a medical professional to obtain the latest facts about NSCLC Also recommended is to read the WebMD article that better explains NSCLC Access the article by placing the below link in your computer browser httpwwwwebmdcomlungcancerguidenosmallcelllungcancer   I also read about this study and will expand on the details listed in your question It is an interesting study that ultimately must be verified and judged by the scientific experts Although nutrition and medical experts say that its too soon to draw cause and effect conclusions some of the points reported in the study cause me genuine health concerns Here some factors considered in conducting the study The findings emerged from a study of 6381 people aged 50 and over who took part in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey which tracks a representative group of adults and children in the US People who took part in the study consumed an average of 1823 calories a day with 51 coming from carbohydrates 33 from fat and 16 from protein of which two thirds was animal protein Here are some of the points developed by the study High levels of dietary animal protein in people under 65 years of age was linked to a four times increase in their risk of death from cancer or diabetes and almost double the risk of dying from any cause over an 18year period researchers found The overall harmful effects seen in the study were almost completely wiped out when the protein came from plant sources such as beans and legumes though cancer risk was still three times as high in middleaged people who ate a proteinrich diet compared with those on a lowprotein diet My impressions and conclusions are Its one study and more research needs to occur The validity of the study must be confirmable through the official publication of its results to the scientific community for peer review The study must be able to be replicated One group of people the senior citizens actually seemed to benefit from a diet rich in proteins In the over 65 age population  a highprotein diet cut the risk of death from any cause by 28 and reduced cancer deaths by 60 according to the published study The one point made in the study that I cannot endorse is in comparing the effects of smoking with the effect of a high protein diet Maybe its me but I question which step in the Scientific Method was employed to draw such a conclusion Personally Im not waiting for more evidence to convince me that the studys conclusions are at least plausible and most likely accurate I see enough of a correlation in this study for folks under the age of 65 between consuming a protein rich diet and cancer to adjust my eating habits Lung cancer may spread to other organs of the body including the stomach or to the other lung When cancer spreads to other organs it is referred to as metastasis Therefore a cancer originating in the lungs and which has spread to the stomach is called  Sometimes it can be difficult to determine which original organ was first assaulted by cancer cells At times the metastasized cancer may actually be uncovered and treated before the primary organ where the cancer originated is discovered Treatment options are dependent on the number of tumors the stage of cancer development when discovered in the stomach and the overall general health of the patient Since the total areas where cancer has spread is unknown surgery for removal of the stomach is not the usual treatment preference More likely are chemotherapy alternatives that can systematically attack all of the cancer cells  Back pain is a frequent symptom seen in lung cancer cases The two 2 main reasons for the back pain include I hope that this answer has been helpful and wish you well  I feel sincere sorrow for your diagnosis of lung cancer I will be honest and provide you with some basic facts as I know them to be It is not unusual for lung cancer to metastasize to the liver This metastasizing may occur in as many as 40 of lung cancer patients Liver enzymes such as transaminase and alkaline phosphatase may increase Increased levels of calcium in the blood hypercalcemia  is also a possible cancer complication which must be treated With an early diagnosis aggressive treatment and a positive attitude you can be victorious and have a longterm productive life I wish you well as you fight cancer  This stage of pancreatic cancer is classified as Stage 1V B because it has spread to the liver It presents with the grimmest prognosis Life expectancy is individualized based upon the degree of metastasis and the patients overall health According to some medical studies your husband may have only days weeks or several months for survival Some cases of lasting at least a year have been known to happen but are considered to be rare The 5 year survival rate is listed as less than 1 Palliative care may be started to ensure that your husband always remains comfortable and as painfree as humanly possible Now is the time for you and your family to galvanize around each other and to celebrate your husbands life It is a time to reflect on your wonderful life together and your accomplishments as a couple Visit your husband frequently listen to his wishes and his concerns talk about the good times and embrace each other tightly Then each evening go home talk with friends and family as you feel up to it eat all of your meals say your nightly prayers and rest well Above all your husband surely wants you to stay well May peace surround you during this challenging period of uncertainty WHAT IS THE NORMAL POTASSIUM LEVEL You need to see a doctor immediately It sounds like you have a serious condition not sure what it could be but you should definitely be looked at as soon as possible First I HATE CANCER My daughter has it and I am a nurse so I know what she is going thru Is your brother a small person or a large person I only ask because I would think that if the testicles are not hurting too much he may just could wear a larger size of some really soft boxerbriefs they would feel soft on the skin and yet give some gentle support without feeling so constricted Right now if he was here I could fashion him something that would be comfy but not knowing it is hard for me to say If you have a mom or a grandma maybe fashion some sort of sling that would have some soft wide elastic at the top and then the fabric attached to the front and the back going under the scrotum holding them softly up a little so they dont hang and hurt him when he is up and walking or even just sitting in a chair I can see it in my mind so clear I know it would work Use some sheep skin material for the supporter that would attach to the wider elastic band that would go around him and thru his legs and connect to the back Then all he would have to do is just step into it and pull it up GOSH I hope someone in your family can sew this would be so great for him I hope this helped this brave guy some Blessings and be well When you die Keep on having those wonderful tests It saves lives I know of one person that had a colonoscopy and it saved his life By the time you think you are having some problems it could be too late I am every five years now Grin and bear it I have never heard anything linking cancer to bipolar disorder or schizophrenia It is possible that the stress of living with and being treated for cancer might have triggered or exacerbated any latent mental issues she may have had but for cancer and mental health issues to be linked seems very very unlikely Keep in mind that many people suffer from mental illnesses for years before being diagnosed especially if their symptoms are minor and nondisruptive and stressful events can cause any underlying issues to rapidly deteriorate It is possible that your friend is unfortunately one of many to slip through the cracks Even in recent years diagnosis and treatment of psychological issues can be very difficult as not everyone responds the same even to the most reliable methods I recently went to my Gynecologist and well I was told that I had abnormal cells on the cervix and that HPV caused it My Doctor said that everybody has HPV if you had sex at least once That is why you need to have that papsmear done every year to detect cancer cells which are caused by this HPV virus in between other things  So needless to say that you cannot avoid transmitting it to him since he already has it unless he has never had sex Dont quote me I read about it and it enforces what my Doctor said according to the info I got however educated and uneducated people will have different discussions about this The best thing is to go see your own personal doctor and ask them these questions Good Luck  My Lipase levels were higher than that and it was because of gall stones At first it felt like I had gas that wouldnt pass I had my gall bladder removed and within 3 mos I was back to normal There are a number of exercises that you can do to relax during your breast cancer fight These exercises include breathing muscle and mind

combative or passive Learn to relax Exercise regularly Your body can fight stress better when you are physically fit Eat wellbalanced meals Rest and sleep Your body needs time to recover from stressful events Dont rely on alcohol or drugs to reduce stress Consider joining a support group Lymphedema develops after breast surgery because there is an alteration in the pathway that drains the fluids involved in the immune system It can occur at any time after the surgery If untreated it can become worse Following breast cancer surgery a doctor will examine you and take arm measurements Sometimes there may be redness or pain in the arm which may be a sign of inflammation Depending on your symptoms your physician will then consider the best treatment options for you The exact reason for cancerrelated fatigue is unknown It may be related to the disease itself or its treatments The following cancer treatments are commonly associated with fatigue Chemotherapy Any chemotherapy drug may cause fatigue Fatigue usually develops after several weeks of chemotherapy In some fatigue lasts a few days while others say the problem persists throughout the course of treatment and even after the treatment is complete Radiation therapy Radiation can cause fatigue that increases over time This can occur regardless of the treatment site Fatigue usually lasts from three to four weeks after treatment stops but can continue for up to two to three months Combination therapy More than one cancer treatment at the same time or one after the other increases the chances of developing fatigue Bone marrow transplant This aggressive form of treatment can cause fatigue that lasts up to one year Biological therapy In high amounts the biological substances used can be toxic and lead to persistent fatigue Tumor cells compete for nutrients often at the expense of the normal cells growth In addition to fatigue weight loss and decreased appetite are common Decreased nutrition from the side effects of treatments such as nausea vomiting mouth sores taste changes heartburn or diarrhea can cause fatigue Cancer treatments specifically chemotherapy can cause reduced blood counts which may lead to anemia a blood disorder that occurs when the blood cannot adequately transport oxygen through the body When tissues dont get enough oxygen fatigue can result Medicines used to treat side effects such as nausea pain depression anxiety and seizures can cause fatigue Research shows that chronic severe pain increases fatigue Stress can worsen feelings of fatigue Stress can result from dealing with the disease and the unknowns as well as from worrying about daily accomplishments or trying to meet the expectations of others Fatigue may occur when you try to maintain your normal daily routine and activities during treatments Modifying your schedule and activities can help conserve energy Depression and fatigue often go handinhand It may not be clear which started first One way to sort this out is to try to understand your depressed feelings and how they affect your life If you are depressed all the time were depressed before your cancer diagnosis are preoccupied with feeling worthless and useless you may need treatment for depression The best way to combat fatigue is to treat the underlying medical cause Unfortunately the exact cause is often unknown or there may be multiple causes There are some treatments that may help improve fatigue caused by an underactive thyroid or anemia Other causes of fatigue must be managed on an individual basis The following guidelines should help you combat fatigue Assessment Keep a diary for one week to identify the time of day when you are either most fatigued or have the most energy Note what you think may be contributing factors Be alert to your personal warning signs of fatigue Fatigue warning signs may include tired eyes tired legs wholebody tiredness stiff shoulders decreased energy or a lack of energy inability to concentrate weakness or malaise boredom or lack of motivation sleepiness increased irritability nervousness anxiety or impatience Energy Conservation There are several ways to conserve your energy Here are some suggestions Plan ahead and organize your work Change storage of items to reduce trips or reaching Delegate tasks when needed Combine activities and simplify details Schedule rest Balance periods of rest and work Rest before you become fatigued  frequent short rests are beneficial Pace yourself A moderate pace is better than rushing through activities Reduce sudden or prolonged strains Alternate sitting and standing Practice proper body mechanics When sitting use a chair with good back support Sit up with your back straight and your shoulders back Adjust the level of your work  work without bending over When bending to lift something bend your knees and use your leg muscles to lift not your back Do not bend forward at the waist with your knees straight Carry several small loads instead of one large one or use a cart Limit work that requires reaching over your head Use longhandled tools Store items lower Delegate activities when possible Limit work that increases muscle tension Breathe evenly do not hold your breath Wear comfortable clothes to allow for free and easy breathing Identify effects of your environment Avoid temperature extremes Eliminate smoke or harmful fumes Avoid long hot showers or baths Prioritize your activities Decide what activities are important to you and what could be delegated Use your energy on important tasks Cancerrelated fatigue is often made worse if you are not eating or drinking enough or if you are not eating the right foods Maintaining good nutrition can help you feel better and have more energy The following are strategies to help improve nutritional intake Get plenty of protein Protein rebuilds and repairs damaged and normally aging body tissue The best sources of protein include foods from the dairy group 8 oz milk  8 grams protein and meats meat fish or poultry  7 grams of protein per ounce Drink plenty of fluids A minimum of 8 cups of fluid per day will prevent dehydration Thats 64 oz 2 quarts or 1 halfgallon Fluids can include juice milk broth milkshakes gelatin and other beverages Of course water is fine too Beverages containing caffeine do NOT count Keep in mind that youll need more fluids if you have treatment side effects such as vomiting or diarrhea Make sure you are getting enough vitamins Speak with your doctor about taking a vitamin supplement if you are not sure you are getting enough nutrients A recommended supplement would be a multivitamin that provides at least 100 of the recommended daily allowances RDA for most nutrients Note Vitamin supplements do not provide calories which are essential for energy production So vitamins cannot substitute for adequate food intake Make an appointment with a dietitian A registered dietitian provides suggestions to work around any eating problems that may be interfering with proper nutrition such as early feeling of fullness swallowing difficulty or taste changes A dietitian can also suggest ways to maximize calories and include proteins in smaller amounts of food such as powdered milk instant breakfast drinks and other commercial supplements or food additives Decreased physical activity which may be the result of cancer or of treatment can lead to tiredness and lack of energy Scientists have found that even healthy athletes forced to spend extended periods in bed or sitting in chairs develop feelings of anxiety depression weakness fatigue and nausea Regular moderate exercise can decrease these feelings help you stay active and increase your energy Even during cancer therapy it is often possible to continue exercising In fact research has shown that cancer patients who perform a moderate exercise routine have a better quality of life and better outcomes Here are some exercise guidelines to keep in mind if you have cancer Check with your doctor before beginning an exercise program A good exercise program starts slowly allowing your body time to adjust Keep a regular exercise schedule Exercising at least three times a week is optimal The right kind of exercise never makes you feel sore stiff or exhausted If you experience soreness stiffness exhaustion or feel out of breath as a result of your exercise you are overdoing it Most exercises are safe as long as you exercise with caution and dont overdo it The safest and most productive activities are swimming brisk walking indoor stationary cycling and lowimpact aerobics taught by a certified instructor These activities carry little risk of injury and benefit your entire body Managing stress can play an important role in combating cancerrelated fatigue Here are some suggestions that may help Adjust your expectations For example if you have a list of 10 things you want to accomplish today pare it down to two and leave the rest for other days A sense of accomplishment goes a long way to reducing stress Help others understand and support you Family and friends can be helpful if they can put themselves in your shoes and understand what fatigue means to you Cancer groups can be a source of support as well Other people with cancer understand what you are going through Relaxation techniques such as audiotapes that teach deep breathing or visualization can help reduce stress Activities that divert your attention away from fatigue can also be helpful For example activities such as knitting reading or listening to music require little physical energy but require attention If your stress seems out of control talk to a health care professional Although cancerrelated fatigue is a common and often expected side effect of cancer and its treatments you should feel free to mention your concerns to your doctors There are times when fatigue may be a clue to an underlying medical problem Other times there may be treatments to help control some of the causes of fatigue Finally there may be suggestions that are more specific to your situation that would help in combating your fatigue Be sure to let your doctor or nurse know if you have Increased shortness of breath with minimal exertion Uncontrolled pain Inability to control side effects from treatments such as nausea vomiting diarrhea or loss of appetite Uncontrollable anxiety or nervousness Ongoing depression You could try natural remediesIf you want more info on this i can give you a wellness centers number and emailI have gone to the wellness

common treatment for penile cancer A doctor may take out the cancer using one of the following operations Wide local excision takes out only the cancer and some normal tissue on either side Electrodessication and curettage removes the cancer by scraping the tumor with a curette thin long instrument with a scraping edge and applying an electric current to the area to kill cancer cells Cryosurgery uses liquid nitrogen to freeze and kill the cancer cells Microsurgery Mohs surgery is an operation that removes the cancer and as little normal tissue as possible During this surgery the doctor uses a microscope to look at the cancerous area to make sure all the cancer cells are removed Laser surgery uses a narrow beam of light to remove cancer cells Circumcision is an operation that removes the foreskin Amputation of the penis penectomy is an operation that removes the penis It is the most common and most effective treatment of cancer of the penis In a partial penectomy part of the penis is removed In a total penectomy the whole penis is removed Lymph nodes in the groin may be taken out during surgery Radiation which uses highenergy rays to attack cancer and chemotherapy which uses drugs to kill cancer are other treatment options The exact cause of penile cancer is not known but there are certain risk factors for the disease A risk factor is anything that increases a persons chance of getting a disease The risk factors for cancer of the penis may include the following Uncircumcision Men who are not circumcised at birth have a higher risk for getting cancer of the penis Human papilloma virus HPV infection HPV includes more than 100 types of viruses that can cause warts papillomas Certain types of HPV can infect the reproductive organs and the anal area These types of HPV are passed from one person to another during sexual contact Smoking Smoking exposes the body to many cancercausing chemicals that affect more than the lungs Smegma Oily secretions from the skin can accumulate under the foreskin of the penis The result is a thick badsmelling substance called smegma If the penis is not cleaned thoroughly the presence of smegma can cause irritation and inflammation Phimosis This is a condition in which the foreskin becomes constricted and difficult to retract Treatment for psoriasis The skin disease psoriasis is sometimes treated with a combination of medication and exposure to ultraviolet light which may increase a persons risk for penile cancer Age Over half of the cases of penile cancer occur in men over age 68 Penile cancer is a rare form of cancer that occurs when abnormal cells in the penis divide and grow uncontrolled Certain benign noncancerous tumors may progress and become cancer Symptoms of penile cancer include growths or sores on the penis abnormal discharge from beneath the foreskin and bleeding A medically induced coma is when a patient receives a controlled dose of an anesthetic typically propofol pentobarbital or thiopental to cause a temporary coma or a deep state of unconsciousness This type of coma is used to protect the brain from swelling by reducing the metabolic rate of brain tissue as well as the cerebral blood flow Throughout a medically induced coma a patients critical life functions are constantly monitored by an anesthesiologist or other physician in a critical care setting only I was probably vaccinated I didnt check but I have all my vaccinations for sure I will tell her to get it but to make sure insurance covers it thank you It is really important if you have a lot of moles and freckles and have had exposure to sun over the time which is what freckles imply that you have a regular skin cancer screening There are lots of ways that you can have a free screening done and you can try going to your local hospital and see if they have annual skin cancer screenings that are for free and have your moles checked that way and then if anything looks suspicious the doctor will recommend that you see a dermatologist to have that mole removed What you are describing sounds like a seborrheic keratosis which is a benign condition however this needs to be evaluated by your dermatologist who will be able to either treat the symptoms and reassure you or do a biopsy to send the lesion to the lab for further evaluation and treat it as needed Gastroenterologist No pictures of bone caner tumors The only test I know of is the PSA blood test a biopsy may be needed if psa is high Alot depends on the type of tumor and where its located A tumor on the pancreas may very well affect the secretion of insulin and affect blood sugar levels Kidney involvement could affect the blood pressure Keep in mind that there are so many variables that can affect both blood sugar and blood pressure that are not tumor related Celery green peppers thyme  and chamomile tea  all contain a phytochemical that research suggests has strong antiinflammatory action Plant components phytochemicals appear to have the ability to protect us from harmful inflammation which can increase the risk of cancer heart disease and insulin resistance Additional clues about how plant compounds help prevent cancer and other disease have been revealed thanks to a series of studies from the Western Human Nutrition Research Center in Davis Calif The researchers are careful to point out that several key questions still need to be answered such as Are the compounds as effective in humans as they are in labcultured cells What amounts of the phytochemicals do our bodies actually absorb and use from the foods we eat The six plant compounds that the researchers specifically investigated because they are thought to act as antiinflammatory agents are luteolin quercetin chrysin eriodicytol hesperetin and naringenin Here are a couple of the phytochemical discoveries  The six phytochemicals studied were shown to inhibit a particular enzymes ability to activate a biochemical signal that leads to inflammation  Luteolin was the most effective inhibitor of the proinflammatory enzyme Luteolin can be found in celery thyme green peppers and chamomile tea Foods rich in quercetin include capers apples and onions Oranges grapefruit lemons and other citrus fruits are good sources of hesperetin eriodicytol and naringenin Consider this another good reason to add more fruits and vegetables to your everyday diet Im sorry to hear what youre going through Its probably rather alarming Some swelling of the feet and ankles is common with pregnancy However if you have been diagnosed with and this swelling is new I would suggest you contact your OBGYN to let him or her know of this development The fluid retention in your lower limbs may be nothing to worry about And then again it might be Your best bet is to not try diagnosing this yourself Let your doctor do it If youve been diagnosed with preeclampsia and experience sudden swelling of the hands arms or face then you should contact your doctor right away Wishing you and your baby well Im sorry to hear of your mothers cancer but am happy to learn it was discovered early and had not spread elsewhere in her body That is very good news When you ask will she do OK I think you mean will she survive Its impossible to answer that question When a person gets cancer there is always a chance of it spreading or returning whether or not they receive additional treatment like chemotherapy Your mother is not very elderly at age 75 but it sounds like she has made a choice in favor of quality of life This is certainly her decision to make You can give your mom peace of mind by being very supportive of her choice Do not feel if the cancer returns that she made a mistake by opting out of chemotherapy Having the drug treatment may not have kept any future cancer away anyway Enjoy the time you have together now and try not to worry too much about what tomorrow holds Your mother may outlive us all Wishing you and your mother well Im so sorry you lost your dad I lost my dad a couple of years ago I completely understand your wanting answers about how he died Perhaps the best answer is this Medicine doesnt know everything We cant keep people from dying Its no comfort to know that but its true From a pathophysiology standpoint I can tell you this If your dad had metastases spread of the cancer on his liver the chances are good he had them elsewhere including the lungs A doctor once described cancer to me this way Its similar to starting a row of dominoes tumbling Once cells turn cancerous in one place they begin to turn cancerous in many other places in a domino effect That means your dad may have had metastases to his lungs and other vital organs as well as his liver How did the occur Well I cant tell you that exactly Gangrene is an infection and infections definitely can occur without any wounds Fluid buildup can cause an infection Gangrene may have been the cause of your fathers death but another likely culprit is  Sepsis occurs when an infection overwhelms the bodys immune system and shuts down all the organs Sepsis frequently is the cause of death in people with pneumonia and other conditions Im sorry you feel the hospital allowed your father to languish Im sorry he passed away I hope you are proud that he fought until the very end I wish I had answers for you I wish I could take the pain away I hope you know I sincerely share your pain over this loss My sympathy to you and your family Unfortunately its impossible to say what this might be without a physical exam Id say the most likely possibility is an  But only a medical professional conducting a physical exam can say for sure Less likely explanations are a sexually transmitted disease like and cancer Its also possible this is a cyst noncancerous or lipoma also noncancerous Id suggest you call your primary health care provider and have this looked at Take care I love this question Admittedly I dont share your belief that society will collapse and leave us without prescription medications However I am fascinated with the concepts of wilderness survival and survival themes in general Luckily doityourself thyroid replacement is not impossible Its not easy but its not impossible The original thyroid replacement hormone has been around for over a century It consists of dessicated pig thyroid You could make this yourself by harvesting the thyroid gland of a pig slicing it thinly then drying and crushing it into a powder Of course there would be no good way to determine the dosage of homemade dessicated pig thyroid You would simply have to monitor yourself for symptoms of high or low thyroid levels Good luck My short answer No Mobile health scans are a recent fad For a fee some organization will take a wholebody CT scan or some foolishness Its not beneficial for most people and it exposes you to a hefty dose of radiation In your case I think the question is Are you considering doing this for fear of lung cancer If so consult your primary care physician A simple chest Xray is a good starting point for diagnosing lung cancer And lung cancer isnt the only smokingrelated cancer Bladder cancer colon cancer and mouth cancers all are high on the list of cancers smokers experience I dont say that to scare you but merely to point out that shelling out 100 for a chest CT scan isnt necessarily a good option if youre concerned about smoking side effects Lets just be realistic for a moment Do you want to quit smoking At age 71 after 50 years of smoking its OK to say no You just need to understand you may be trading some life expectancy for your enjoyment of smoking If youre OK with that so be it On the other hand its never too late to quit If you have no signs of any cancers in your body and you wish to possibly extend your life expectancy talk to your health care provider about all the new options to help you quit smoking Two prescription medications in particular have good track records for helping people quit permanently Theres no shame in using a stopsmoking aid Quitting cold turkey is the least successful method I wish you all the best First let me say Im sorry to hear you or a loved one apparently has a salivary gland tumor Its always difficult to deal with a diagnosis of cancer I wish I could give you a straightforward answer but cancer staging just isnt straightforward Most tumors are evaluated using the TNM system TNM stands for Tumor Node cancer detected in the lymph nodes and Metastasis travel of the cancer to distant organs or locations In general a cancertumor that is referred to as Stage III means the tumor itself is a relatively large size and the cancer has spread to either the closest lymph node or to the adjacent tissue Your surgeon or oncologist cancer doctor should be able to give you detailed information about your specific tumor and the treatment options available The good news is this cancer is not Stage IV 4 which would mean the cancer had spread to distant organs Stage IV cancers can be difficult to treat I wish you all the best with this While its extremely rare to be allergic to Synthroid generic name levothyroxine that doesnt mean its impossible Synthroid is a brand name It contains certain binders and dyes that could conceivably cause an allergic reaction even though this medication has been used safely by millions of people Rest assured if it turns out you are allergic to something in Synthroid there are plenty of other options for you Generic versions of levothyroxine abound Your health care provider certainly can let you try different preparations to see which one works for you without causing an allergic reaction However its also possible something else entirely is causing your problems You should see your health care provider as soon as possible to try to determine what is causing your symptoms I hope you feel better soon This sounds like the description of a to me And it definitely deserves to be examined by a medical professional Pressure ulcers decubitus ulcers or bed sores in the elderly are not uncommon Left untreated they can become infected and cause serious illness A pressure ulcer generally isnt cause to run to the emergency room but Id certainly suggest you make an appointment with this ladys primary care provider to take a look at this Meanwhile it might help to or some layers of foam alternative to sit on This may help relieve the pressure thats causing this developing ulcer assuming thats what it is Please dont put any type of adhesive bandage on this or apply anything using adhesive tape This can cause tearing of the skin in elderly people I hope you get this checked out soon and I wish you and your loved one all the best First Im sorry to hear you have been diagnosed with  but Im glad to hear youre getting regular pap smears Unfortunately your partner may already be infected Even without external genital warts or other symptoms you can spread the virus through mere contact during sexual intercourse And use of a condom isnt necessarily protective either since a condom doesnt cover all the skin areas that may come in contact with the virus The good news is that serious complications or cancers from with healthy immune systems is rare In fact in both your cases the virus may clear up on its own over the course of a couple of years Though this is less likely if youre passing it back and forth Both you and your boyfriend should be alert for signs of genital warts on his penis or scrotum If you notice anything resembling genital warts he should try to see a doctor for a diagnosis Really the only way to diagnose HPV in men is through physical examination during an outbreak of the warts If you have additional questions about this dont hesitate to ask your gynecologist HPV is incredibly common Its estimated that up to 50 of sexually active men and women will contract HPV at some point in their lives Take care Im very sorry to hear about your boyfriends liver cancer That must be difficult for both of you to cope with In answer to your question here are the normal ranges you requested Magnesium 15  24 mEq Potassium 35  5 mEq Bilirubin  13 mgdL I hope you find that helpful Wishing you well Im sorry to hear youre going through this Unfortunately its not possible to diagnose what this lump might be without doing a physical examination The good news is its unlikely this lump is a cancer Its possible the lump is a cyst a lipoma noncancerous fatty tumor or an umbilical hernia I urge you to make an appointment to see your primary care provider for an exam This will help set your mind at ease and your provider will be able to recommend a treatment if necessary Hope this helps Im very sorry youre dealing with this especially at such a young age Unfortunately theres no good answer to your question The course of is different for every person Some people live many years with few symptoms Other people have rapidly progressive disease that takes their life fairly quickly My concern for you is twofold First why dont you want to treat this condition when youre just 25 years old You have your whole life ahead of you I could understand a 70yearold declining treatment But a young man This puzzles me Second your doctor should be more responsive He or she doesnt have the right to withhold information from you merely because you are choosing to decline treatment Id strongly suggest you get a second opinion or switch health care providers You deserve a doctor whos willing to partner with you in terms of assessing the form and severity of your disease Please assemble a supportive team of family and friends to help you make decisions as you go forward Im not suggesting youre incapable of making your own decisions Its just always good to have input from caring intelligent people who have your best interest at heart I wish you all the best as you navigate the course of this disease Im sorry to hear about your husbands skin cancer That can certainly be a scary experience and youre wise to keep a close watch on his skin from now on The cracking at the corner of your husbands mouth probably is not cancer but since hes had a skin cancer once it would be a good idea to get it checked out by a health care provider Often cracking at the corner of the mouth is a symptom of perleche or  This can be caused by a fungus which can be treated by your health care provider or by a Vitamin B deficiency However the symptom youre describing could be caused by many things including yes a cancer Thats why it would be best for your husband to be examined by your primary care provider He or she can diagnose the problem and treat it accordingly Good luck to you Im sorry to hear about your dads cancer but how lucky he is to have you to help him through this It sounds like youve been doing a great job managing your dads constipation As you know opioid narcotic pain medications can cause constipation The stool softeners were a good idea as was the MiraLax If the MiraLax was working but then caused diarrhea you may need to keep playing with how much and how often to use it in order to achieve the desired result If your dad is experiencing constipation you can give him the MiraLax even if it means youre off schedule with it Dont get stuck in a schedule if its not working Because your dad has colon cancer specifically and hes now experiencing problems with bowel movements it would be a good idea to make an appointment to see his health care provider This increase in constipation along with the cramping could be related to the disease progression and should be evaluated by his primary care provider or oncologist I wish you all the very best as you go through this journey Hang in there Im so sorry for you or your loved one with cancer Unfortunately I cant give you a good answer to your question Todays cancer drugs chemotherapy are usually a combination of medications that are designed specifically to treat an individual persons cancer So one person with cancer of the jaw might get a certain blend of chemotherapy drugs while someone else might get a different blend Only an oncologist cancer doctor can give you details about the specific treatment for this particular jaw cancer He or she also will be able to talk to you what to expect during the course of this cancer treatment and what the prognosis potential outcome is Im sorry I cant be more specific but I wish you all the best on this journey Hm Thats interesting Its not uncommon to develop numbness at the surgical site of any surgery Sometimes this is temporary and sometimes its permanent My question would be how extensive your skin cancer surgery was For example was it a small cancer the size of a pencil eraser perhaps and the surgeon just numbed it up took it off and closed up the incision with a couple of sutures Or was it a more extensive surgery possibly with general anesthesia and the doctor used a skin flap to close the wound A skin flap usually leaves a scar that has 3 or 4 lines or arms to it rather than just the single straight line of a single incision If your surgery was fairly extensive you might want to follow up on that tongue numbness Its not uncommon for a nerve to become irritated from extensive deep facial surgery but it would be pretty odd for this tongue numbness to be related to the surgery since its occurring so long after the fact Still it never hurts to check it out Hope this helps Im sorry youre going through this Unfortunately its impossible to diagnose something like this without a physical examination Id suggest you return to the doctor if possible the same one you saw last time Seeing the same doctor multiple times for the same ailment helps create an accurate history of the problem Also your health care provider can for example compare the size of the lesion now to its size when you were last seen This information can be valuable for coming to a diagnosis In answer to your question could it be cancerous again I have to say I dont know If the growth is inside your eyelid then Id say the chances are its not cancerous If the growth is on your eyelid such as within or below your lash line then Id say its slightly more possible this could be a cancer but overall not very likely Cancers of the eyelid arent all that common Your best bet is to return to your health care provider for a reevaluation Hope this helps Im sorry youre feeling worried about this Let me see if I can help First of all Id strongly recommend you discuss your concerns with your doctor He or she is in the best position to help get you on a course to lower your cholesterol and triglyceride numbers and get your blood sugar under better control Diet medications and a support group can all help in that effort Regarding the result of your  specifically Im not sure why a result of 90 would get flagged as high Usually the reference range for lipase runs between 1040 units per liter UL for adults under age 60 and between 18180 UL for adults over age 60 Even if your lipase results are abnormally high I wouldnt jump right to a conclusion of cancer Several conditions can cause elevated lipase numbers including inflammation of the pancreas pancreatitis gallbladder problems and peptic ulcers  just to name a few Your doctor is really the only person who can help you get an accurate diagnosis but I hope this response puts your mind at ease a bit Best wishes to you First let me say Im sorry to hear you or someone you love is suffering from lung cancer Thats a difficult diagnosis to cope with Its not uncommon to suffer from back pain due to lung cancer Please talk to your cancer doctor about the medication options available to you to relieve this pain Narcotic medications ranging from pills to patches may be prescribed for severe pain related to cancer On your own you might try a heating pad set to low for about 20 minutes at a time Do not place the heating pad directly against the skin because you could get burned Instead place a towel between the heating pad and your skin If that doesnt work you also may try an icepack Again no more than 20 minutes at a time and never directly touching the skin Sometimes the combination of heat and ice helps relieve pain The best solution is to speak with your cancer doctor about how to deal with this If the back pain is a new symptom your health care provider may want to run further tests to determine whats causing it Best wishes to you Hm Maybe Usually an will cause painful swelling redness and perhaps a visible pus pocket around the base of the tooth in the gum Often if you tap on an abscessed tooth it will cause a shocktype pain Abscessed teeth also are often very sensitive to cold and heat also can arise in the gums In fact oral cancers can arise anywhere within the mouth People who chew tobacco are at higher risk of developing an oral cancer that may mimic some of the symptoms of an abscessed tooth In general an oral cancer may present as a sore in your mouth that doesnt heal a thickening of a small portion of the gums or white or red patches on the gums If youre having oral pain or other symptoms Id suggest you see a dentist Whether the pain is caused by an abscessed tooth or by an oral cancer they both need to be treated Neither will clear up on its own Wishing you all the best I dont know of any studies that show products directly cause skin cancer These products can be purchased over the counter or obtained by prescription in a stronger formulation Alphahydroxy acid products are usually used to treat acne wrinkles and to generally improve the appearance of aging skin There are many different types of alphahydroxy acid products Some are applied as a cream while others are used as chemical peels usually done by a dermatologist You should talk to your dermatologist about the basal cell cancer issue to learn whether or not you should continue to use your face cream or not At any rate stay on top of your skin cancer is very common and not usually lethal but it does need to be treated Wishing you well Im sorry to hear your brotherinlaw and family are going through this especially during the holiday season Youre right that is rare And thats problematic in terms of predicting prognosis because study results for this disease often are based on small populations or even individual patients According to  the 5year survival rate for patients with earlystage localized disease negative lymph nodes is about 90 Thats not an entirely reliable number due to various statistical factors but it gives you something to go on In general with most cancers the less advanced it is the higher the success rate for chemotherapy and other treatments This may give you additional insight into how advanced his disease is I caution you though that this type of information can be hard for a lay person to interpret If you have any questions about it feel free to print this chart out and take it to the doctor with you to have it explained by a medical professional I wish you and your family all the best with this I wish I could give you a good answer but I dont think researchers have studied smoking at quite that micro a level In healthcare we measure smoking by the packyear We calculate this number based on the average number of packs smoked per day times the number of years the person has smoked For example a person who smokes one pack per day for 20 years has a 20 packyear history A person like yourself who smokes on average 20 cigarettes per week which calculates to roughly 015 pack per day for 20 years would have a roughly 3 packyear history  the same as a person who smoked one pack per day for three years Regardless of the manner in which you smoke a lot at one time or a few spread out over a longer period youre probably doing about the same amount of damage to your lungs and other vital structures Intuitively I would think the damage would be worse from smoking many cigarettes all at once as opposed to smoking the same number spread out over a greater length of time Rapidly introducing a volume of carcinogens and toxins probably is worse than trickling them in You sound wellinformed about the risks of smoking so Ill leave you with one little tidbit Did you know one of the morecommon cancers related to smoking is bladder cancer especially in men So the next time you light up ask yourself if you can envision the day when youll be emptying your urine through a pouch strapped to your thigh If not then you might want to rethink the whole smoking thing Wishing you well I wish I could give you a good answer but I dont think researchers have studied smoking at quite that micro a level In

is really the only person who can answer this question He or she is in the best position to evaluate the situation and come up with a treatment plan You didnt say how you came to have a chest xray that showed a spot on it but Im assuming it was ordered by a physician or nurse practitioner Any abnormal finding should be reported by the radiology department to the ordering physician but sometimes these communications dont go as smoothly as wed like If you have a concern about this spot on the xray or if you feel this finding was not communicated to your primary care provider your best bet is to make an appointment with him or her to discuss the xray results and work together to create a care plan that is best for you I hope this helps Best wishes to you Its always worrisome when a loved one is experiencing painful scary symptoms like your husbands In fact I always think its harder to cope with these things when its happening to my husband instead of me dont you So many conditions could cause the symptoms youre describing Thats why your husbands physician is having him undergo an  This test will help figure out whats going on so that you your husband and your physician can work together to put together a treatment plan Its also possible the endoscopy is just one of several tests your husbands health care provider will run before making a diagnosis It can be very hard to wait through all of this testing but hang in there Meanwhile remember to take care of your own health needs too As the caregiver youre under a tremendous amount of stress and you dont want to get sick Be sure to eat right drink plenty of fluids and maybe go for a walk when you can Try to get plenty of sleep Youll feel better and youll be in a strong position to see your husband through this health crisis Best wishes to you Im sorry youre going through this Its always nervewracking to get unexpected test results Mucus in the transverse colon is a normal finding Too much mucus in that area would be abnormal and would warrant further testing which is why youre having a CT scan today However this does not automatically mean you have cancer normally arises out of polyps which can be seen during the colonoscopy Several noncancerous conditions can cause excessive mucus in the transverse colon Your doctor will use the CT scan results to try to pinpoint what is causing this and whether or not it needs to be treated I hope all goes well for you today The most common sign of breast cancer is a  In addition the following are possible signs of breast cancer You should immidiately discuss these or any other findings that concern you with your health care professional Ovarian cancer occurs in approximately 1 in 18000 pregnancies Symptoms and signs are similar to those in the absence of pregnancy Typically an ovarian mass is found during an antepartum a routine prebirth checkup visit If it reverts to normal after several examinations and ultrasounds the diagnosis is usually a functional cyst which occur because of hormonal issues during pregnancy heres a couple sites to look at httpovariancanceraboutcomodovariancancerbasicsaOvCaPregnancyhtm httpwwwbabymedcomcancerovariancancerandpregnancy I am 59 years old and two years ago had hysterectamy for uterine cancer I did the bioidentical hormone therapy pellets a year before that There are no reliable screening tests \t\t for \t\t ovarian cancer  Some initial exams and \t\t tests are done before surgery if ovarian cancer is suspected These tests \t\t include Your \t\t\t medical history  to check what symptoms you have and \t\t\t what your chance of developing ovarian cancer is A physical exam  \t\t\t including a \t\t\t pelvic exam and \t\t\t Pap test  An ovarian lump may be felt during a pelvic \t\t\t exam A \t\t\t rectovaginal exam may also be done to feel the pelvic \t\t\t organs A \t\t\t complete blood count CBC  to check for \t\t\t anemia and other abnormal blood values A \t\t\t chemistry screen  to check for liver and kidney \t\t\t problems A \t\t\t human chorionic gonadotropin hCG level which may be \t\t\t done to rule out pregnancy or an \t\t\t ectopic pregnancy  A \t\t\t cancer antigen 125 CA125 level to measure a \t\t\t protein found on the surface of many ovarian cancer cells A \t\t\t pelvic and transvaginal ultrasound  to look for an \t\t\t ovarian lump More tests may be done before surgery to determine if other \t\t areas of the body are involved These tests include A pelvic or abdominal \t\t\t CT scan or \t\t\t MRI to check for the spread of cancer A \t\t\t chest Xray to check for the spread of cancer Surgery usually a \t\t laparotomy  is done to confirm that cancer is present \t\t to provide initial treatment and to \t\t stage the cancer For most women the United States Preventive \t\t\t Services Task Force USPSTF does not recommend having a CA125 blood test or a \t\t\t transvaginal ultrasound to find ovarian cancer early 11 \t\t\t There is no proof that having regular tests helps women live longer by finding \t\t\t ovarian cancer early Still experts recommend that women who have inherited a \t\t\t BRCA gene change and have not had their ovaries removed have a transvaginal \t\t\t ultrasound and a CA125 blood test at least once a year starting at age 35 \t\t\t Women who have inherited a BRCA1 gene change not a BRCA2 gene change may want \t\t\t to start having these regular tests as early as age 25 12 In some cases \t\t ovarian cancer may not cause early symptoms But most \t\t women do have symptoms even in the early stages The most common symptoms of \t\t ovarian cancer include 4 Recent frequent bloating  Pain in your belly or \t\t\t pelvis Difficulty eating or feeling full \t\t\t quickly Urinary problems such as an urgent need to urinate or \t\t\t urinating more often than usual If you have one or more of these symptoms and it occurs \t\t almost daily for more than 2 or 3 weeks talk with your doctor These symptoms are common for some women and they may not mean that you \t\t have ovarian cancer  But the early symptoms of ovarian cancer follow a specific \t\t pattern They start suddenly They feel different than your \t\t\t normal digestive or menstrual problems They happen almost every \t\t\t day and dont go away Other symptoms that affect some women with ovarian cancer \t\t include Fatigue  Indigestion Back \t\t\t pain Pain with \t\t\t intercourse Constipation  Menstrual cycle \t\t\t changes But these symptoms are also common in some women who dont \t\t have ovarian cancer Most abnormalities of the \t\t testes are found during a \t\t selfexamination or routine physical exam by a doctor \t\t If \t\t testicular cancer is suspected your doctor may want \t\t to perform other tests including Testicular ultrasound  This test may be \t\t\t used to rule out other possible causes of an enlarged or painful testicle \t\t\t before the testicle is removed Ultrasound is a test that uses reflected sound \t\t\t waves to produce an image of organs and other structures in the body Unlike \t\t\t many other imaging tests an ultrasound does not use Xrays or other types of \t\t\t possibly harmful radiation Blood tests which are often performed \t\t\t in order to measure the levels of tumor markers in your blood Tumor markers \t\t\t are substances that appear in your bloodstream when cancer is present Tumor \t\t\t marker levels are monitored at all stages of treatment for testicular cancer  \t\t\t Imaging tests such as \t\t\t chest Xray and \t\t\t CT scan of the chest abdomen and pelvis If the testicular ultrasound and blood tests suggest \t\t testicular cancer a doctor will surgically remove your affected testicle This \t\t procedure called a radical inguinal orchiectomy  is done to confirm a \t\t diagnosis of testicular cancer Following orchiectomy a \t\t pathologist will examine tissue from the testicle \t\t under a microscope  biopsy  If cancer is found you may \t\t have other imaging tests to see whether your cancer has spread beyond the \t\t testes The tests may be \t\t Xrays  \t\t CT scans  or \t\t MRIs of the abdomen chest and head Ongoing exams and tests During your \t\t treatment for testicular cancer your doctor will schedule a thorough followup \t\t program to monitor your recovery especially if you participate in a \t\t watchful waiting or surveillance program after your \t\t initial treatment These exams and tests may continue for several years \t\t following your treatment In addition to physical exams your specific \t\t followup program may include Periodic imaging tests such as chest Xrays or \t\t\t CT scans Blood tests to check the levels of tumor markers in your blood \t\t\t Tumor marker levels that are stable or increasing after youve had treatment \t\t\t may be a sign of more cancer Testicular selfexamination TSE \t\t\t may detect testicular cancer at an early stage Many testicular cancers are \t\t\t first discovered by selfexamination as a painless lump or an enlarged \t\t\t testicle Some doctors recommend that men between the ages of 15 \t\t\t and 40 perform monthly testicular selfexamination But this is controversial \t\t\t Many doctors do not believe monthly TSE is necessary for men who are at average \t\t\t risk for testicular cancer Monthly TSE may be recommended for men who are at \t\t\t high risk for testicular cancer This includes men with a history of an \t\t\t undescended testicle or a family or personal history of testicular \t\t\t cancer There are no proven ways to prevent \t\t testicular cancer  But the following steps may \t\t increase the possibility of finding earlystage testicular cancer when it is \t\t most likely to be curable Perform regular \t\t\t testicular selfexaminations TSE  Most cases of \t\t\t testicular cancer are discovered during a selfexam or during a routine \t\t\t physical done by a doctor Be aware of any pain or discomfort in \t\t\t your scrotum pelvis or lower back If you have any discomfort in these areas \t\t\t see your doctor as soon as possible For more information about testicular cancer see the \t\t following topics Testicular Cancer  Health Professional Information NCI PDQ Testicular Cancer  Patient Information NCI PDQ The most common symptoms of bowel cancer are bleeding from the back passagetiredness  weakness a change in bowel habit to normally looser stools but rarely sudden constipation and occasionally abdominal pain  The biggest thingis that the pathology is nonmalignant The main questions to ask your physician if you have not already would be whether he feels as though he got it all Additionally it might be worth asking if there was any dysplasia in the specimen Dysplasia just means that the cells look funny like they are changing in some way Asking these questions might allow you to have a bit more of a discussion with your physician so that you could feel better about the plan  Your question about whether your cancer will come back is a very common one It is also a question that is very hard to answer as there are many things that can influence the likelihood that your cancer will or will not return Most of my patients struggle with this question It sounds like you are undergoing aggressive treatmentchemoradiation followed by surgery followed by more chemo Each of these steps is aimed at keeping the cancer from coming back The radiationsurgery part really tries to target the local area while the chemo after surgery tries to target things that might be in other areas which is something we never know Following the advice of your physicians and making sure that you are followed both during and after your treatment are two things that you can do to add to everything else   It sounds great that your CEA is not changing and that your colonoscopy looks good These are exactly the things that we need to follow You ask a very good question about scans There is data coming out about the radiation risks associated with scans and it has made us think about how we follow patients I typically follow patients with scans for some period of time usually determined by the extent of their tumor The reason being is that we can detect any new diease early so that we can more easily address it It sounds as though you have not had a CT scan since your surgery If that is the case I think it would be reasonable to get one now that you are nearly 2 years from completing all your therapy It may be that this is the only one your oncologist will want to do I would also recommend discussing your fears about radiation with your physician as it may allow the two of you to come up with a plan that is comfortable for your both   The type of surgery for stomach cancer varies based on where the cancer is located and how extensive it is Sometimes the surgeon can remove part of the stomach partial gastrectomy and sometimes the surgeon needs to remove all of the stomach total gastrectomy In either case there is really not a patch or a transplant that is available at least to my knowledge After a stomach surgery there is a recovery time during which patients learn to eat with their new digestive system Some patients have more trouble than others but most learn to deal with the changes   If you need radiation it would be given every day except on weekends for a number of days that is determined by the dose of radiation that your physician feels that you need Typically we do give chemotherapy at the same time Sometimes though not all the time there is more chemotherapy after completion of chemoradiation  I am sorry to hear that your father has had so much chemotherapy With colon cancer it is not unusual for patients to develop problems with fluid Where does your father have the fluid I am assuming it is in his abdomen If this is the case there may be things that can be done to keep him more comfortable I would encourage youhim to talk to his doctor about what might be possible I recommend you get screened for diabetes Are you thirsty as well Good luck  bladder cancer is extremely rare in young adults especially as you have no blood in your urine If youre not drinking alcoholic beverages prior to bedtime then you may be drinking fluids too soon before bed Try not drinking anything 2  3 hours before going to bed Next time this occurs get screened for diabetes Good luck And just FYI I know this probablt sounds really stupid but I am asking this in all seriousnes Many of the largest studies to show no benefit for breast selfexam BSE were done in countries outside the US such as Shanghai China in 2002 and Russia in 2003 In addition to no decrease in breast cancer deaths the largest studies showed an increased number of biopsies which found no cancer It is difficult to know if the outcome would be the same if a woman was instructed using the newest BSE technique taught to gynecologists in the US The issues surrounding the clinical breast exams CBE done by doctors are similar There is a large Canadian study which suggested fiveyear survival rates were the same in women who received only CBE and those who received CBE plus screening mammogram One of the current discussions explores the quality of CBE There are several techniques used and some MDs do a more thorough and systemic breast exam than their colleagues In the most recent largest study metaanalysis of vitamin D calcium and the prevention of breast cancer both vitamin D and calcium seemed to be protective for the development of breast cancer The best results were among women with the highest intakes of vitamin D and calcium as compared to the lowest levels of consumption The top quarter of women having the highest blood 25OHD levels had a 45 decreased risk of breast cancer Another study of 562 women found that the 142 women with a diagnosed breast cancer had on average lower blood levels of 25OHD Women with the highest levels of 25OHD had a significantly reduced risk for breast cancer Surprisingly use of vitamin D supplements sunbathing and fish intake did increase blood levels of 25OHD  but the lifestyle factors did not directly impact the risk of breast cancer Conversely McCullough and colleagues studying almost 22000 women found no impact of blood levels of 25OHD on the risk of breast cancer A study of almost 42000 Swedish women did not identify linkages between breast cancer risk and sun exposure nor vitamin D intake through diet or multivitamin use The impact of vitamin D on ovarian cancer has not been as well studied but it has been purported to have a protective effect Researchers at the Channing Laboratory associated with Harvard University used data from four large studies to examine the effects of vitamin D on ovarian cancer It was determined that blood levels of vitamin D did not directly impact cancer risk from any of the four genotypes However a specific type of the vitamin D receptor gene was significantly tied to ovarian cancer risk Several studies have found that blood levels of 25OHD could be predictive of colon cancer risk More recently  investigators looked at both the risk for getting colon cancer and the ability to survive as it related to 25OHD blood levels among 1017 persons Participants in the top quarter of 25OHD levels as opposed to the lowest quarter had significantly less colon cancer They also had the lowest death rates from colon cancer and the lowest rates of overall mortality  It is important for women to know that breast cancer can be a mans disease as well This also means that a genetic link can come from a male relative Fortunately the symptom you describe is not likely to be linked to breast cancer risk It is not uncommon for women to be able to get small amounts of nipple discharge after having breastfed The usual triggers for this to occurs are nipple stimulation a a part of sexual foreplay hot showers birth control pills or checking for discharge by repeated squeezing Sometimes women will notice discharge from one or both nipples This prompts concern especially if she has not recently breast fed Generally we tell women that bilateral white or clear discharge  which is only present with nipple stimulation is likely to be normal As mentioned above being on birth control pills can sometimes enhance breast discharge Certain psychiatric medicationsespecially the antipsychotics can initiate nipple discharge Bilateral spontaneous secretions can be prompted by a pituitary problem or hypothyroidism Both low thyroid and elevated prolactin from the pituitary gland can be checked for using simple blood tests The most concerning nipple discharges are those which are redbloody unilateral and coming from just one or two ducts If you were my patient I would check a sample of the discharges for undiscernable blood using the fecal blood card I would do a careful breast exam and might send you for a mammogram or ultrasounddepending upon your age I prefer to be safe rather than sorryeven when the discharge sounds nonpathologic So get it checked out even though it is likely that you will be told it is OK Weight is a really important factor to the postmenopausal woman Higher body mass index and postmenopausal weight gain increase a womans risk for breast cancer A woman who has a BMI of more than 33 is 27 more likely to get breast cancer than a woman with a BMI of less than 21 Losing about 22 pounds will lower your risk Regular physical activity can help women protect themselves from breast cancer Engaging in say fast walking for 10 hours or more per week can benefit women immensely Drinking alcohol has definitely been shown to be a risk factor and the more one drinks the higher the risk I always say one drink is good for the heart but two drinks are bad for your breasts Other factors that seem to help decrease the risk eating olive oil sticking to a lowfat diet that includes monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats complex carbohydrates and minimal red meat Taking Vitamin D and CoQ10 may also help lower your risk Soy is still controversial so I advise eating no more than what is in a standard Asian diet  20 grams per day Breastfeeding for a least six months may decrease breast cancer risk With every 12 months of breastfeeding a reduction of 43 was seen for breast cancer risk Finally if a woman can control for this she should try to have a baby at a younger age Having a first baby before age 25 will decrease a womans risk by 10 and having a baby before 35 decreases her risk by 5 Unfortunately having a first baby later in life puts a woman at greater risk for breast cancer because of perimenopausal breast changes from hormones of pregnancy Regular physical activity protects against CRC We can reduce our risk by as much as 24 if we just get up and get moving Aspirin and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs also protect against CRC Statins medication that lowers cholesterol may affect CRC in a positive way Postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy was shown in the Womens Health Initiative study to reduce the incidence of CRC Dietary calcium magnesium fish oils and vitamin B6 all have positive effects in reducing CRC And nonherbal tea and possibly coffee a diet high in fruits and vegetables and low in red and processed meats may all be protective against CRC Antioxidants folic acid and a diet high in fiber have not been shown to aid in preventing cancer of the colon and rectum But the following have been shown to increase our risk obesity alcohol cigarette smoking diabetes and being insulin resistant Drinking more than 45 grams per day of alcohol increases a persons life risk for colorectal cancer If a persons body mass index BMI is over 25 there is a 15 fold increase in their risk Researchers also noted an increase in incidence of CRC and death from CRC if a person smoked And in another study that compared those with diabetes and nondiabetics the risk of CRC was 30 higher for the diabetic group Another factor that increases a persons risk for CRC is inflammatory bowel disease such as ulcerative colitis or Crohns disease Inflammation throughout the GI tract may be the culprit which explains why aspirin and antiinflammatory drugs seem to protect against CRC Finally if you have a family history of colorectal cancer you must be observed closely by your doctor If you are diagnosed with colon polyps or have family members diagnosed with colorectal cancer before 55 years of age you should begin aggressive surveillance Hi First you should know what causes cancer One of the major things is tobacco smoking or genetic mutation from your DNA Throat cancer can be caused by the human papilloma virus HPV In 2008 researchers from Duke MD Anderson UNC U Michigan and NCI published their findings on the use of flaxseed supplementation as a nutritional preventive intervention for prostate cancer  According to this study ground flaxseed is safe and associated with biological alterations that may be protective for prostate cancer  Goodnewsbadnews The LHRH agonist Lupron is one brand is critical to the success of prostate cancer treatment for many men and sounds like it was effective along with the brachytherapy in your husbands case The bad news is the potential for side effects In this case he needs a serum free and total testosterone level to determine if the level is still low for his age Giving back testosterone in the form of shots or rub on gels could raise his T level but might increase the chance of a cancer recurrence Discuss this with your doctor A lot would depend on the PSA level should be very low and the digital rectal exam should have a very flat prostate with no nodules to allow the possibility of T replacement As far as the penis side effects he could get a prescription for a vacuum erection device VED to stretch and exercise his penis to try to restore the length and size The VED can also be used with other treatments for erectile dysfunction ED such as ViagraCialisLevitra MUSE Caverject etc He could see a urologist who specializes in treatments for ED for more details  A TURP stands for transurethral resection of the prostate It is a procedure done through the penisurethra where the urologist uses an instrument called a resectascope to remove prostate tissue that may be blocking the urinary chanel It is the gold standard urologic surgery to relieve urinary obstruction from a prostate gland that is enlarged and blocking urinary flow out of the bladder Most boardcertified urologists are expert at this procedure as it is one of the common operations that urologists frequenty perform Whether it should be done prior to radiation for prostate cancer is dependent on a number of factors 1 If your Dad has a lot of urinary symptoms such as hesitancy small stream and poor flow he may benefit from a TURP 2 If the urologist measures a high residual urine in the bladder after voiding then a TURP may be needed 3 If there are other complicating factors such as bladder stones or bleeding from an enlarged prostate then he may need a TURP In general his urologist should explain to your Dad why he thinks a TURP is needed On the other hand most men do not rountinely need a TURP before external beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer As far as when the cancer is gone it may take 1824 months for the radiation to clear the cancer from your prostate gland The PSA should go down to a very low number The best results are when the PSA goes to less than 02ngml Certainly if the PSA does not fall to below 05ngml by 2 years this may mean the brachytherapy did not work completely If your PSA does not drop to these low levels you may need another prostate biopsy but this should not generally be done until after 1824 months There is also something called PSA bounce where the PSA can temporarily bump up after brachytherapy This is important because if this happens in the first 2 years you should not worry about cancer returning right away and wait out the PSA bounce and usually it falls back down In general brachytherapy is a good choice for men in their 70s   You could do intermittent hormonal therapy IHT and hold off on further hormones until your PSA goes higher and then plan to just take 69 months of shots to drive the PSA lower then stop again Also you could do peripheral androgen blockade PAD with oral only hormone medicines like bicalutamide or flutamide with or without finasteride or dutasteride In the future there may be other good alternative options to the hormonal shots There are multiple new hormonal pills under development in clinical trials that look quite promising Some of them include aberaterone MDV3100 and TAK700   Traditionally it was felt that testosterone T replacement in men who had low T called hypogonadism would increase the risk for prostate cancer More recently it has been suggested that it may be better for a man to have a normal T to maintain an average or lower risk for prostate cancer in the future Dr Abe Morgantaller a noted urology expert in this area and a friend of mine who works in Boston has written a lot about this In your case even though you seem to have a strong family history of prostate cancer it may be very reasonable to give you supplemental T to get your levels to normal You should see a urologist or an endocrinologist for your specific case In addition to a normal PSA which you currently have the doctor should do a digital rectal exam DRE before starting you on T replacement to make sure this prostate screening is also normal The current most popular way to replace T is with topical gels Androgel or Testim that are rubbed on the skin of the shoulders or upper back or chest daily I say dont lose hope I know people who have been diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and have actually gone into remission after it was spread through their whole body I am a firm believer that emotional health has a ton to do with physical health so keep her in good spirits I work with prostate cancer patients Muscle pain is not associated with the prostate cancer primarily it is more bone pain when the cancer has metastasized Muscle fatigue is a symptom with certain treatments of prostate cancer This is a great question Luckily Medicare provides a great web site for folks to check out whats covered and what isnt covered in its list of medications or formulary Check out wwwmedicaregov and click Formulary Finder 2010 Plan Data and then select your state of residence in the dropdown menu Then type in the medication you wish to learn about Well I have to say when the WHI study came out in 2002 it was insane what they did with this research and how they presented it to women I remember I was dealing with WebMD at that point and coming on line and talking to all the women and telling them not to stop their hormones if anything to switch over to the natural progesterone But what had happened was the study was really done on synthetic hormones and women who started 10 years after the fact always my recommendation to women when they go on hormone replacement therapy they do it around the perimenopause when they are having the maximum symptoms that they take it for menopausal symptoms and they take the least amount they need to control their symptoms and for the shortest amount of time that they need to take it so that they are not getting into twenty years down the line of continuous hormonal replacement therapy and getting into trouble with breast cancer You can get breast cancer from anything I mean nobody knows what causes breast cancer but bioidentical hormones are still hormones They are still estrogen And women think they are not going to get you know a risk from taking bioidentical hormones because they are bioidentical Thats not true its estrogen its testosterone its progesterone Women have to be watched for uterine and breast cancer but again we dont want to take it long term Yeah its quite right Yes most of the medical care you need to treat cancer is covered by Medicare including doctor visits hospital stays medication and medical treatment for conditions and side effects of cancer You can check more details related to your specific needs at Medicaregov The only way to know for certain whether the particular therapy your doctor is prescribing will be covered by insurance is to check with your insurer directly Its probably best to get your doctors office involved here to make sure the specifics of the treatment are clearly communicated to avoid surprise bills down the line Generally Medicare covers the treatment for prostate cancer However Im not sure this particular treatment has been approved for use in the United States If thats the case it likely wont be covered by Medicare I would get it removed as soon as possible especially with your family history If you shave your armpits it could be from that You can read more about Provenge here httpbitly12E55g5 Studies showing soy may increase cancer risk have been found mainly in animal studies The research on people does not tell the same story According to a recent research women who consume soy have a lower risk of cancer recurrence The 2012 American Cancer Society Guidelines on Nutrition and Physical Activity for Cancer Survivors report no harmful effects from cancer survivors eating soy in moderation But they do not recommend supplements which contain higher isoflavone content According to these organizations enjoy soy every once and a while and you should be fine For more about how much see this WebMD article  Krill oil a rich source of omega 3 fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid DHA and eicosapentaenoic acid EPA plays a key role in a healthy diet According to the American Cancer Society there is some research that fish oils with these omega 3 fatty acids such as krill oil decrease the rate of cancer cell growth but not all studies agree The most evidence for the benefits of fish oil is improving heart health including risk factors such as high triglycerides Always check with your healthcare provider about taking supplements during cancer treatment For more on the benefits of Krill oil see this WebMD article httpwwwwebmdcomvitaminssupplementsingredientmono1172KRILL20OILaspxactiveIngredientId1172activeIngredientNameKRILL20OIL According to the American Cancer Societys website Common symptoms of breast cancer include A change in how the breast or nipple feels A change in how the breast or nipple looks Nipple discharge fluid Early breast cancer usually does not cause pain Still a woman should see her health care provider about breast pain or any other symptom that does not go away Most often these symptoms are not due to cancer Other health problems may also cause them Any woman with these symptoms should tell her doctor so that problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible  Symptoms of colon cancer are numerous and nonspecific They include fatigue weakness shortness of breath change in bowel habits narrow stools diarrhea or constipation red or dark blood in stool weight loss abdominal pain cramps or bloating Other conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome spastic colon ulcerative colitis Crohns disease diverticulosis and peptic ulcer disease can have symptoms that mimic colorectal cancer Colon cancer can be present for several years before symptoms develop Symptoms vary according to where in the large bowel the tumor is located The right colon is spacious and cancers of the right colon can grow to large sizes before they cause any abdominal symptoms Typically rightsided cancers cause iron deficiency anemia due to the slow loss of blood over a long period of time Iron deficiency anemia causes fatigue weakness and shortness of breath The left colon is narrower than the right colon Therefore cancers of the left colon are more likely to cause partial or complete bowel obstruction Cancers causing partial bowel obstruction can cause symptoms of constipation narrowed stool diarrhea abdominal pains cramps and bloating Bright red blood in the stool may also indicate a growth near the end of the left colon or rectum The initial symptoms the clinical presentations of liver cancer are variable It is becoming much more common for patients to be identified by screening people at high risk for the cancer and finding the cancer before there are any symptoms at all In countries where liver cancer is very common the cancer generally is discovered at a very advanced stage of disease for several reasons For one thing areas where there is a high frequency of liver cancer are generally developing countries where access to health care is limited For another screening examinations for patients at risk for developing liver cancer are not available in these areas In addition patients from these regions may actually have more aggressive liver cancer disease In other words the tumor usually reaches an advanced stage and causes symptoms more rapidly In contrast patients in areas of low liver cancer frequency tend to have liver cancer tumors that progress more slowly and therefore remain without symptoms longer There are no specific symptoms of liver cancer and in fact the earliest signs are usually subtle and can be mistaken for simple worsening of cirrhosis and liver function Abdominal pain is uncommon with liver cancer and usually signifies a very large tumor or widespread involvement of the liver Additionally unexplained weight loss or unexplained fevers are warning signs of liver cancer in patients with cirrhosis These symptoms are less common in individuals with liver cancer in the US because these patients are usually diagnosed at an earlier stage However whenever the overall health of a patient with cirrhosis deteriorates every effort should be made to look for liver cancer A common initial presentation of liver cancer in a patient with compensated cirrhosis meaning that there are no complications of liver disease is the sudden onset of a complication For example the sudden appearance of ascites abdominal fluid and swelling jaundice yellow color of the skin or muscle wasting without causative precipitating factors for example alcohol consumption suggests the possibility of liver cancer Whats more the cancer can invade and block the portal vein a large vein that brings blood to the liver from the intestine and spleen When this happens the blood will travel paths of less resistance such as through esophageal veins This causes increased pressure in these veins which results in dilated widened veins called esophageal varices The patient then is at risk for hemorrhage from the rupture of the varices into the gastrointestinal tract Rarely the cancer itself can rupture and bleed into the abdominal cavity resulting in bloody ascites On physical examination an enlarged sometimes tender liver is the most common finding Liver cancers are very vascular containing many blood vessels tumors Thus increased amounts of blood feed into the hepatic artery artery to the liver and cause turbulent blood flow in the artery The turbulence results in a distinct sound in the liver hepatic bruit that can be heard with a stethoscope in about onequarter to onehalf of patients with liver cancer Any sign of advanced liver disease for example ascites jaundice or muscle wasting means a poor prognosis Rarely a patient with liver cancer can become suddenly jaundiced when the tumor erodes into the bile duct The jaundice occurs in this situation because both sloughing of the tumor into the duct and bleeding that clots in the duct can block the duct In advanced liver cancer the tumor can spread locally to neighboring tissues or through the blood vessels elsewhere in the body distant metastasis Locally liver cancer can invade the veins that drain the liver hepatic veins The tumor can then block these veins which results in congestion of the liver The congestion occurs because the blocked veins cannot drain the blood out of the liver Normally the blood in the hepatic veins leaving the liver flows through the inferior vena cava which is the largest vein that drains into the heart In African patients the tumor frequently blocks the inferior vena cava Blockage of either the hepatic veins or the inferior vena cava results in a very swollen liver and massive formation of ascites In some patients as previously mentioned the tumor can invade the portal vein and lead to the rupture of esophageal varices Regarding distant metastases liver cancer frequently spreads to the lungs presumably by way of the bloodstream Usually patients do not have symptoms from the lung metastases which are diagnosed by radiologic Xray studies Rarely in very advanced cases liver cancer can spread to the bone or brain These are an infrequent problem in many patients who do not live long enough to develop these complications Screening tests are those that are done at regular intervals to detect a disease such as prostate cancer at an early stage If the result of a screening test is normal the disease is presumed not to be present If a screening test is abnormal the disease is then suspected to be present and further tests usually are needed to confirm the suspicion that is to make the diagnosis definitively Prostate cancer usually is suspected initially because of an abnormality of one or both of the two screening tests that are used to detect prostate cancer These screening tests are a digital rectal examination and a blood test called the prostate specific antigen PSA In the digital rectal examination the doctor feels palpates the prostate gland with his gloved index finger in the rectum to detect abnormalities of the gland Thus a lump irregularity or hardness felt on the surface of the gland is a finding that is suspicious for prostate cancer Accordingly doctors usually recommend doing a digital rectal examination in men age 40 and over The PSA test is a simple reproducible and relatively accurate blood test It is used to detect a protein the prostate specific antigen that is released from the prostate gland into the blood The PSA level is usually higher than 4ngmL in people with prostate cancer than in people without the cancer Situations of large prostate size infection and inflammation are other reasons why the PSA may be elevated The PSA therefore is valuable as a screening test for prostate cancer Accordingly doctors usually recommend doing a PSA in men age 40 and over Subsequent screening is recommended based on individual preference and assessment of risk for developing prostate cancer For example patients with a high risk of developing prostate cancer due to a family history or a high initial PSA should have more frequent evaluation usually annually Although still considered controversial most urologists recommend regular screening for prostate cancer in men who are likely to live for more than 10 years The American Urological Association AUA issued their latest guidelines for prostate cancer in 2009 According to these men at the age of 40 should be offered a baseline PSA test and a prostate exam digital rectal exam or DRE to ascertain the risk of prostate cancer Subsequent screening and tests may be performed according to the findings on this initial evaluation and an individuals risk of getting the disease on the basis of other factors such as race ethnicity and family history of prostate cancer As mentioned most urologists currently would advise some form of screening in men with a life expectancy greater than 10 years Most frequently it would be performed on an annual basis Although there is no definite cutoff age to stop prostate cancer screening most physicians would rarely screen men more than 75 years of age for this disease Results of the PSA test under 4 nanograms per milliliter of blood are generally considered normal There is a recent trend however to perform prostate biopsy in all patients with a PSA more than 25 ngml in order to detect prostate cancer at an earlier and hopefully completely curable stage The American Urological Association guidelines 2009 do not define a definite cutoff point but advise that all the other risk factors for prostate cancer should be taken into account while making a decision on whether to proceed for a biopsy One of the important factors that needs to be considered is the rate at which the PSA value has increased over time on repeated measurements PSA velocity Results between 4 and 10 are considered borderline These borderline values are interpreted in the context of the patients age symptoms signs family history and changes in the PSA levels over time Results higher than 10 are considered abnormal suggesting the possibility of prostate cancer It has been shown that the higher the PSA value the more likely the diagnosis of prostate cancer Moreover the level of PSA tends to increase when the cancer has progressed from organconfined prostate cancer to local spread to distant metastatic spread Very high values such as 30 or 40 and over are usually caused by prostate cancer In the early stages prostate cancer often causes no symptoms for many years As a matter of fact these cancers frequently are first detected by an abnormality on a blood test the PSA or as a hard nodule lump in the prostate gland Occasionally the doctor may first feel a hard nodule during a routine digital done with the finger rectal examination The prostate gland is located immediately in front of the rectum Rarely in more advanced cases the cancer may enlarge and press on the urethra As a result the flow of urine diminishes and urination becomes more difficult Patients may also experience burning with urination or blood in the urine As the tumor continues to grow it can completely block the flow of urine resulting in a painfully obstructed and enlarged urinary bladder These symptoms by themselves however do not confirm the presence of prostate cancer Most of these symptoms can occur in men with noncancerous benign enlargement of the prostate the most common form of prostate enlargement However the occurrence of these symptoms should prompt an evaluation by the doctor to rule out cancer and provide appropriate treatment Furthermore in the later stages prostate cancer can spread locally into the surrounding tissue or the nearby lymph nodes called the pelvic nodes The cancer then can spread even farther metastasize to other areas of the body Symptoms of metastatic disease include fatigue malaise and weight loss During a rectal examination the doctor can sometimes detect local spread into the surrounding tissues That is the physician can feel a hard fixed not moveable tumor extending from and beyond the gland Prostate cancer usually metastasizes first to the lower spine or the pelvic bones the bones connecting the lower spine to the hips thereby causing back or pelvic pain The cancer can then spread to the liver and lungs Metastases areas to which the cancer has spread to the liver can cause pain in the abdomen and jaundice yellow color of the skin in rare instances Metastases to the lungs can cause chest pain and coughing I am very sorry to hear that your Mother is so sick From your question it sounds like she is still in the hospital Before she is sent home ask her if you can talk to the doctor who is taking care of her You will need her permission for the doctors and nurses to talk to you about her illness This is to protect her privacy Have a list of questions ready to ask the doctor Depending on your Moms health you might want answers to some of the following questions \tIs there any special diet that she will be on If so can you talk to a dietitian \tWill you need any special equipment at home to help take care of your Mom like a bedside commode or hospital bed \tWill homecare nurses be coming out to help her \tWill she be in any pain and if so what can you do to help her \tWill she be having any further treatments \tWhat can you and your mom expect over the next several days or weeks When should you call the doctor \tIs she on any new medication If so how does she take it and are there any side effects \tWould hospice care be appropriate at this time \tAre there any support groups for cancer patients and their families in the area Hopefully you will get all the answers that you both need Your Mother is very lucky to have someone like you to be her advocate This is a little complicated I think it will help to go over the terms that doctors use for female pelvic surgery A hysterectomy is the surgical removal of your uterus A total hysterectomy means that the entire uterus and cervix are removed Having a hysterectomy does not increase your chances of getting breast cancer A complete hysterectomy is a nonmedical term that is sometimes used to refer to surgery that removes the uterus as well as the ovaries and tubes Removing the ovaries can reduce your risk for breast cancer If your ovaries are removed oophorectomy along with your uterus your doctor may suggest hormone replacement therapy This is usually estrogenonly rather than combination therapy According to the American Cancer Society this type of estrogenonly replacement does not increase the risk for breast cancer In fact it appears to decrease the risk I hope this answers your question Here is a WebMD article that discusses some recent research concerning hormone replacement after hysterectomy and breast cancer risk Uterine or endometrial cancer can have a tendency to run in families But that does not mean that you will definitely get it just because your Mother had it Changes in your menstrual cycle including heavy bleeding or spotting between periods can be a sign of uterine cancer But it can also be caused by some other conditions as well Other possible symptoms of uterine cancer include nonbloody vaginal discharge pelvic pain unintentional weight loss and feeling of a mass in the pelvis You need to make an appointment with your gynecologist as soon as possible The earlier uterine cancer is found the greater the chances that it can be successfully treated Talk to your gynecologist about your family history and changes in your periods She will likely want to take a tissue sample with either an endometrial biopsy or a DC  She might also suggest a transvaginal ultrasound to look at the uterus Then you can find out what is causing your symptoms and get the right treatment You can read more about endometrial cancer on WebMD Based on the description I am not sure why you are assuming gallbladder cancer since it is quite rare Maybe the doctor indicated that was a concern Ultrasound results are available quickly so I wouldnt let that part worry you However unintentional weight loss is a concern and Im glad that her doctor is getting to the bottom of whats going on To answer your specific question gallbladder cancer is not common and fewer than 10000 people are diagnosed with it every year including cancers of the gallbladder bile ducts It is usually found fairly late because its often advanced by the time someone has significant syptoms If its found early which happens in about 1 in 5 people there is the possibility to cure it But even if it cant be cured treatment can definitely help prolong life what is stringy blood clots when I urinate i am having some chest pain as well it started with swelling about a week ago and the pain seems to be getting worse everyday my breast is burning and feels very heavy i am more tired than usual and my armpit is sore also Smoking contributes to the death of approximately 500000 people each year from heart disease stroke and cancer Smoking tobacco is not known to have any definite effects on seizure control But persons with epilepsy are not only susceptible to all the usual effects of smoking but also are at increased risk of injury or death from fire No Tongue Cancer is called  Nasopharyngeal carcinoma Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is cancer that occurs in the nasopharynx which is located behind the nose and above the back of the throat The nasopharynx is the upper portion of the pharynx  a 5inch tube that extends from behind the nose to the top of the windpipe and esophagus in your neck Signs and symptoms of nasopharyngeal carcinoma may include  A lump in the neck caused by a swollen lymph node  Bloody discharge from the nose  Nasal congestion on one side of your nose  Hearing loss in one ear  Frequent ear infections  Headaches  Double vision  Face and

from the UKs NHS The medical term for having one or two undescended testicles is unilateral or bilateral cryptorchidism How undescended testicles are treated In most cases the testicles will move down into the scrotum naturally during the first three to six months of the babys life If the testicles do not descend by this time treatment is usually recommended This is because boys with undescended testicles may have fertility problems in later life and an increased risk of developing testicular cancer  although this risk is still very small If treatment is recommended this will usually involve an operation called an orchidopexy to move the testicles into the correct position inside the scrotum This is a relatively straightforward operation with a good success rate Surgery is usually carried out before your child is two years old If the condition is treated at an early age the boys fertility should be unaffected In a small number of cases it may be possible to use artificial hormones to stimulate the descent of the testicles But the only thing is that your now 55 Been trying to find anything that will help you lots of medical stuff but not for a 55 year old man most of it is aimed at young boys Have you thought of going an seeing a URO for help and information and to see what can be done for you Do hope this helps in some way Good Luck Hi So you were doing the right thing by

reading also tends to rise as men get older If your PSA is only slightly raised you may have an enlarged prostate but not cancer Your doctor is likely to ask you if you have any symptoms that might indicate a possible prostate cancer These include problems passing urine weight loss low back pain blood in the urine and problems getting an erection impotence A PSA level that is high for a persons age means a doctor should make an urgent referral to a specialist for further investigations These include a transrectal ultrasound and a needle biopsy of the prostate A biopsy means taking a small sample of tissue to examine This is the only sure way to diagnose prostate cancer If cancer cells are seen in the biopsy sample when it is looked at under a microscope there is proof of cancer

the Wall Street Journal wrote a comprehensive piece on the discovery of the 24 different types of prostate cancer The Prostate Cancer Foundation heavily funded the research behind the reported discoveries at the University of Michigan and Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center These findings bring us one step closer to discovering cures for these prostate cancers Key findings from the article include This data will result in better cancerspecific diagnostics that will enable medical professionals to cure more and over treat lessan important goal in treating prostate cancer patients and in the overall quality of healthcare Prostate Cancer Foundation funded research led to the identification of 24 gene fusions discussed in the Wall Street Journal piece Though we dont have a cure for prostate cancer yet PCF funded research has gotten us one step closer Identifying these fusions will soon enable physicians and clinicians to distinguish between aggressive and nonaggressive prostate cancers and prescribe targeted treatments OR proactive surveillance for patients The identification of these fusions provides a roadmap to research the engines of these various types of prostate cancer and the ability to develop new targeted medicines New treatments are already on the horizon with the financial backing of the Prostate Cancer Foundation I hope this is what your

prolonged period of time then low likelihood Infrared lasers dont have a very high frequency so their radiation isnt dangerous theyre actually behind visible light on the electromagnetic spectrum I was very sick the same way Turned out my gallbladder was not working correctly I would have that checked Of course it does And the irradication also causes two other cancers to appear years later leucemia and or lymphoma Radiation treatment is guarenteed to take a life where as the cancer that the radiation was meant to destoy may or may not take the cancer victums life Irradicate certain to die a very harsh death OR be a cancer survivor no matter how long or how short a life it may be that God blesses you to have and enjoy Easy choice isnt it My mom is diagnosed with this and her symptoms were tiredness sharp pain on left side bloating and blood in her stools Yes Protected sex always Even with oral sex for your partner that is him doing you There has been a significant increaase of Oral Cancers in kmales related to HPV transmission And you partner needs to be informed if you decide you want to reproduce and go unprotected Could be many reasons Lack or insifficient lubrication which can be corrected with increased foreplay or an artificial lubricant It could also be the size of your partner which again is corrected by increased foreplay lubrication and taking it slowthe ambience is a major factor if its the size because you need to be relaxed and you will stretch Then there is always the possiblity that you have a medical issue and need to have that ruled out by your gynecologist But I would try romancing first being that this is not life threatening Environmental factors cause the genetic mutations in most pancreatic cancer cases However in some families inherited genetic factors do play a role About 510 of cases are considered familial or hereditary For information about early detection and risk factors contact the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network at 8772726226 My husband is in the same condition He was diagnosed in 2013 and has gone through radiation chemo 5FU and a clinical trial Nothing stopped the cancer from spreading to his liver He will begin his last chemo treatments on Monday Gemzar and Abraxane The side effects of the Abraxane could render him totally helpless in which case he promised me he would stop all treatment He was told that with treatment he could live another 6 months or a year The oncologist told him that a year would be rare My prayers are with you as I know that prayers have been coming my way for a year and a half now Treasure every moment you have left Celebrate life rather than dwell on the impending death God Bless Heres my opinion based upon what you posted and upon the intuitive feel I have developed toward A cancerrelated issues and B the medical profession and its largely startlingly casual attitude toward cancer PLEASE DO NOT WAIT If you had those test results without the strong family history it MIGHT be borderline whether you should wait and take the less aggressive approach your provider suggests But even then I dont like the sound and trend of all that data And you add in the strong family history without question it tips the balance well over into the Do It Right Now Never Mind That Waiting Nonsense Territory If youre having difficulty persuading your provider to move forward my advice would be to do what Ive had to learn to do in recent years with my own taught by my cousins husband a wonderful pioneer in patient advocate instruction schedule a meeting and prepare some questions beforehand and if at all possible have someone come right in with you to meet your doctor this person could be family member friend lifepartner advocate even clergy just someone you feel you can really trust who will pay attention to nonverbal cues as well as generally remembering the trend of the conversation and providing another pair of ears in addition to whatever level of backing you up and helping speak up for you that YOU feel you need if youre good at speaking up for yourself you may want to instruct whomever goes with you to let me do the talking here okay I just need you to Whatever works best for you But I do advise bringing someone in with you I know youre well into young adulthood but this kind of support in situations like this is necessary for people of all ages My 50yearold cousin owns this boarding Homestead and is MENSAsmart but she sometimes has needed her husband or other persons to accompany her to difficult appointments for the same reason Theres no shame in it Indeed it can be lifesaving in the long run So once at your providers office the best thing for you to do is to go over all those salient details you posted here Then ask pointedly but very politely of course what justifies a decision to wait given your strong family history added to the mix If you get any kind of answer that smacks of Im the doctor and you dont need to know why Im doing it this way or even anything like I think youre overreacting and you may be a bit of a hypochondriac into the bargain then Im not going to mince words YOU HAVE A SERIOUS PROBLEM and need to arrange a second opinion and even possibly a transfer of care to another doctor pronto That kind of attitude in a physician is bad news no matter what the health issue I know from experience BUT if you get a response that is more reasonable but still reluctant to take action you and your advocate need to stand firm and say Look Ill level with you Doc I just cannot get behind this watchful waiting thing Not with my family history Im not hysterical you can see that Im not yelling and Im thinking clearly and rationally So this isnt an emotional abreaction Im adamant I believe firmly that this needs to be done now not three months from now Will we be able to move ahead together on that basis My further advice is this if your provider says yes do it If not please immediately seek a second opinion Good Luck Yes It can last a long time Try stopping your urine stream while urinating This will strengthen your muscles in that area I think so because all rare edible vegetables has a mystical health benefits Hearing the diagnosis of cancer is quite simply a shock to the system The first reaction is often panic followed by a tidal wave of emotions How can this be Why me Im scared and not able to handle this But handle it you must The following is a list of essential things that anyone newly diagnosed with cancer should know 1 Understand the diagnosis There are many different types of cancer even within the same broad category For example breast cancer has three general categories hormone receptor positive for the estrogen andor progesterone receptors Her2 positive and triple negative hormone receptors and Her2 are negative or not present the three types are often treated very differently Nearly every type of cancer has different subtypes and it is important to know which one you have 2 Do not jump the gun and think the worst Not all cancers of the same type act the same Some bad cancers may be curable Get all the facts straight and get them only from the experts who treat the disease not from physicians who are not cancer experts and not from wellmeaning friends and family who know someone with 3 Meet first with local specialists What other tests are needed to fully determine the stage or extent of the cancer in the body Do you need surgery chemotherapy andor radiation Have these questions answered first in your community near where you live or work Physicians that specialize in treating cancer have been highly trained whether they practice in a community setting or at a large medical center Since cancer treatment may not be a one shot deal but can involve six months or more of therapy it is important to make these treatments as convenient and safe as possible Having a good cancer center close to home can make a world of difference 4 Consider a second opinion The need for a second opinion depends on the quality of the first opinions you receive and on your preferences as a patient Do not think that the grass is greener elsewhere and that an incurable cancer is curable at a more heavily advertised center If the cancer specialists in your area have an excellent reputation and you like their approach to you and your cancer then you may not feel that another opinion is necessary On the other hand if you feel that surgery is better performed at a high volume center for example or you just want the peace of mind that comes with confirmation of treatment recommendations then a second opinion is right for you The best doctors do not dissuade patients from seeking other opinions nor from receiving cancer care close to home when that is more convenient Once you have dealt with the shock of a cancer diagnosis you will need to be as organized as possible in order to make your cancer journey as livable as possible Choose caregivers whom you like and trust Choose one oncologist to be your most trusted adviser and ally to help you make the best decisions at every juncture of your cancer journey Although there is only one person going under the surgical knife or receiving chemotherapy cancer still affects an entire family and more Seek the help of professional counselors who will help you cope with cancer as well as provide guidance on how to communicate effectively with your loved ones about your situation Family and friends will want to help you cope with cancer but they will need guidance on how best to do so Let them help you with chores children and transportation to and from treatment The diagnosis and treatment of cancer no matter how successful the result frequently causes depression and anxiety and nearly always uncertainty Learning how best to cope with these is vitally important to getting through the treatment phase and especially during longterm survivorship You and your employer will want to know how much time you will need to deal with cancer Do not try to maintain a full work schedule during arduous treatments Consider short or longterm disability depending on the rigors and aftereffects of treatment Even if you are highly likely to survive your cancer the diagnosis is a good reason to get your financial situation in order for the sake of you and your loved ones The ultimate goal is for you to have your life so organized that you can deal with cancer treatment almost on autopilot This will also enable you to have time for yourself which is an essential component of the recovery process I dont believe you have a cervixso thus you cannot get cervical cancer The cervix is usually removed with the uterus Hiccups are NOT a symptom of prostate cancer Cervical cancer may have an underlying cause such as HPV human papilloma virus but I would have no idea if this man also has HPV Herpes is an entirely different type of infection that does not cause cervical cancer but can be transmitted to you during sex A condom would offer a reasonable but not 100 protection against herpes Nowho told you that Both testicles produce sperm that can create a boy or a girl so assuming his remaining testicle is producing a normal amount of viable sperm he is capable of fathering a child of any sex Noif it did millions of people would have it especially Asian countries Soy is just fine I dont know what KIND of cancer that his sister and brother have Absolutely not There has never been a scientific association made between ovarian cancer and the use of perfumed talcum powder baby powder These are two very different types of serious cancers One is not the precursor of the other Not at allwhite blood cells leukocytes can occur from inflammation andor infection in the colon It does not mean cancer I am not an attorney but if diagnostic mistakes were made you may have a case The most important thing for you to do right now of course is to focus on treating and curing your cancer Filing or even winning a malpractice suit does not change the fact that you have a very serious disease that requires proper treatment No cannabis does not cure any cancer but it is used by some cancer patients to help pain control and to improve appetite Get a second opinion from another urologist A prostate biopsy is not a pleasant procedure so it should only be done if absolutely necessary His PSA is fine but the PSA is not the definitive marker I dont know his age or risk factors but if his prostate examination is normalhis PSA is normalI am puzzled by the recommendation The urologist has a responsibility to justify this procedure so have a facetoface consultation and hear has rationale I cant offer you a definitive answer since I have no way of examining you over the Internet but this could be a small spermatocele  unrelated to your varicocele I would suggest that you see your medical provider so that you can be properly examined and diagnosed If you do have a lump on the testicle itself this will need to be confirmed Find a new PCP and talk directly with the medical director of your insurance company or the medical group I dont know your age but your family history certainly justifies a higher level of cancer detection The only definite 100 way of determining if a skin lesion is a skin cancer or not is with a biopsy Either the entire lesion  or a piece of the lesion is removed and analyzed by a pathology lab A skilled clinician like a dermatologist can give you a prettygood idea but a visual inspection can be wrong Because of your family history of melanoma it would be wise to get it checked out Noit will not cause cancer I had one myself Spermatoceles are considered innocent They do not turn into cancer but if it is changing in size as you mentioned just have your medical provider examine your scrotal area at your annual exam You cannot catch cancerit is not contagious There is really no way of knowing The stage of a cancer cannot be determine by feeling it I am so sorry to hear about your father Yeswhen he is cleared by his oncologist Brachyotherapy radioactive seeds are very localized to the prostate and does not put anyone else at risk No A prostate massage will not prevent prostate cancer No This statement is not true NOniacin does not cause cancer Pancreatic cancer cannot be diagnosed by a simple blood test with borderline results but any person with abdominal discomfort for as long as you have suffered needs a very thorough diagnostic workup and imaging studies A reason for your nausea and diarrhea as well as a solution needs to be found Rather than just worry about pancreatic cancer you should continue the active pursuit as to the cause of your symptoms Prostate cancer can be one of the slower progressive cancers Depending on the age and health status of this family member the doctor may feel that aggressive therapy surgery radiation etc may not be appropriate at this time and wants to have some watchful waiting Since I dont know the details of his case it is difficult guess at the reasons There is absolutely no reason not to have a consultation from an oncologist or have a second opinion from another urologist when it comes to these management decisions Doctors are like chefs They all cook a bit differently so having some additional expert opinions can be helpful One of my best friends was diagnosed with prostate cancer two weeks ago had a complete prostatectomy this week because of his profound cancer fear only to find out that a his cancer wasnt as bad as they thought and b a complete prostatectomy was probably not needed Had he had waited a bit longer had another opinion and did his own research he may not have jumped right to the operating room I dont think that anyone knows for sure at this point Pancreatic cancer has been around a long time before Lipitor and most people who have pancreatic cancer have never used it Keep abreast of any new information that may surface on the MEDICAL SITES but an association is not necessarily a cause You could easily make an association that people who eat at a certain fast food chain have a higher level of a disease than someone who doesnt or that a large percentage of people who have a type of cancer had driven a car prior to the diagnosis These are associations If any definitive studies are found with a causative relationship any suspect drug is immediately pulled from the market Hot showers will not cause cell damage or cancer Chlorinated water is safe It would be impossible to know if anyone had cancer based on one sentence I do not know your age or other risk factors and obviously I cannot exam those areas of concern The only way you can get the reassurance you are seeking is to physically see a medical provider or ENT for an examination Cancer of the tonsils typically does not meet your vague description but I cannot blindly answer your questions and concerns Anything they want to eator can eat based on their level of nausea Most pancreatic cancer patients are on painkillers that can cause nausea or severe constipation so finding a diet that is both pleasurable and one that can prevent constipation is the best As you know this is a very serious cancer so this person should be allowed to eat just about anything they want and can tolerate These are two very different types of cancerone does not lead to the other Your boyfriend may already have HPV so dont be afraid to tell him Honesty is the best and safest policy when involved in a sexual union If he has had previous partners like you have he could have already been infectedif not from you from someone else If you have HPV in your mouth or throat you could transmit it orally vaginally or even anallyit depends on where you have it I know you have heard this before but the use of condoms will certainly limit the spread of HPV to your sexual partneror any future partner You cannot diagnose oral cancer soley by a brief vague description so my advice to you is to visit your dentist or see your primary care provider for a careful examination of this dark changing spot The risk of oral cancer increases dramatically if you use tobacco chew or smoke so hopefully you do not partake in this cancercausing habit Yes a 55 year old man can have testicular cancer but before making a selfdiagnosis see your medical provider or a urologist for a proper examination I am very sorry but without a handson examination and a detailed medical history it would not be possible to blindly offer you a definite diagnosis determine if this mass was cancer and suggest a treatment In order for you to be properly diagnosed I would suggest that you see a surgeonsomeone who can examine this mass perhaps do a biopsy and address this tenyear old problem No prostate cancer is not contagious through sexual activity or otherwise If someone that you care about has prostate cancer they will need your support and caring There is no universal healthy diet that would be appropriate for two different people one who needs to lose weight and another who may have special nutritional needs due to cancer or cancer treatment You can BOTH see a nutritionist Have an expert work this out for you While there are universal good foods and healthy recommendations that will apply to every human you need INDIVIDUAL dietary plans Oxycodone of course is a potent narcotic pain medication His doctor must feel that he needs this level of pain control Ondansetron is used to control nausea and vomiting only TheODT just means Oral Disintegrating Tablet melts in your mouth Oxycodone can cause nausea but I have no idea if this is the reason his doctor prescribed it There is a book by this same title so you can buy it on Amazon and get the answer firsthand Without nipples how would teenage boys torture each other with twisters What would punk guys have left to pierce How would you know when it was cold Nipples in men have no medical purpose but since it hurts to remove them and you will look a little weird without them just leave em alone Maybe another few thousand years of evolution will make them disappear Yesand yes The HPV vaccine covered my all insurances incidentally does prevent most strains of cervical cancer Because of YOUR past sexual experiences statistically there is a good chance that you have already contracted HPV yourself and may have already exposed your current girlfriend In the outside chance that she has not be exposed to HPV the vaccine would offer here excellent protection By the way should you should be vaccinated too Every person is different so without a handson examination it is really difficult if not impossible to offer you a patientspecific answer The lump could be many thingsfrom a sebaceous cyst to a reactive lymph node Instead of worrying about cancer see your medical provider so you can have a definitive answer not a blind guess or list of possibilities The bone scan is appropriateto make sure any prostatic cancer has not metastazed to the bones This is part of the thorough diagnostic workup and your doctor has the obligation to explain his or her rationale for doing these procedures To my knowledge there is that has been scientifically established between genital herpes and prostate cancer A cancer can just about develop anywhere in the body but I have to say that this would be rare If you are concerned have your medical provider order some imagining studies so that your sinuses can be properly evaluated Yes of course Many cancers can lead to death or cause other fatal complications A node is a shortened form to mean LYMPH node There are lymph nodes in many places of your bodylike your neck under your arms groin and your mesenteric near the intestines Lymph nodes react enlarge or become inflamed in response to inflammation andor infection in their immediate neighborhood Colitis itself can cause reactive nodes and does not automatically mean cancer Of course inflammation can be caused by cancer too A polyp is an inflammatory growthand would by inside the intestine in your case Some polyps are cancersome are precancerousbut most are benign These are questions that your doctor should be addressing with you since heshe is familiar with your case and can interpret your CT scan firsthand No not necessarily Your wife may have gotten HSV herpes from a previous partner if you do not have it A person can have both of course but these are two very different viruses Yes you can get the vaccine It should not be a problem He has not been taking it long enough for a physical or psychological dependence It is always best to check with his doctor however who may want to decrease his dose rather than stop it Pain specialists often have there own method of management True keloids are just hypertrophic scars They are not cancerous and they typically do not itch or cause pain so it would be best to see your medical provider so this keloid can be properly examined I do not see how drinking something acidic lemon juice is citric ACID will make your body alkaline Doesnt make sense I have never heard that having an alkaline body alkalosis would prevent a cancer reoccurrence Sounds like a bunch of baloney to me I am not sure where you read this or the credentials of who is recommending it but I think this notion lacks scientific validity Our body works very hard to maintain a properly pH balance Drink lemon juice in water lemonade if you want or if you like it The vitamin C will be nice but dont expect it to make your body alkaline If you are a smoker or have other risk factors cancer of the throat is always a possibility but with a sore throat for only four days  one that is strep negative  the most likely culprit is a plain ol respiratory virus These viruses tend to last a week so hang in there a bit longer If your sore throat persists consider getting a blood test for mono andor see an ENT for an exam If you are a smoker STOP SMOKING This article should answer your question httpwwwwebmdcombreastcancernews20110301smokingmayincreasebreastcancerrisk I dont know anything about you or your medical history to tell you your chances that this blood is due to colon cancer but that is the reason this simple test is done There are MANY reasons why this test would be positive other than cancer but when you have a positive test your medical provider will need to do a very careful diagnostic workup to determine the source of the blood It could be from your stomach your colon a hemorrhoid an anal fissure tear or from eating a lot of red blood containing meat Dont be alarmed but it is very important to get to the bottom no pun intended of this positive test These two cancers are not connected but it is still unfortuante for you to have this family history I wish you the best in your recent cervical biopsies and hope everything turns out fine for you As far as your breast cancer history is concerned talk to your womens health expert to see if you can have special genetic test Noeye floaters are very common and are not linked to cancer Yesthere are MANY different birth control methods that do not use hormonal control See a gynecologist discuss your medical history and this expert will help you select a method that is right for you Yeshaving a higherlevel opinion from a cancer specialist like an oncologist is recommended Nothey are two different types of liver disease Here is a good resource for you httpwwwliverfoundationorgabouttheliverinfocirrhosis I dont know what your particular chances are since I do not have enough information about you or your mothers case but needless to say you may have a higher risk so a proper biopsy of that enlarged lymph node and careful examination some diagnostic tests and perhaps an early mammogram would be prudent in your case Medicare Are you over 65 or perhaps disabled You would need to check with the insurance company that is managing your Medicare services or contact them directly Many of the sperm bank facilities may be able to help you address this coverage question Cutting off a cancerous mole yourself would not be wise You would have both a fool for a patientand a doctor Unless you get wide margins only determined by a proper pathological examination and those margins are cancerfree this could cause some skin cancers to quickly spread Please leave the cancerous mole excisions to the experts Push the insurance company Do NOT take no as the first answer and ask to talk to the medical director or better yet have your physician request an exemption to the rule A friend of mine wanted a colonoscopy early because her grandmother had colon cancer They refused at first only offering a sigmoidoscopy a cheaper and less thorough exam They finally okayed the colonoscopy and a precancerous lesion was found in a place where the sigmoidoscopy would not have discovered Had she waited several more years like the insurance company wanted she would have definitely had colon cancer by that time Fight em The use of marijuana does not change the course of brain cancer The only way it tends to help is by improving appetitereducing nausea when a person is under treatment All other scientificallyunproven claims should be taken with a grain of salt Your GYN may likely suggest treatment for your abnormal pap smear so that it does not progress to a cervical cancer It is good that this was discovered now As far as who gave it to you that answer may not be possible You could have been exposed by any one of your past sexual partners You may not have been tested for HPV in the past when you were tested for STDs It really doesnt matter in the long run since you cannot change the past What really matters is that you will be properly treated NOW If it did it would NOT be on the market nor be as popular as it is as a prescription Extensive studies prior to FDA approval has proven that Viagra does not cause cancer Unfortunately it would not be possible for me or any medical professional to answer that question without the details of her case Even then trying to guess someones chances is just thata guess There are many people who greatly exceed their doctors prognosis Just support your mother that best that you can to help her relieve some of that stress See that she gets the best of careand the rest is up to God not someone with a medical degree Unless a medical provider could examine you firsthand and take a detailed medical history it would not be prudent to make a blind guess over the Internet as to what this lump might be A picture is not helpful unfortunately A medical provider would need to carefully examine not only this lump of concern but examine the entire area from the neck up It could be a lymph node cyst or yes it could be a sign of a serious mass  one that may need to be imaged CT or MRI or perhaps even biopsied You cannot make this determination from a photo or a vague description You are the trustee of your body It is your responsibility to take this seriously and be properly examined A Bartholin cyst will not turn into cancer but that does not mean you should avoid seeing a gynecologist for a firsthand evaluation of this 20 year old issue Get it checked out Yesthat is EXACTLY what happens and why both men and women need the HPV vaccine before they start having sex and why couples who are not monogamous should always use a condom HPV is the main cause of cervical cancer and men with HPV are causing it If your brother was specifically prescribed a diuretic by one of his physicians who are treating his lung cancer then yeshe should take it Each person on chemotherapy is uniqueoften taking different types and dosages of chemotherapeutic agents and not every person would need a diuretic Your brother appears that he does I wish your brother and family the very best on his treatment I have no way of diagnosing the type of mouth sores that you have but clotrimazole lozenges would only be helpful for yeast thrush They would not have any effect on canker sores aphthous ulcers or other lesions Most recurrent mouth lesions are aphthous ulcers I am so sorry to hear about your sisters Yes there most definitely may be a familial connection with cervical cancer in your family This is all the more reason for you to have regular pap smearspap smears taken and processed properly Pap smears are reliable but they are only as good as the skill of the person getting the cell specimen the skill of the lab processing the sample and the skill of the pathologist reading the slides If you think that pathologist may have missed it on your sisters last pap perhaps it would be good to obtain them the orginal slides or microphotographs should be kept on file a the pathology facility Her next of kin may have to request them officially but I do not see why another independent pathologist cannot reread them Mistakes have been made before I can assure you Reviewing these slides will not bring back your sister as you know but it may help you with closure and give you a bit more confidence with your own pap smear tests If a cancer was missed this would be a serious malpractice situation If a person is allergic to house dust they can develop a chronic illness chronic allergies from it House dust is not a cause of lung cancer unless that dust had carcinogens in it like asbestos Maybe your boyfriend should come to YOUR house from now on You have the right to do what you want but does a delay really make medical sense Are you considering this for financial or other personal reasons I dont know why you would want to delay I dont know you or your case to advise you in this matter so I strongly suggest that you take the expert advice of the urologist who is treating you or see a second urologist for an official second opinion I think you should SEE your doctor if you have a sore throat A direct examination and perhaps a diagnostic test for Strep is really the best way to determine the cause of your sore throat All women can make their own decision on when or even whether they have a pelvic examination and a pap smear  these are TWO very different procedures A pelvic exam is more than just a visual inspection of the cervix and external genitalia there is a bimanual componet to feel for masses benign tumors cancers ovarian abnormalities enlarged uterus etc The pap smear is primarily for cancer or precancerous lesions There are no good substitutes for either one They are not just for women at risk Periodic pelvics and pap smears are for ALL women They dont have to be annual anymore If you have a series of negative paps and do not have an genetic familial or medical risk factors they can be less often Discuss this with your gynecologist This would be highly unlikely however I do not know what TYPE of cyst you are talking about and where it is located Perhaps higher but I could not provide you with a number or percentage since I do not know the type of breast cancer that your mother has to know if it is a type that is geneticallylinked Your mother can ask her oncologist and then let you know if you are at a higher risk Pancreatic cancer pain can be severe Since pain medication is very patientspecific it would be best to have a pain specialist manage this persons pain The best medication for one person may not be the best medication for another No Hpylori is a bacteria that can cause a stomach or duodenal ulcer It is not cancer Nojust most of them I am sure there is more to your PET and CT scan than those few words Without knowing your medical history examination findings having the entire report and images in front of me it would not be prudent for me or any medical professional to make this critical call I know you are anxious but it is really up to your doctor  someone who has all of the details of your case  to interpret those findings Your posting is confusion The term lingual refers to the tongue so I am guessing that you mean inguinal groin Hernias do not cause cancer but they can be problematic during certain exercises or perhaps yoga positions so I would advise you to discuss this with your doctor  someone who knows the details of your medical history No You and your wife can still have a sex life without fear that this activity will cause a problem with the remaining kidney Liver cancer is a complication of hepatitis C Hepatitis C is a virus and can be transmitted but cancer is not really a viruscertain cancer types can be caused by a virus Another example would be the HPV virus causing cervical cancer It would be possible to get hepatitis from another person Untreated ovarian cancer is likely to progress metastasize and cause the demise of the patient Exposure to an infectious disease like HPV does not imply that you will even get it Even if you develop HPV there is no certainty that you will develop a cancer many many years later but your risk is definitely higher Noantiperspirants have not been linked to breast cancer Otherwise you would not see anyone using them If you have viable active sperm from your one remaining testicle you would have to get a sperm count then you could father a child A person with pancreatic cancer can really eat anything they want or at least anything that sounds good to them Loss of appetite is not uncommon with this terrible disease often made worse by pain medications or treatments some of which can cause severe constipation Nausea can be controlled by medication so if this is influencing food choices then it should be medically managed It is important to eat sufficient amounts to maintain strength but sometimes the idea of food is just repulsive Be very supportive Ask the person about their favorite foods and give it to them Anythingice cream smoothies lobster tailyou name it If the heart has a desire try and fullfill the wish Lung cancer can metastasize spread to other organs Many times we will find a tumor or mass on one organ but will need to look in other organs to find the primary first tumorthe one that started it all The doctor may be investigating the liver as a metastatic site from lung cancer but you would need to address this question directly to the doctor You have no risk nowthe only risk for developing a testicular cancer would be in the testicle that was removed when you were 16 Your other testicle is quite important now so please do a routine testicular selfexam when you take a shower Any lumps should be brought to the attention of your medical provider Your remaining testicle is not at any increased risk because of your past historyno more than the rest of men of your age Yesyou have to taste his tobacco Isnt it like kissing an ashtray Get him to stop this nasty habit To make him a tobacco nonuser it is okay to withhold kissing until he does I dont think there are any cases of oral cancer from kissing a tobacco user but that does not imply that it couldnt happen Show your boyfriend some Internet pictures of oral cancer No As much as I would like to address your concerns I really do not know anything about youyour age medical history or even if you are a female men have breasts too More importantly it would take a thorough examination to determine if this lump is worrisome or not Although I am sympathetic to your lack of insurance an examination is really the only way to make this important call I can tell you that lumps that come and go are more likely to be cysts especially if the lumps are influenced by your menstrual cycle again assuming you are female Breast cancers do not come and gosadly they tend to stay and get bigger over time Dates are good Honey is good As good as they are as foods they will not cure or really medically help any form of cancer Flu vaccine does not cause cancer but ANY vaccine that you get should be specifically approved by the team of physicians that are caring for you  the ones that know you and your medical history The final okay comes from them I have no idea how your boyfriend got it I know nothing about him or his past The H of the HPV means human so we do know that he got from direct contact with another humankissing oral sex He may not even know at this point Not all species of HPV is sexuallytransmitted nor the type that causes cancer so perhaps you both should speak to his medical provider for some direct answersif there are answers to be obtained Try and get your old records to confirm that diagnosisincluding the pathology report To get a breast CANCER at age 13 is extremely rare so I would question the validity of that diagnosis You do realize that I have no way of examining you over the Internet  the only way to offer you a patientspecific answer Your description is just too vague for me to even guess if you have inflammatory skin tags Polyps Warts condylomata or hemorrhoids If you have had these things for four years perhaps it is time for you to be properly diagnosed Since your regular medical provider did not offer you an answer then seen a gastroenterologist or proctologist This is really their department You may be worried about nothing Please relax and be like your mother The vast majority of skin lesions are NOT cancer and those that are may be very easy to treat from removing the lesion in the office to topical creams If every skin cancer was the dreaded malignant melanoma we would all be in trouble Since I cant see or examine your mother I cannot tell you what it is or how it will be treated You must first know what the it is There is absolutely no way to predict an outcome of the biopsy or even discuss treatment To make a wild jump to worrying that a scalp lesion be fatal is going overboard You will not likely have any longterm health effects from doing this once but dont make it a habit All forms of smoking is bad for the lungs but our body does have a remarkable way of forgiving these isolated transgressions Take care of your lungs my friend If you are attending a college that has student health it is easy Just make an appointment for a physical If you are paying for this comprehensive exam it could be pricey The cost of medical care widely varies so if you still covered under your parents health insurance it is likely they will pay for preventative services Again just make an appointment for a physical exam with a good primary care clinician If you do not use tobacco tongue cancer would certainly be lesslikely If you had this same lesion unchanged for ten years then this would not be consisent with a malignant oral lesion The reason why your doctors are biopsing this lesion is to find out what it is Soon you will have that definitive answer and also will no longer have this lesion to worry about A hysterectomy is the surgical removal of the UTERUS The cervix is just the opening to the uterus so I do not know the extent of this persons surgery or cancer A uterus is required in order to bear children  Can she take a decongestant such as Sudefed or Sudefed PE That would help with the congestion greatly I am also a type 2 diabetic on Coumadin and take Sudefed daily Also if the nosebleeds are an issue you may want to try some Aquaphor on a qtip swabbing the inside of her nostrils with it Hope this helps Cancer cells are exquisitely sensitive and in fact stimulated to grow by testosterone So before a man is put on testosterone therapy its essential that we know he does not have cancer both by an exam and a blood test And if a man is put on testosterone he needs to be monitored to make sure that a cancer doesnt develop by monitoring the exam and the PSA blood test there are a lot of men out there who are saying ooh my testosterone is a little low I need a little oomph And theres a downside to that Absolutely Well the problem is that its easy to treat And men if theyre depressed if theyre feeling a little fatigued if their sex drive is down any reason they go to the doctor and its easy to say aha your testosterone is low give them testosterone replacements where they draw a single level and say this is the problem but thats not the way to do it But the testosterone level fluctuates dramatically throughout the day and so if you dont draw it at the right time you might get an artificially high or low level so it should be drawn ideally at late to midmorning And then you have to understand what it is youre treating Are you treating a symptom or are you treating a blood test result So we want to treat the man monitor the levels Its important that the levels be appropriate and its important that were sure were treating the right thing Just because his testosterone might be low there might be other more serious or dangerous causes of whats ailing him Hormone imbalances as far as like diabetes thyroid disorders liver disorders It could be side effects from medication it may be side effects from social activities such as marijuana tobacco or alcohol All of these things can impact on a man as well as if hes stressed or fatigued that doesnt necessarily mean theres something hormonally wrong Maybe hes not getting enough sleep 010801 Maybe hes stressed because of work and he just needs to learn stress reduction techniques than try to look for something a shot or a pill that will make things better Today there are a lot of problems treated with testosterone for problems that really arent low testosterone And we need to be careful because too much testosterone for the wrong reasons can stimulate prostate cancer Some men have little bumps on their scrotum and theyre concerned what is it could it be cancer First of all any time you want to know could something be cancer you need to see a doctor You cant guess you cant assume an online expert cant tell you what it is They can tell you in their experience what they think it might be But until a doctor looks at you and examines you and looks at that lump or bump theres no way to tell Especially with testicular or scrotal irregularities if somebody says to me Ive got a lump down there what is it I tell them youve have to see a doctor I can tell you what it probably is or what it isnt but you have to see a doctor Because sometimes testicular cancers can manifest exactly the way they should Sometimes its not that way Its a funny little ache or its a little bit of fullness or its a little bump So some men have scrotal bumps theyre usually cysts What we tell men is if its been there your whole life and it hasnt changed chances are its not bad If its changing like a cyst might where it fills up and then drains and empties those need to be seen because they can be removed Testicular lumps are different they need to be examined often with a testicular ultrasound almost always by a urologist whos skilled and experienced in understanding the subtle little lumps and bumps within the scrotum of the testicles and surrounding organs Aggressive treatments are merely designed to remove the cancer get it out of your body If its aggressive and we pursue a conservative approach we may fail and the problem with this is theres no second place in this race You either survive or you dont So aggressive treatment is surgical removal For many years it was a fairly horrendous big operation a lot of blood loss time in the intensive care and you were miserable for a long time weeks if not months But with advances in surgical techniques new laparoscopic techniques the operation is a couple of hours youre in and out some men are home the next day and feeling great they cant believe they had anything done In fact the biggest problem is that we want men to take it easy and they feel so good they want to resume normal strenuous activity So aggressive surgical management removing the cancer is still the gold standard Its still the primary way to get the cancer out of your body so you can live a normal life If youre not a candidate for aggressive surgery or you dont want aggressive surgery which is always your option then there are outstanding conservative approaches In fact some of the new techniques in radiation have revolutionized so some people think it may actually be as good as surgery That includes some of the new radiation techniques radioactive seed therapy hormone therapy are also becoming far more positive with some of the chemotherapy options and now with some of the new approaches with vaccine and gene therapy So things are very exciting in a conservative way so that you can benefit from the treatment but not suffer from the side effects of the treatment OK There are a number of different factors that play into whether this prostate cancer is going to be significant Obviously we want to know the volume of the cancer Is there a lot there Obviously the more there is the worse it is And we want to know the grain how aggressive it is Is this like a little puppy or is it like a Doberman with rabies The more aggressive the cancer the worse the prognosis The more likely youll need aggressive therapy And the larger volume also has a role And we also do studies to evaluate has it spread is it just in one little area or has it spread So thats the two factors that we look at in determining how aggressive this cancer will or will not be for you Then we have to look at the factors that relate to you Whats your health whats your age how old were your parents when they died if not If your father died at age 50 and youre 47 then  SL OK Well go back to that So um if your father is 50 years old when he died and youre 47 then we may not be as aggressive with higherrisk treatments If on the other hand youre 57 and your father is 94 and still active vibrant healthy then we need to consider that you probably have 40 years ahead of you and well be more aggressive We also need to look at your health If you have any heart disease blood vessel disease diabetes if youre out climbing mountains and hiking the Grand Canyon and youre 63 then were going to want to be more aggressive as well So all of those factors go into determining the nature of what the threat is because we never want the treatment worse than the disease We know that for the majority of men prostate cancer will not kill them so we want to customize treatment If youre young and healthy we may be more aggressive If youre old and have health problems we probably will not The problem with prostate cancer is that there really are not any obvious symptoms Men can present getting up at night to urinate going frequently during the daytime those really are all problems mostly of an enlarged prostate There are no obvious signs that you can say this is from prostate cancer This is why its so important for men to go see their doctor for an exam and a PSA blood test annually Prostate cancer can have a significant hereditary component Men whose fathers brothers uncles grandfathers have had prostate cancer theyre at a significantly higher risk for prostate cancer The majority of men who were diagnosed though dont have it in the family So just because your father uncle brother doesnt have it doesnt mean youre free and clear But if he does have it then your risks are higher and you just need to be more diligent when you see your doctor Its essential that when you go to the doctor youre at a higher risk that you want a prostate exam and you want the PSA blood test Many doctors even aware of that still are reluctant to do a prostate exam because not only is it uncomfortable for a few seconds to have some strange doctor do the exam but the doctors dont enjoy it either So a lot of doctors unfortunately will spend hours listening to every body part and probing every orifice except they wont do a prostate exam So you almost have to insist on it Well thatll be something most men wont do SM Its unfortunate that they dont but they need to It may be life or death And not only does a rectal exam identify prostate nodules or irregularities but rectal cancers Recently there was a celebrity on the news about anal cancer Rectal and anal cancers are very deadly when not picked up early and its so easy to detect that its almost disastrous when the doctor doesnt do the exam So when you go to the doctor you need to have an understanding of what it is you expect Otherwise why are you even there Reviewed by Brunilda NazarioMD There are several things that you can do to reduce your risk for developing prostate cancer One of them is maintain a normal healthy lifestyle Excess obesity has been associated with increased risk for prostate cancer problems with inflammation or recurrent irritation also increase your risk for prostate cancer as well as excess testosterone placement Today there

cancer is not known But there are several risk factors for the disease Other diseases Colorectal cancer is strongly associated with certain other diseases Those people considered at high risk include anyone with a personal or family history of colon polyps inflammatory disease of the colon such as ulcerative colitis or Crohns disease and cancers of the pancreas breast ovaries or uterus Heredity As with any cancer susceptibility to colorectal cancer is at least partly determined by genetic makeup A few people inherit medical conditions such as familial adenomatous polyposis FAP MYHassociated polyposis MAP Gardners syndrome Turcots syndrome PeutzJaghers syndrome juvenile polyposis and Cowdens disease In all of these disorders colon polyps develop at an early age and unless treated these people are almost certain to develop colorectal cancer Hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer The disease extends from generation to generation and causes a person to develop colon cancer at a young age with up to 100 colon polyps which is why its called nonpolyposis This disease is associated with other cancers including endometrial small bowel upper urinary tract bladder ovary stomach bile duct skin and some pancreatic cancers This is known as the Lynch Syndrome Diet Diet also contributes to the risk of colorectal cancer although the causeandeffect relationship is still unclear People whose diets are high in fruits and vegetables seem to have a reduced risk Many studies implicate animal fat and protein as promoters of colorectal cancer although researchers are cautious about drawing any definite conclusions Some studies show that regularly eating red meat which is rich in saturated fat and protein increases risk while others find no connection Some scientists think that fat is the main culprit while others suspect protein Others contend that its not the fat and protein themselves but the way they are cooked They note that fats and protein cooked at high temperatures  especially when broiled and barbecued  can produce a host of potentially carcinogenic substances linked to colorectal cancer Chemical exposure Heavy exposure to certain chemicals including chlorine  which in small amounts is commonly used to purify drinking water  may increase the risk of colorectal cancer Exposure to asbestos is thought to be potentially harmful because it has been implicated in causing formation of polyps in the colon History of certain types of surgery Surgeries like ureterosigmoidostomy which is performed in the treatment of bladder cancer and a cholecsytecomy the removal of the gallbladder The ladder has been implicated as a risk for colon cancer development in some studies but not in others History of colon cancer A prior case of colon cancer increases the risk of a second colon cancer especially if the first cancer was diagnosed before the age of 60 Lifestyle Smoking and alcohol intake of more than 4 drinks per week increases the risk of developing colon cancer Family history Those with a firstdegree relative with colorectal cancer have an increased risk of the disease The risk increases if more than one firstdegree relative has colon cancer Radiation Prior radiation increases the risk of cancer to the radiated tissue only Various conditions both benign and cancerous malignant can affect the uterus the hollow pearshaped organ where a baby grows Fibroid tumors on the uterine wall are benign not cancerous and women who have them are not at increased risk for uterine cancer Abnormal growth of cells in the uterus lining  called the endometrium  is called endometrial hyperplasia It is the most serious benign uterine condition and in some women it evolves into uterine cancer Most uterine cancers arise in the endometrium and are called endometrial cancer or endometrial carcinoma The more aggressive uterine sarcoma arises in the wall of the uterus and accounts for less than 5 of all cases If left untreated endometrial cancer can penetrate the wall of the uterus and invade the bladder or rectum or it can spread to the vagina fallopian tubes ovaries and more distant organs Fortunately endometrial cancer grows slowly and usually is detected before spreading very far The liver continuously filters blood that circulates through the body converting nutrients and drugs absorbed from the digestive tract into readytouse chemicals The liver performs many other important functions such as removing toxins and other chemical waste products from the blood and readying them for excretion Because all the blood in the body must pass through it the liver is unusually accessible to cancer cells traveling in the bloodstream The liver can be affected by primary liver cancer which arises in the liver or by cancer which forms in other sites and then spreads to the liver Most liver cancer is secondary or metastatic meaning it started elsewhere in the body Primary liver cancer which starts in the liver accounts for about 2 of cancers in the US but up to half of all cancers in some undeveloped countries This is mainly because of the prevalence of hepatitis caused by contagious viruses that predisposes a person to liver cancer Worldwide primary liver cancer strikes twice as many men as women making it the most common type of cancer in males with it mostly affecting people over 50 Because the liver is made up of several different types of cells several types of tumors can form in the liver Some of these are benign noncancerous and some are cancerous and can spread to other parts of the body metastasize These tumors have different causes and are treated differently The outlook for your health or recovery depends on what type of tumor you have The more common benign tumors of the liver include Hemangioma Hepatic adenoma Focal nodular hyperplasia Cysts Lipoma Fibroma Leiomyoma None of these tumors are treated like liver cancer They may need to be removed surgically if they cause pain or bleeding Liver cancers include Hepatocellular carcinoma HCC Cholangiocarcinoma These are really cancers of the bile duct Having UC or Crohns disease increases the risk of developing colorectal cancer but most people more than 90 with inflammatory bowel disease dont develop cancer The American Cancer Society recommends that people with UC and Crohns have a screening colonoscopy eight years after diagnosis if the entire large intestine is involved and 12 to 15 years after diagnosis if only the left part of it is affected Followup colonoscopy screening should occur every one to two years after that In many cases people may have no early symptoms of kidney cancer As the tumor grows larger symptoms may appear You may have one or more of these kidney cancer symptoms Blood in your urine A lump in your side or abdomen A loss of appetite A pain in your side that doesnt go away Weight loss that occurs for no known reason Fever that lasts for weeks and isnt caused by a cold or other infection Extreme fatigue Anemia Swelling in your ankles or legs Kidney cancer that spreads to other parts of your body may cause other symptoms such as Shortness of breath Coughing up blood Bone pain Maybe youve had kidney cancer symptoms such as side pain weight loss or extreme fatigue Or maybe your doctor has found a lump in your side during a routine exam or a sign of kidney cancer during a test for another disease Regardless to confirm a diagnosis of kidney cancer you will need a thorough physical exam health history and tests Your doctor will feel your abdomen and side for lumps and check for fever and high blood pressure among other things You will also answer questions about your health habits any past illnesses and types of treatment To make a diagnosis of kidney cancer your doctor will also order one or more tests like these Urine tests check for blood in your urine or other signs of problems Blood tests show how well your kidneys are working Intravenous pyelogram IVP involves Xraying your kidneys after the doctor injects a dye that travels to your urinary tract highlighting any tumors Ultrasound uses sound waves to create a picture of your kidneys It can help tell if a tumor is solid or fluidfilled A CT scan uses Xrays and a computer to create a series of detailed pictures of your kidneys This may also require an injection of dye CT scans have virtually replaced pyelogram and ultrasound as a tool for diagnosing kidney cancer Magnetic resonance imaging MRI uses strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of soft tissues in your body You may need an injection of a contrast agent to create better pictures Renal arteriogram This test is used to evaluate the blood supply to the tumor It is not given often but may help diagnose small tumors and has other uses as well Unlike with many other cancers your doctor may be pretty certain about a diagnosis of kidney cancer without a biopsy In rare cases it may be done to confirm the diagnosis A doctor may use a needle biopsy to remove a sample of tissue which is then examined under a microscope for cancer cells The biopsy may also tell the grade of the cancer  how aggressive the cancer is likely to be Often the surgeon will simply remove the entire tumor and then have a sample of tissue examined Once your doctor makes a diagnosis of kidney cancer you may need other tests to tell if the cancer has spread within your kidney to the other kidney or to other parts of your body When cancer spreads from the place where it first started it has metastasized You might need a CT scan or MRI A chest Xray can show whether the cancer has spread to your lungs A bone scan can see if it is in your bones PET scans are helpful in telling if cancer has spread to lymph nodes near the kidney These tests will help your doctor know the stage of kidney cancer Symptoms of esophageal cancer include Difficulty or pain when swallowing Weight loss Pain in the chest behind the breastbone Coughing Hoarseness Indigestion and heartburn Because pancreatic cancer grows around important areas of the digestive system gastrointestinal symptoms often predominate Abdominal pain More than 80 of people with pancreatic cancer eventually experience some abdominal pain as the tumor grows Pancreatic cancer can cause a dull ache in the upper belly and back pain The pain may come and go Bloating Some people with pancreatic cancer have a sense of early fullness with meals satiety or an uncomfortable swelling in the abdomen Nausea Diarrhea Fat in the stool steatorrhea As pancreatic cancer reduces the pancreas ability to secrete fatdigesting enzymes more fat ends up in the stool These fatty stools can be strangesmelling and float more than normal Palecolored stools If the duct draining bile into the intestine is blocked by pancreatic cancer the stools may lose their brown color and become pale or claycolored Urine may become darker As it grows and spreads pancreatic cancer affects the whole body Constitutional symptoms can include Weight loss Malaise Loss of appetite Elevated blood sugars Some people with pancreatic cancer develop diabetes as the cancer impairs the pancreas ability to produce insulin However the vast majority of people with a new diagnosis of diabetes do not have pancreatic cancer In a very small number of people with pancreatic cancer early symptoms might be present that could lead to earlier diagnosis Unfortunately researchers have been unable to identify any predictable pattern One study that surveyed 305 people with pancreatic cancer illustrated the challenge About 4 reported having a sudden disgust for preferred tastes like coffee smoking or wine that preceded other symptoms by more than six months 5 of people had loss of appetite a feeling of early fullness with meals or profound weakness more than six months before more obvious symptoms developed 1 of people had attacks of acute pancreatitis more than six months before their diagnosis with pancreatic cancer The rarity of these situations points out the difficulty of using early symptoms to catch pancreatic cancer at a curable stage That said symptoms like weight loss persistent loss of appetite or lightcolored stools should always prompt concern Consistent or worsening discomfort nausea vomiting or diarrhea are also worrisome If you feel somethings not right see your doctor This is a condition caused by a lack of red blood cells which transport oxygen to the bodys tissues Chemotherapy can damage red blood cells depriving the body of oxygen and leading to symptoms such as fatigue weakness dizziness and shortness of breath A neoplasm is an abnormal mass or colony of cells yes It is probably not cancer It might be a blockage of the salivary duct of the parotid salivary gland in your cheek Please dont delay Go see your dentist as soon as you can Throat cancers may show symptoms of a lump and or sore throat that doesnt go away a hard time swallowing and change in voice Click here

You might have an yeast infection  which can be easily treated fast if seen by a doctor  i had this same problem so your not alone  is not a form of cancer However if you have had extensive or total colitis for many years for more information visit this topic  httpulcerativecolitistreatmentblogspotcom201303canulcerativecolitisleadtobowelhtml Have you ever heard of kidneys being encased in a layer of fat not an obese person at all Both kidneys are that way I have recently learned through my own experience If you have bumpsflat raised clusters hard soft with fluid or not Go to a doctor Please take your child to the ER and get the Dr there to refer you to an oncologist This could be an indicator of cancer or it might be nothing more than a swollen lymph gland but you dont want to take chances with your child I know Good luck I know from personal experience the PSA is a very questionable test designed to promote more tests and more expenses by the male populace My PSA is 1049 I have acute bacterial prostitus This is treatable with powerful antibiotics If you still have fear thats what they want Then by all means have the Dr order a CAT scan and then you will know the truth J Ben Everything Ive read about this is more folkloreish  and not backed up by medical science I cant find anything that would back this up so for now Im going with no but Im obviously not a doc I know this must be really scary The tact I usually take in these situations is that I try not to let my imagination run wild and not think the worst I am so glad that he is going to the doctor I did see this article on Crohns Disease Thought it might be helpful if he had more of these sorts of symptoms httpwwwwebmdcomibdcrohnsdiseasecrohnsdiseasetccrohnsdiseasesymptoms I wish you all the best I know more about the connection between HPV and cervical cancer in women but there seems to potentially be a link between HPV and genital cancers in men Also I know that men and women can transfer HPV to each other through sexual contact Heres more information on HPV in men Hope this helps httpwwwwebmdcomsexualconditionshpvgenitalwartshpvvirusmen Oh sweetie please dont think the worst It could be an assortment of things including cysts or noncancerous tumors  even an infected ingrown hair But the only way to know for sure is go to a doctor If it is that small no matter what it is it may not be a problem as it would be simple to remove Just dont let it grow before doing anything about it need help pls Yes supplement with rose hips oilpills ginger tea dong quai rootblack cohosh herb red raspberry leaf maitake mushroomsdandelion roots goldenseal maybe make an appointment with a free clinic just for an exam also Im not sure if the bumps are a sign of cervical cancer but I would call your doctor and ask them It would probably put your mind at ease too Good luck It sounds like you could have a hemroid You can check by feeling around the out side of your rectum If you feel a vain like thing sticking out then that is what is it they will bleed especially if your straining when you have a bowel moment That is the only thing I can personally think of that would cause blood outside of your poop If it continues I would call your primary care doctor and tell them your symptomsGood luck For the last 6 months I have had pain with uterus vagina uterus Many years ago I had a DC freezing of leisons told I had precancerous cells by pap smears and have been told I had endometrous several times but no specific test done I am now in severe pain much of the time I had an ultrasound today and all they said was she couldnt find the ovaries What does this mean and is it a sign of ovarian cancer The pain is horrible especially when pressing when the ovaries They did a vaginal scan too Help my dr had me on high protein eat eggs peanut butter greek yogart  instant breakfast read labels try to get 30 grams protein daily Men can also get breast cancer Yes I would go to the ER if the pain is worse Do you have any other symptoms When did the pain start dull and acky pain of liver with vomiting is endomtrail cancer treatable in stage 4 Tramadol That is a question you need to ask your Gastrointerologist but I am sure that during a colonoscopy anything that is snipped is biopsied for sure yes you could not saying you would but there is definitely that possibility temedol is for cancer patients i have had swelling on brain before and was never perscribed temedol Idont symtoms of kidney cancer what happens to a person with pancreatic and liver cancer stage 4 after the 5 th chemo treatment and what happens to the body from there on  and how much time does a person have to live An answer I found elsewhere Lemon lime apple cider vinegar and tomato are highly acidic Strong acids bring the pH of a solution waaay down even in small amounts Also your blood has a buffer system to neutralize acids keeping your blood pH relatively stable regardless of what you eat It seems to me that this alkaline cooking fad has no scientific basis or at least led by misguided science I really dislike throwing around scientific words when you dont know what you are talking about MRI Cancerous dye will point out the live cancer separating it from a diag of Benign tumourscolour unknown Melanoma Dr Moser is incorrect Lemon and lime juices are absolutely alkalizing to the body This is not to say they are alkaline in nature because the are obviously acidic But the way the body metabolizes the juice produces an alkalizing effect Here is a video that might help explain it better youtubecomwatchvWndFDIa6a0sfeatureplayerembedded There are many licensed dietitians and nutritionist who have written of this fact Do yourself a favor and research it at length Most doctors are not aware of the chemistry involved NOTE the average MD has fewer than 8 hours of preventative medicine education  many have none whatsoever I dont think it has to hurt to be cancerous Most signs of cancer are not painful and sometimes go undetected until its far along or discovered by accident The American Caner Association is either being extremely negligent evasive or just plain ignorant when it comes to cancer According to German doctor Otto Wartberg the crux of his Nobel thesis was that malignant tumors frequently exhibit an increase in anaerobic glycolysis  a process whereby glucose is used as a fuel by cancer cells with lactic acid as an anaerobic byproduct  compared to normal tissues1 The large amount of lactic acid produced by this fermentation of glucose from cancer cells is then transported to the liver This conversion of glucose to lactate generates a lower more acidic pH in cancerous tissues as well as overall physical fatigue from lactic acid buildup23 Thus larger tumors tend to exhibit a more acidic pH4 This inefficient pathway for energy metabolism yields only 2 moles of adenosine triphosphate ATP energy per mole of glucose compared to 38 moles of ATP in the complete aerobic oxidation of glucose By extracting only about 5 percent 2 vs 38 moles of ATP of the available energy in the food supply and the bodys calorie stores the cancer is wasting energy and the patient becomes tired and undernourished This vicious cycle increases body wasting5 It is one reason why 40 percent of cancer patients die from malnutrition or cachexia6 Hence cancer therapies should encompass regulating bloodglucose levels via diet supplements nonoral solutions for cachectic patients who lose their appetite medication exercise gradual weight loss and stress reduction Professional guidance and patient selfdiscipline are crucial at this point in the cancer process The quest is not to eliminate sugars or carbohydrates from the diet but rather to control blood glucose within a narrow range to help starve the cancer and bolster immune function To read more go to the April 2000 Issue of Nutrition Science News or wwwmercolacomarticlesugarsugarcancer do i need to get vaginal ultrasound on account of age 54 no symtoms doctore recommened Cancer is painless conditionSo only we miss early stageAny lump painless at armpit can be associated with early breast cancerImmediately you must have biopsy done IF it hurts or painful it must be local infectionConsult your family doctorhave treatment with proper antibiotics getting cat scan today of abdominal area todaydoes this mean possible cancer My PSA was 68 and had 2 biopsies no bumps no cancer but because my doctor did not like the signs he did a  saturation biopsy which then showed I had a GLEASON SCALE OF T8 which at that point it starts SPREADING TO THE BONEY STRUCTURES AND LYMPH GLANDS  The simple biopsy only hits a small part of the Prostate Had he not been persistent and dependent upon my PSA I would be planning my funeral TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY Those who belittle the PSA should have their tongues cut out Is high white blood cells a sign of cancer Symptoms of PC overlap a lot with symptoms of other prostate problems like enlargement Thats what makes PC so hard to detect even with a biopsy To develop a healthy prostate a healthy lifestyle is key But you also could add what some think is a scam Super Beta Prostate It provides a dozen key nutrients for the prostate along with loads of betasitosterol to keep the gland functioning well even in the later years Besides the manual testing by your doctor there is the PSA test that might tell you a little about whats going on in your prostate If you have any conditions it might be wise to look into natural supplements like Super Beta Prostate Supplement It contains betasitosterol that really supports prostate health Symptoms of PC overlap a lot with symptoms of other prostate problems like enlargement Thats what makes PC so hard to detect even with a biopsy To develop a healthy prostate a healthy lifestyle is key But you also could add what some think is a scam Super Beta Prostate It provides a dozen key nutrients for the prostate along with loads of betasitosterol to keep the gland functioning well even in the later years Had this huge thing inside the inner lip for the last month I thought it was a blood blister but my ENT said it was a mucous plug Its very painful httpwwwnewdentalimagescom I had a ct with dye on my bladder an kidneys as i was having severe pain bloating excess bloodextreme pain said they were non cancerous cystsHow do they know this wasnt canerous I also get these from time to time Typically one lump under one armpit That said I assumed it was an ingrown hair or some type of irritation from deodorant I ignored these lumps as they were few and far between I also researched the lumps and found that when painful they typically are not serious I noticed online that people suggested draining the lump themselves poking with a needle popping like a zit etc I do not think this is smart whatsoever You will only cause additional irritation One thing I have not seen as a suggestion to ease the pain and draw the lump out of the skin is epsom salt I use a warm compress of water and epsom salt when I get these lumps I do this a few times a day and leave the warm rag under my arm for roughly ten minutes each time This method works The fluid in the lump will draw out and the lump will rupture without poking If there is a deep lump then you have to let nature take its course and let it rise to the surface somewhat on its own but the epsom salt speeds this process along I thought of this method because growing up my mom used epsom salt to draw out slivers or a stinger I am shocked that no one has mentioned this online but thought Id share in hopes it will help someone With one deep lump I had I used the epsom salt compress on and off for about 3 days and on the 3rd day applied GENTLE pressure with the soft parts of my fingers and viola the lump popped and the pain subsided Btw it was grossLOL As for a new experience with lumps that I am currently having I have multiple painful lumps under BOTH sides of my armpits Obviously this is not an ingrown hair I have also been extremely tired have continuous night sweats and shortness of breath I went to my doctor only to find out that I have a severe infection coursing through my body which caused the lumps lymphnode infection They started me on strong antibiotics and I am awaiting results to find out exactly what type of infection I have Hope its not too serious So the long and the short of ita lump with no other symptoms may just be caused by some type of irritation A lump with other symptoms should be inspected by your doctor right away My doctor said that when these types of infections pop up lymphnodes they can get out of hand very quickly Just thought Id share Epsom salt can be found at any drug store or grocery store and is cheap Delayed OR slow start of the urinary system dribbling or leakage mostly after urination slow urination stream unable to empty all track straining system blood in semen or blood in urine note  bone pain or tender pelvic or lower back only if cancer has stream abnormal cell growth There is always a possibility However my mother had ovarian cysts quite often before and after hysterectomy Hers were always benign It wouldnt hurt to check with your gynecologist to be safe Or even your local health office if you dont still have a gynecologist It could mean cervical cancer but pap smears are known to be wrong but please go and follow up with itI had cervical cancer when I was 25 yrs old and chose to have a full hysterectomy since I had a child but there are many different procedures they can do that are so simple to get rid of it There is a chance you will have to have a colposcopy which is NOT painful at all and a very simple biopsy If it shows you have cancer there then they could possibly do surgical procedure called a conealysation slang for real name which is where they take a cone shaped piece out of the cervical area which removes the cancer and still gives you a chance to have childrenAll I know is if you take care of it very early in life things will be okgood luck and God bless I assume it distinguishes an area that is different from what it is supposed to be Actually I am just guessing and dont know How do you prevent teticular cancer YES GO NOW  bruised knee takes longer to heal than other bruised area if the pain isnt severe then rest otherwise talk to your doctor to see if you injured the jointbone ABSOLUTELY and make sure they do a biopsyonly way I was finally diagnosed with collagenous colitisbest decision ever enlarged prostate and a high PSA COUNT YES NO NO I had my spleen taken out and it showed that I had nonhodkins lymphoma They waited 6 months thinking it didnt spread but it did My bone marrow specialist at Rosewell said that they should have done a Pet scan sooner than 6 months no many people dont have childern sounds like hydrocele go to the dr and ask them about it Primary care physician What is perinephric  If it is calcified then it can be caused by a lot of things Do you have night sweats low grade fever and cough Any symptoms If you have these it could be due to a past infection with TB You can have a nodule in the lung without it becoming active TB TB can be dormant until you become immunocompromised then it can come out as disease Also dense calcified nodules can be due to inhalation of asbestos coal  and other chemicals and the body walls it off Other things it can be are sarcodosis and haemosiderosis Are they going to do a biopsy At this point I cant say what the percentage it is of any of these things It depends on what you or you and your famliy have been exposed to hope this helps marieh9 I went in to the doctors again today and I took your advice They said it was on the very verge of being Cancer If they had waited any longer it would of been Cancer They explained that the polyp normally grows into a ball like shape and mine was like a hand spread out So they are going to have me go in again for another Colonoscopy and make sure they got it all All the Byopsys were negative and they couldnt explain why tests showed up nothing however they found it when they went in and they just going to keep doing that from now on The Gardasil vaccine is meant to be preventative care It wont do any good once youve already acquired the virus It would be like getting a flu shot to try and get rid of the flu It just doesnt work that way Sorry I know that my mom accidently poured boiling water on her hand once after she had a stroke She did the following split the leaf gently rub the gel all over the burn Re applied 45 times daily no bandaging and kept it clean as possible Two weeks later it was almost all healed And her doctor praised the healing powers of the aloevera cactus Sounds like a UTI go see the Doc you need a gyno to tell you for sureUTIs can be dangerous please check it out soon no If you still have your fallopian tubes its possible because my mom had a hysterectomy but they left hr fallopian tubes and she still can tell when she should be menstruating if she had not had the hysterectomy masturbation and ejaculation are normal things that males do i truly dont think that could the cause of cancer even excessively done i done believe it would do anything out of normal  if you think you or someone you know may have prostate cancer go and speak with a doctor right away the sooner you get it addressed the better chances you have pf fighting it  hope this helps sounds to me like the mucus you have when your ovulating which is normal it should only last a few days  if your trying to get prego now would be the time  Im so sorry for your loss I can only imagine what you are going through First off the symptoms you are going through are natural signs of grief and are normal for most people Its a hard time right now and you are certainly going to have feelings about it Second there is no time limit on these feelings It may take awhile to start feeling like your normal self and somedays may be harder than others As it has only been a week since your brothers passing give yourself some time Make sure you eat well and rest Talk to a friend Try to do things you enjoy If these feelings continue to affect your daily life and you feel as though you cant function then yes go to your primary doctor They can help you I work in a clinic you would not be the first person to come in with an issue such as this Good Luck to you No it did not get rid of your herpes They are for life until someone finds a cure You doctor just needs to see you before giving you more medication because you havent seen him in awhile a least you havent seen the prescribing doctor in a while YesHenry Wagner MD told me Pre existing colon disease like Crohns regional ileitis etc I had to have an exam and x rays and I was saying but nothing is sore in there and the Dr said there is not always pain at first weight loss loss of appetite change in taste and smell depression it doesnt you have to have a biopsy performed on you I had a positive lymph node on my neck one that is enlarged for at least a month and had it removed and biopsied The local small town pathologist told me I either had HIV cancer or lymesReally narrowed that down eh So he sent my node to Cornell University to the top lymph node doc in the country thats what he said and the report came back Toxoplasmosis Its a parasite thats harmless unless youre pregnant Im just saying the possibilities are many most are harmless Just make sure your specimen goes to a qualified pathologist Good luck  A spot on your liver is so ambiguous It could be a calcified granuloma or a simple cyst or a host of other benign possibilities A CT scan with IV contrast would be indicated to see if it enhances lights up indicating it has a blood supply That would be concerning but still may be benign If its positive for blood supply probably a biopsy would be next Some spots are just watched and retested in 6 months Thats just my opinion Not a doc Just a retired xrayct tech Not an expert but as I understand it a blood test called CA125 is a screening test for ovarian cancer And on a confusing note my mom who had a complete hysterectomy in her 40s continued to have this test and it came back high all thru her old age She was convinced she had cancer but of course she didnt Until something better comes along Id say the blood test CA125 is what you want PS not sure how ovaries migrate from original position unless something is pushing against them A CT scan andor ultrasound should explain that Just opinion here but maybe its not bacterial or maybe its MRSA Have to consider viral or fungal infection If so then antibiotics would be ineffective Think outside the box Is this a person that has had numerous antibiotics thru their life Our society believes you should get antibiotics for everything whether they are indicated or not Maybe try antifungal or antiviral med if nothing else is working Immune system is probably compromised already so last ditch might be steroids Just thinking to myself Hope this helps Bless you I have what sounds like the exact same thing I ended up going to one of the free clinics sponsored by the cancer center for breast cancer awareness and got it looked at even an ultrasound done on it They said that it is not a real concern unless it were a hard lump and ultrasound confirmed it was just a random buildup of fat and tissue I have had mine for about 4years now still there and still the same size If it were to change in size or get hard then I would definitely get it looked at again Yes Cancer is just the overgrowth of immature cells If concerned talk to your doctor right away not necessarily but it could be a cist which sometimes does hurt when touched I just had a tumor removed this past july in small intestine and doc said I was fine and he got it all and I had no cancer and insured me and even called my wife to insure her as she didnt believe me seems I was still having hard time and doc told me my body has been through a tramatic surgery and also ripped an artery down there and I was bleeding internally and had to have emergency surgery that night to have it tied off so I believed the doc but went a few weeks later to diabetic doc and she sent me for full body scan and seems I have more as it has spread lower so I go see an oncology doc on the 15th in my prayers No not at all yes Ask your Doctor there are things you will need to address before that question why do the cramps get worse at night You need to talk to your mom or an adult you trust Dont let this wait There are lots of reasons other than cancer for lumps but early detection is the best And yes I am a breast cancer survivor Its possible they removed all the cancer during the surgery I had a lumpectomy and they got the cancer and all surrounding tissue Yes it is possible that he might got infected because of having Oral Sex can pancreatic cancer be found by checking your blood get a mammogram ASAP to rule out cancer See your doctor too might be an infection too yes can a person have pancreatic cancer without having a tumor on the organ I have the symptoms but no tumor based on a ultra sound will this cause back and leg pain I am not a dr but am a cancer survivor All cancers can cause white blood count to go up When white count is elevated it means its fighting an infection or disease of some kind I have bipolar II disorder and Poly cystic Ovarian Syndrome I have done a lot of research and have learned that some of the medications used to treat Bipolar disorder can cause Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome Whether it can cause cervical cancer I have never read a study that linked the two Did your friend have HPV I believe more than 60 or 70 of the population has it and it can cause cervical cancer Showing all the classic signs or symptoms of it I would say yes they should have but this is just in my own opinion By the way so sorry about your friend I think it can be but not always I would go in to have a biopsy done of it I have been having a feeling like a bubble in my throat for a couple of monthsnot consistently but it happens for a couple consecutive days then goes away for about a week I did have an issue about 8 months ago taking a prescribed antibiotic that had caused a burning in my throatbeing it felt that it may have temporarily lodged there for a couple of hours since then I have been getting this bubble feeling off and on In 1967 nine months before multiple myeloma was active the doctor found the disease in my fathers blood stream work He was 56 years old 1 12 yr later he died The cytoxin chemo was ineffectiveThe only successful relief occurred during radiation from which he suffered pneumonia New drugs and especially stem cell theraphy were not yet discovered My father suffered although silently He lost bone off his spine as he became shorter In the final hospitalization the family was told that although he was given blood transfusions the blood would clot and could not circulate and therefore he died My father was a college professor who taught in an old navy duplex wooden lined It was often sprayed for insects Twenty years later the multiple myeloma occurred Five years after this the professor who taught in the room across from my father died of multiple myeloma also yes it is normal my father also had this and is 2 yrs out with continuous issues they informed him it was because of the radiation First of all dont think that just because youve lost weight and feel sick in the morning means you have cancer You must try changing your lifestyle a bit like eating healthy food and exercising to see if your condition improves If not then you must speak with a doctor first before jumping into conclusions It could be a pinched nerve or possibly some connective tissue damage It is much more likely that the problem is related to your weightlifting injury than lung cancer If you are still lifting weights its probably a good idea to give it a rest and work on stretching and healing not necessary consult doctor immediately "}
