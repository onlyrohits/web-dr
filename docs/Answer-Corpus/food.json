dirty dozen according to the Environmental Working Group Peaches Strawberries Apples Nectarines Pears Cherries Red raspberries Imported grapes Spinach Celery Potatoes Sweet bell peppers Finding the cause for your low potassium needs to be the first objective Here is a list of some possible reasons for low potassium 1 Sometimes low potassium is a symptom of some other problem For example having low magnesium l evels can be a contributing cause for low potassium It may be difficult in these cases to stabilize potassium levels until magnesium levels are increased Routine serum blood studies do not always uncover low magnesium 2 Consuming foods that are insufficient or lacking in nutrients necessary to maintain potassium at an optimal level can be a real challengeYes consuming foods that are rich in required nutrients is a worthy objective But due to hectic life styles and the frequent fast eating of fast foods your diet may comeup lacking in potassium 3 Some medications can cause low potassium levels Be especially careful in taking laxatives and diuretics which can deplete potassium levels 4 Electrolyte imbalances as seen with vomiting and diarrhea can also cause potassium levels to plummet 5 Some digestive irregularities as seen in conditions like Crohns DiseaseGluten Sensitivity issues and Irritable Bowel Syndrome can cause fluid loss and ultimately to cause low potassium levels 6 Drinking alcoholic beverages to excess drinking large amounts of tea coffee and soda can cause excessive urination and result in potassium depletion Here are my recommendations as a lay person who has had family members suffering the negative effects of having low potassium levels   Start a food diary listing as best you can with only a few days until your followup appointment all foods and beverages that are being ingested Also annotate any physical or emotional symptoms like excessive sweating feeling anxious muscle cramps lightheadedness thirst and overall body weakness  For the immediate time follow your doctors plan of action Keep that appointment with your doctor to follow up with the results achieved  Show your diary to the doctor along with an updated list of all prescription medications and over the counterdrugsThat person has been highly trained in nutrition pharmacology and medical conditions Digestive problems absorption defects low magnesium levels and many other problems may be uncovered by your physician who is also a diagnostic detective  Once the cause of your low potassium level is determined then an effective treatment plan may be started Dietary considerations certainly play a role in individuals that experience loose bowels on a frequent basis But other physical and emotional disorders could also be causing your symptom There are a number of the over the counter medications used to treat diarrhea and loose stools Although I prefer the liquid form the pink medication indicated in your question is as good as any of the other products on the market Another popular OTC product is Loperamide HCL 2 mg Caplets I recommend the less expensive pharmacy or grocery store versions over the brand name medications They typically show the words  Compare to the active ingredients in fill in the blank prominently on the packaging These over the counter remedies are not intended for long term use to treat chronic episodes of loose bowels or diarrhea Loose bowels is an important symptom associated with many medical disorders For loose bowels that do not improve over the course of several days  it is recommended that you consult with a doctor for their evaluation possible dietary change suggestions diagnostic testing andor referral to a gastroenterologist specialist It is also prudent practice to consume a diet rich in bulk to drink plenty of water and to engage in moderate exercise activities in order to maintain optimum colon health The answer to your question is debatable Some people swear by it myself on the other hand wouldnt accept it even for free Canola Oil may stand for Canadian Oil in honor of its developers Most of the worlds canola crop is genetically modifiedYears ago there was a cheap oil used for industrial purposes called Rapeseed It could not be used in food back then because it contained a bitter taste and had a substance in its makeup that caused heart disorders in lab animals A group of Canadians scientists wanted to change Rapeseed into an editable product and found a way to create a seed with less of the offending agents Today Canola Oil is manufactured using extreme heat causing a buildup of unhealthy trans fats a possible dangerous solvent chemical called hexane and a questionable deodorization procedure Some studies have reported that up to 5 of the Canola Oil product is made of fatty acids that contain unhealthy trans fats Artificial trans fats are very dangerous to human beings and have a negative association with heart disease about the world I cannot endorse canola oil I think that it has an unfriendly taste and probably even more of an unfriendly affect on our bodies I suggest that you discuss your diet objectives with a physician and also your significant other Your doctor has had positive experience in knowing what diets work and which diets usually do not work They also will know what is the best diet for you as an individual Your medical professional is in partnership with you to ensure dietary efficacy and safety Your significant other in life is also probably your best friend will be a cheerleader in your corner and most likely will offer you the motivating support system that is routinely missing with most diets The diet that boasts the greatest statistical success is probably Weight Watchers Counting points is relatively easy the food is easy to obtain and online supports are built into the dietary system Do not skip meals drink plenty of water and negotiate rewards for yourself such as new clothing upon reaching pivotal goals If you have a dietary setback dont let it be your reason to throw in the towel As the old Chinese Proverb suggests Fall down 7 times get back up 8 times  Some studies suggest that following a nutritious diet may help a diseased liver to perform better and for a longer period of time and even help somewhat in restoring normal tissue The following foods are suggested It is recommended that you talk to a nutritionist and discuss your medical challenges along with foods that you like and do not like They can customize a diet that will help to improve your health without sacrificing great taste  First thought that came to my mind in reading your question was Your doctor must be an outstanding physician to have ordered a CAT SCAN of your liver Now you need to do your part in staying physically and emotionally well Your job at the moment involves staying calm and not reading too much into the higher than normal liver enzymes Please read this HIGHER THAN NORMAL LIVER ENZMES CAN SHOWUP IN COMPLETELY NORMAL PEOPLE As your doctor reported the enzymes were only slightly higher than normal You also stated that you feel well Perhaps these lab tests should be repeated to ensure their accuracy Yes it is possible that you have liver disease causing the enzyme elevation but there are many other possible reasons Live expectancy with liver disease can vary greatly depending on the stage of disease progression when it was first discovered Liver disease can be arrested and a normal life maintained You can protect your liver by eating foods rich in vitamins and minerals eat foods low in fat reduce or eliminate alcohol consumption and be cautious about taking overthecounter Tylenol like products Spinach is a great food source that promotes liver health Lets talk about liver enzymes Liver enzymes are normally found within the cells of the liver If the liver is injured or damaged the liver enzymes spill into the blood causing elevated liver enzyme levels The most common cause of high enzyme levels are medications such as statin drugs used to control cholesterol and overthecounter pain medications including acetaminophen Other common causes are hepatitis A hepatitis B hepatitis C obesity and alcohol Some lesser causes include liver cancer hypothyroidism gallbladder inflammation alcoholic hepatitis autoimmune hepatitis and celiac disease The below links are

some day but for now lets focus on doing some living I know that Monday cannot come too soon for your liking But when Monday does arrive no matter what the CAT Scan reveals you will have regained some control back over this medical scare Best wishes for today and every day into the future Most individuals live quite normally after removal of their gallbladderThe gallbladder that had been releasing bile in order to assist in fat digestion no longer is available for that production The good news is that the liver also produces and releases some bile to assist in fat digestion Many surgeons after removing an individuals gallbladder will request their patients start out with a clear liquid diet and gradually start reintroduction of solid foods back into their diets as they feel better and as tolerated Fats are usually to be avoided during this fist month as the liver will adjust to its new role of leaking bile into the system for fat digestion After the first month following postsurgical removal of the gallbladder most patients can resume a normal diet My cat had a serious urinary condition about 10 years ago The vet wrote a prescription for cat food that I received by mail The entire process of obtaining prescription renewals ordering the food online waiting for the shipment and paying outrageous amounts of money became too stressful for me As a result I began using 9 Lives Plus Care  It is the one that shows a picture of Morris the Cat on the package labeling The Del Monte Pet Products Company advertises their product to be Advanced Nutrient System with the following claims The benefits since starting 9 Lives as his food source have been apparent to the cat and to me because he loves the food and has been medically free of further urinary problems at the age of 14 is active and thriving 9 Lives is available at most larger grocery stores in both a dry and wet varieties My cat prefers the wet style that is loaded with gravy The cost for 9 Lives is actually lower than many other brands Note  I have no financial interest in promoting 9 Lives I just love my cat and he responds positively to their products Having giddiness feelings while thinking of something unpleasant may in itself be an inappropriate laughter response But experiencing negative neurological symptoms accompained with giddiness needs to be assessed by a medical professional The type of euphoria that you detail is typically a result of drug abuse or taking medications that are producing emotional sideeffects tic conditions tourette syndrome where outburst of laughter can occur anxiety sleep deprivation and other emotional and physical disturbances I suggest that you have a conversation with your family doctor who may order blood testing and complete a through evaulation of both your giddiness and balance defects That person may then refer you other medical professionals such as a neuroligist or psychologist to determine an exact diagnosis and treatment Blood worms can be dangerous They lay eggs inside of the human which can hatch and grow After development they may cause intestine and urinary system bursting  Corn syrup is a sweetener while corn oil is a fat Corn syrup is produced after corn oil is removed from the corn The common feature of both products is they have their origins through the corn corp Corn syrup is sweat and may negatively influence the insulin production in humans It is insulin that helps regulate appetite Through a manufacturing process some foods products are made with an even sweater version of corn syrup called High Fructose Corn Syrup Corn syrup and High Fructose Corn Syrup are big business entities and come with much controversy concerning their overall consumer health safety Corn oil is primary used as a frying agent and is valued for its high burn point Some studies have suggested that Corn Oil may prevent cancer The jury is still out on those claims of Corn Oil being superior to Olive Oil as a healthy substance Two or more days must pass after the inflammation and pain has subsided The pancreas needs to rest with nutrition and medication being received through IV administration nothing by mouth is permitted during these critical few days of intense healing After the crisis period has passed liquids and small portions of a soft diet are started If this diet is tolerated well over a few days four to six small mealssnacks per day of a more normal consistency are begun If chronic pancreatic was diagnosed then long term dietary changes must occur These changes in diet may include low fats and the reduction or elimination of fried and barbequed foods With either acute or chronic pancreatitis the drinking of alcoholic beverages is usually discouraged Pancreatitis can be life threatening my brother died a horrible death from this disease In order for recovery to occur dietary sacrifices must be a large part of the treatment process I hope that this answer has been helpful and that you feel better soon  it depends it can be problematic if not enough nutrients are taken in you need a certain amount of calories and protein per day as long as your getting the necessities then its not really a problem definitely food containing no seeds or nuts How are you doing with your issue I feel like this is really rare and you probably would know by now if you have this PraderWilli Syndrome will give you an unsatisfiable craving for food if you are born with this you will have had this eating problem your whole life Vitamin D3 comes in a very small gel cap I would ask your doctor first but Vit D3 is great for absorbing almost anything I take 10000 IUs a day but 5000 IUs is a normal dose and very safe and is good for heart immune system and absorbing calcium too Plus so many other things in our body including our circulation Hope this helped Be well YOU ARE DIABETICmaybe its because you ate whatever you wanted to I did and now Im living with diabetis Why would you want to eat more sugary foods or whatever you want AGAIN That is the most ridiculous thing I ever hear a diabetic person say No you cannot eat more sugary foods and you shouldnt want to Enough said I think Prior to the discovery of insulin there was no way for people with IDDM to survive without the hormone The sugar sickness was a wasting syndrome which left people with insulin dependant diabetes unable to process foods People were treated with diet restrictions or starvation diets in order to help them survive This condition lead to early death In 1922 healthcare providers were able to treat this condition with insulin The drug was first mass produced by Eli Lilly and later by Novo Nordisk Insulin is currently produced by a technology that uses human insulin or proinsulin genes that are injected into yeast or E coli These can mass produce a human form of insulin which is used to treat diabetes It depends on what type of seasoning or pepper used when cooking the food If you use something like mild banana peppers used on hoagiessubs the breadlettuce and meats drown the hotness However if a jalepeno or habanero pepper are MUCH hotteryour food will be extremely spicy Found it

is up to you actually your baby when you transition from puree to chunks of food Most start to like chunkier food around 9 months but others start later As for the bottle many parents start introducing whole milk in a sippy cup at 12 months and most dentists prefer to have kids off the botlle by 18 months In 2004 the Institute of Medicine made a general recommendation of 91oz a little over 11 cups for women and 125oz over 15 cups for men of total fluid intake each day There are some things to keep in mind however Its estimated that 2025 of your fluid intake comes from the food that youre eating For example lettuce can be around 95 water carrots 87 and broccoli 91 In fact most of the foods that you eat contain some percentage of water even things like bread The majority of our fluid intake comes from the liquids we consume Things like tea juice or coffee do count towards that total fluid intake each day Although there is a net gain some liquids that contain caffeine act as a diuretic meaning that it makes you have to urinate so there will be some small water loss due to that Prolonged physical activity or heat exposure will also increase water losses and may therefore raise your daily fluid needs One way to determine your level of hydration is to look at your urine which should be fairly clear If your urine is a very dark yellow then you may need to be drinking more water The primary approach to properly managing acid reflux shouldnt be in promoting certain foods instead of others but rather in identifying and avoiding foods that trigger symptoms Basically you shouldnt focus on what to eat but rather what to avoid In that regard here are some of the common foods that can trigger acid reflux  Fatty foods  Acidic foods like citrus fruits or tomatoes and tomatocontaining products  Coffee caffeinated beverages or alcohol  Chocolate or peppermint  Spicy foods I would suggest keeping a journal to write down your dietary intake daily so that you can notice trends and so that you will be able to identify potential triggers as you notice symptoms Also its recommended to refrain from lying down after a meal eating too much in one sitting or eating too quickly Quitting smoking and losing weight may also alleviate symptoms If you are experiencing acid reflux symptoms remedies might include over the counter antacid tablets or prescription medication Certain alkaline foods may help to neutralize acid reflux but its more important to prevent acid reflux from occurring in the first place by avoiding triggers Please visit the WebMD HeartburnGERD Health Center for more information The Food and Drug Administration FDA regulates what claims a product can make The following are a few examples to answer your question  Free  This term means that a product contains no amount of or only trivial or physiologically inconsequential amounts of one or more of these components fat saturated fat cholesterol sodium sugars and calories  Low  This term can be used on foods that can be eaten frequently without exceeding dietary guidelines for one or more of these components fat saturated fat cholesterol sodium and calories  Lowfat  3 g or less per serving  Lowsaturated fat  1 g or less per serving  Lowsodium  140 mg or less per serving  Very low sodium  35 mg or less per serving  Lowcalorie  40 calories or less per serving  Lowcholesterol  20 mg or less and 2 g or less of saturated fat per serving  Reduced  This term means that a nutritionally altered product contains at least 25 percent less of a nutrient or of calories than the regular or reference product However a reduced claim cant be made on a product if its reference food already meets the requirement for a low claim  Light  This descriptor can mean two things  That a nutritionally altered product contains onethird fewer calories or half the fat of the reference food  That the sodium content of a lowcalorie lowfat food has been reduced by 50 percent The FDA is the organization in charge of making sure that food manufacturers provide accurate information to consumers There are regulations on some of the health claims that products can make and stipulations with some of the terms that they use For instance reduced means that a product must contain at least 25 less of the nutrient or calorie amount than the regular version and good source must contain 10 to 19 percent of the Daily Value for that particular nutrient Unfortunately as far as I can tell there doesnt currently seem to be any specific guidelines for the term real In some instances products that claim made with real fruit for example may actually contain little if any actual fruit In 2012 a California woman filed a class action lawsuit against Fruit RollUps because it claimed to contain real fruit  for its strawberry flavor but contained no actual strawberries only pears from concentrate even though strawberries were pictured directly on the box Its very easy to be misled by food product packaging My recommendation is to carefully examine the product by reading the ingredient list and nutritional label to discern if the product is making the appropriate claims Visit the following for more information httpwwwfdagovFoodIngredientsPackagingLabelingLabelingNutritiondefaulthtm This is a very interesting question There are several factors that determine how long it takes for food to pass through your digestive system To start the type of food matters Some foods are more complex requiring our body to work harder and to take more time to break them down and digest them On the other hand other foods wont have to go through such a rigorous process and may be digested and metabolized relatively quickly Fiber for example has a decreased intestinal transit time which means that it spends less time in your intestines and may be passed through faster than something else The answer also could depend on other factors like age ethnicity and gender You have to consider that peoples digestive systems can be different or work in slightly different ways Did you know that some people have longer intestines than other people Certainly that might influence how long it takes for food to digest Also individuals may have different levels of microbes present in their intestines that can influence how food is digested too How long it takes food to digest depends on a lot of different factors Some fast food restaurants are making an increased effort to offer healthier alternatives to meet a growing demand for healthy food You still need to be very careful with your food choices when eating out since some items that may look healthy may actually be a poor nutritional decision The only true way to determine which foods are healthy is to examine the nutritional information Some fast food restaurants are beginning to put calorie information on their menu but its probably still best to do research ahead of time Most restaurants have the nutritional information for their menu online so it may be good to examine the menus for places that you frequently visit ahead of time to pick out a few of their healthiest options This way you will know ahead of time and will be able to make an informed decision Also keep in mind that portion sizes are typically skewed towards being larger than necessary at fast food restaurants So be conscious of how much youre eating and try to refrain from getting your order as a meal which usually comes with fries and a soda Instead try bringing your own water and a piece of fruit to complement your meal Itll be healthier and it may even be cheaper First we have to talk about prevention We can protect skin from ultraviolet light externally by using a sunblock But you can do things like not smoking Smoking damages the elastin that helps keep facial skin flexible Sleep is important in making sure skin gets proper rest to heal itself Skin cells turn over at a rapid rate and they need time to replenish and rebuild As for foods or nutrients that reverse aging vitamin A is certainly one of those and it comes from a variety of sources Carrots apricots nectarines sweet potatoes egg yolks and even some green things like spinach and broccoli Collards are a great source of vitamin A Vitamin D  your skin converts sun into vitamin D but a lot of people have this sun phobia You can get vitamin D from fortified foods like orange juice and milk Research is showing that the lowly mushroom is also packed with vitamin D Vitamin C is critical for wound repair  for any type of tissue maintenance  and that applies to your skin Tomatoes citrus kiwi  theyre all great sources A number of things could be causing this Everything from a hiatal hernia to esophageal cancer You need to see your doctor right away as this could be very serious Are you having any other symptoms I would strongly suggest your fiance to go see his doctor immediately Especially if he still has his gallbladder as an intolerance to greasy foods is a good indicator of gallbladder problems It could also be a problem with the way his body is absorbing food However if he no longer has his gallbladder and this is the only symptom he is showing he could always try eating more fiber as well as taking peptobismol before the meal That would help but I would advise he consult his doctor as this could be a sign of a bigger problem The effect of foods and beverages on the bladder is not understood but elimination of one or all of the items listed below may improve bladder control It is recommended that eliminating these foods on a onebyone trial basis may help reduce urinary incontinence in some individuals They are  Alcoholic beverages  Citrus juices  fruits  Beer wine  Highly spiced foods  Carbonated beverages  Sugar honey  Milkmilk products  Corn syrup  Soft drinks with caffeine tea coffee even those that are decaffeinated  Artificial sweetener aspartame To see if any of the above products are affecting your bladder stop them one at a time and see if your symptoms improve Its starting to come back in vogue to utilize a slow cooker or crock pot In general I am someone who likes to get great healthy food on the table fast I dont always do well with things that are slow However the amount of time it takes to prepare ingredients for the slow cooker is fast and I like that you dont have to think about it again until its time to eat Here are some tips on ways to revitalize flavor reverse bad past crockpot experiences and have a healthy savory meal that is not an overcooked pile of mush The first and most important tip to having a delicious crock pot meal is to choose the right type of ingredients This is where you should utilize ingredients that take longer to cook like traditionally tough cuts of meat These include brisket pork butt or an entire chicken By the way these are traditionally less expensive meats So if you are trying to budget for meals this is a great way to help with that  or if you are trying to budget for organic ingredients this is where you can upgrade to organic or natural cuts of meat When cooked for so many hours these tougher meats taste great and fall off the bone easily And you get the added benefit of pulling nutrients from the bone If youve had a bad experience with a crock pot most likely youve participated in the biggest mistake Do not use canned vegetables in a slow cooker Period Ever Using canned vegetables in a crock pot recipe will simply turn your meal into a vegetable smoothie Canned vegetables are already overcooked when they are put in the can Cooking them for another 68 hours will disintegrate them Potatoes carrot onions and other firm veggies do well in a slow cooker Using canned tomatoes is fine  mostly because you will probably be using them in a sauce so they hold up well Absolute nonos canned green beans canned corn and canned peas Actually let me go ahead and advise you to never use these canned vegetables if you can help it Underseasoning is another mistake I see people make all the time Since the food is cooking there for so long  the equivalent of a long slow boil  there needs to be a few levels of flavors There are a couple ways to do this If you are making a meat or bean dish I suggest sauting savories like onions shallots or garlic in extra virgin olive oil first before you put in the crock pot The flavors seep into the oil better if you take this extra step Also add freshcut herbs at the very end or a squeeze of lemon or lime to brighten up the dish and give fresh flavor quickly Add ingredients that are high in flavor For example fireroasted tomatoes or fireroasted chilies Another tip is that adding a half piece of bacon cut into small pieces will add tons of flavor without all the fat A half piece of bacon has about 15 grams of fat depending on the size Not bad for adding another dimension of smoky delicious flavor Can you tell Im a fan of bacon Here are some easy crock pot tips for the ultimate chicken soup Take an entire chicken quartered and bone in cover with enough water to cover the chicken For every four cups of water throw in a 12 inch piece of ginger root and about 4 whole garlic cloves Then add carrots celery and onions and cook for eight hours on the low setting or four hours on high At the end add fresh cut parsley and a squeeze of fresh lemon The slow cooker pulls out the flavor in this traditional soup in ways that you wouldnt experience if it was cooked quickly And not only do you get the nutrition in the bones but the chicken falling off the bone You can also use the slow cooker for a healthy delicious breakfast Throw in steel cut oats and water and about a teaspoon of cinnamon and slow cook over night You can also add dried fruits like apples or apricots  these will rehydrate and add great nutrition and flavor Yes its slow but worth the wait Enjoy the delicious benefits of your crock pot while winter is upon us Losing the extra weight that may have crept on over the holidays or the last year will be much easier if you look at what to kick out of your refrigerator and freezer and what to bring in A simple rule to follow is if you need a PhD to decode a label it is best to skip it Refrigerator items to kick out Lowfat mayonnaise check the ingredients  less fat but more sugar and chemicals Just use less of the real mayo Fake butter spreads loaded with synthetic ingredients Again use a small amount of the real thing Soft drinks diet and regular Processed lunch meats American cheese Salad dressings with hydrogenated oil Canned Parmesan cheese Candy bars Sugary fruit juices and drinks Refrigerator items to bring in Organic milk if you are going to do only one thing organic start here Kefir Real butter Plain yogurt Freerange eggs Real cheese Hummus Preservativefree pesto Fresh fruit such as apples citrus melons in season and grape tomatoes Fresh vegetables such as broccoli carrots sweet potatoes celery garlic and onions Leafy greens and fresh herbs such as arugula parsley cilantro basil rosemary mint and dill Nitratefree turkey Braggs liquid aminos use in place of soy sauce Grainy mustard Miso and tofu Unsweetened juice mix with sparkling water for a soda substitute Sparkling water I always recommend organic dairy items if available and possible Freezer items to kick out Frozen prepared meals with high sodium and synthetic ingredients Frozen treats with hydrogenated oil dyes and corn syrup Freezer items to bring in Frozen organic berries Frozen bananas Frozen sweet organic corn peas and edamame soy beans A few onepound packs of chicken breast tenders Wrapped sandwiches for lunch Homemade soups sauces and pestos Wholegrain bread and English muffins sprouted preservativefree breads like Ezekiel 49 can mold quickly when left in the pantry or on the counter As I have said before  if you are ready to make a big change you can start with these guidelines otherwise make some small changes every week I have worked with so many families that feel better cleaning out the fattening synthetic and unhealthy items in their kitchen I encourage you to do the same Here is to a healthy fresh start to 2011 I find the same mistakes problems and trouble spots in pantries from celebrities to stayathome moms We all need a little refresher on why certain ingredients and products are counterproductive to our health goals What lurks in our pantry can range from highcalorie highsodium foods to chemically ladenfood substitutes that have no right being there And as we all know if it is there we will eat it So the first step is always to get rid of those tempting empty harmful and tasteless things weve collected and simply  toss them Do it at your pace Ready for a complete overhaul Great  otherwise start slow Lets identify the biggest problems  the worst ingredients  and move from there Toss Foods with artificial sweeteners hydrogenated oils bleached flours dyes and high fructose corn syrup also toss any peanut butters filled with sugar corn syrup and hydrogenated oils while you are at it toss potatoesinabox and instant rices Bring in Extra virgin olive oil canned beans whole grains kosher salt tamari balsamic vinegar pure maple syrup natural peanut and almond butters and dry spices granulated garlic cinnamon cumin curry powder peppercorns A moment more on spices  if you have had the same dry spices lurking in your cabinet since you were a kid it is time to throw these out Otherwise you might as well be putting dust on your food Dry spices do have a shelf life  do a tastetest on your new spices vs your old spices and you will see what I mean As much as it sounds clichd and boring I have to say start with hydration Water water and more water As many of us know when we are dehydrated our hunger pains go up What feels like an empty stomach is actually us being thirsty A tip to make yourself more likely to keep up with your water intake Fill a large bottle at least 24 ounces with water fresh mint leaves and thinly sliced lemon lime or orange Not only will the visual make you feel like you are at a spa you will be much more enticed to care for yourself and consume what you need to stay hydrated for the day Make sure that you get your intake of fresh fruits and vegetables I know I may sound like a mom right now because I am but I can assure you when we fill our plate with colorful fresh foods we are on a road to a healthier new year Can you add some wilted baby spinach with a splash of fresh lemon juice or balsamic vinegar to your chicken steak or fish tonight Try out a kale or chard recipe Start making a choice every day this week to cut one thing out that may be on your indulgent list and add two things in that are for your health I cant count how many people around me are coming down with a winter coldflu Im in the process of trying to boost up my immune system and fight the good fight and not end up in bed for a few days The odds are stacked against me Half of the people at my restaurant have been sick as well as the kids at my daughters school and Ive been on six flights in the past 10 days I can feel the colds lurking around and waiting to pounce I usually remember to amp up my vitamin C intake when this season starts to come around I add 1000 mg of the powdered form to water with fresh lemon juice two to three times a day There are things we can do to try to up our chances for staying healthy getting enough rest keeping our hands washed and drinking plenty of water are the top three The good news is there are many foods in our kitchens that are beneficial to keeping our immune system strong and in fighting condition At the top of the list are 100 percent orange juice preferably fresh squeezed Avocado Tomatoes Bell peppers Broccoli Garlic Grapefruit Lean meat Yogurt or kefir not one too high in sugar The great thing is you can use these foods throughout your day A glass of fresh orange juice and yogurt is a healthy start to the day You can add avocado tomatoes and turkey to a salad or a sandwich on wholegrain bread for lunch For dinner I love to make a broth with lots of slivered garlic when I feel a cold coming on Ill use already made organic chicken broth and sliver about 34 cloves or garlic and add a lot of lime or lemon to the broth If I have fresh ginger I will grate this into the heating broth as well Finely chopped up broccoli is perfect tossed in at the end Add a couple of cups of baby spinach to 4 cups of broth as well or thinly cut up kale or chard This will give an additional boost of vitamin C Another use for grapefruit is in a salad You can toss avocado and grapefruit segments with mixed lettuces Add extra virgin olive oil and fresh lemon juice salt and cracked pepper for a healthy delicious salad that will be on your side in a fight against a cold Chia is packed with essential Omega3 fatty acids as well as 10 more antioxidants than blueberries It is also high in dietary fiber Chia doesnt have any particular flavor One of my new favorite ways to enjoy chia and all it has to offer is by using it in a drink When you soak the seeds for a few minutes they become gelatinous There is a new wave of Thai iced tea drinks with tapioca balls called bubble tea or boba when you put chia seeds in a drink it becomes a miniature version of this Thai drink I am currently enjoying a mix of pomegranate juice fresh lemon and lime chia seed mint and agave I use one tablespoon of chia seeds  cup of pomegranate cherry or cranberry juice unsweetened  lemon wedge of lime leaf of fresh mint optional Place chia in large glass pint size with juice and squeeze of lemon and lime and agave omit if you prefer tart and up to 2 tablespoons if you like a sweeter drink Let sit for 35 minutes Add mint leaf ice and fill rest of glass with water Stir and enjoy The chia will help keep you feeling hydrated and fight off hunger You can soak 2 tablespoons of chia seeds in 2 tablespoons of water and add into your favorite muffin recipe or other baked goods for extra health and moisture Try this with my pumpkin muffin recipe in Momalicious  You can also add chia to your breakfast cereal hot or cold You can find chia seeds in most health food stores on line and in some grocery stores Look for foods that are high in omega3 fatty acids such as almonds and salmon Olive oil is also excellent for the skin There are studies that show that Mediterranean diets and diets high in citrus fruits help keep the skin looking younger and also help against skin cancer I would also recommend avoiding foods that are highly processed and high in refined sugar  these are proinflammatory for the skin and accelerate the aging process Avoid excess alcohol which is dehydrating to the skin Look for foods that

There is nontoxic free range etc I pack nuts and wholegrain cereal hot and cold in my office desk and power bars in my purse Why So Im prepared should I need a satisfying snack to tide me over Sometimes you are caught in traffic or you need to work past the lunch hour on a project Things happen but hunger waits for no one The key to a great snack is choosing a whole food not processed that contributes calories along with nutrients and some fiber Now Im adding some bags of dried fruit to my office snack stash Sun Maid offers a wonderful dried fruit option with 3 grams of fiber per 14 cup serving  Sun Maid Mixed Fruit Sweet apricots plums tasty pears and apples are ripened by the sun then dried and packed in foilfresh zipper bags The result is super moist and delicious dried mixed

phytochemicals Sun Maid has two other dried fruit options with 2 grams of fiber per 14 cup serving  Goldens  Cherries and Fruit Bits New research found that LDL bad cholesterol is lowered most when plant sterols are consumed in smaller amounts more often throughout the day rather than in one large amount each day In the group of people who received plant sterols three times per day their LDL cholesterol decreased by 6 which was attributed to a significant reduction in cholesterol absorption in the small intestine The average American diet contains around 250 to 500 milligrams of plant sterols per day but some research suggests striving for 2000 milligrams Plant sterols are found naturally in small amounts in many plants food you know and love including whole grains fruits nuts and vegetables But the foods that have impressive amounts include Avocado 1 small  132 mg plant sterols Soybeans 1 cup  90 mg plant sterols Chickpeas 12 cup  25 mg plant sterols Almonds 1 ounce  34 mg plant sterols Extra virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon  30 mg plant sterols Produce can become contaminated with salmonella shigella or E coli during growing harvesting processing storing or shipping Its particularly important that you wash your spinach lettuce tomatoes sprouts and melons before handling or cutting them Wash all fruits and vegetables under running water before eating cutting or cooking unless theyre packaged and marked prewashed Produce with a tough outer skin like melons and cucumbers can be scrubbed with a clean produce brush and warm soapy water before you cut into them  just in case there is bacteria on the peel Unwashed hands are the most common crosscontamination agent between raw meat poultry seafood eggs unwashed vegetables and readytoeat foods according to a study on food handling behaviors published in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association Wash your hands longer and more often than you think you should Scrub hands together vigorously for at least 20 seconds with hot soapy water It takes that long for the soap and scrubbing to remove some of the germs Magnesium is found in nuts and beans certain leafy green vegetables broccoli and spinach and potatoes smaller amounts are in whole grain foods meats seafood and milk The more we know about nutrition and health the more it seems we need to eat the way we did a hundred years ago Recent research is pointing us in the direction of eating mostly whole foods foods in as close to its natural form as possible Consider the following whole food switches Whole grains instead of refined grains whenever possible Fruits vegetables and beans instead of a supplement containing fiber or vitamins A skinless chicken breast cooked with healthful ingredients instead of chicken nuggets made from processed chicken with added fats flavorings and preservatives A baked potato with chopped green onions and light sour cream instead of sour creamandonion potato chips Fresh berries added to hot or cold whole grain cereal for a naturally sweet breakfast instead of berryflavored pastries or breakfast bars A smoothie made with blueberries yogurt and frozen banana instead of a blueberry slush or flavored drink Eating more whole foods is one of the easiest routes to improving health and preventing disease Vegetables fruits whole grains nuts and seeds and legumes are great examples of foods that offer a powerful combination of important vitamins minerals fiber protein and antioxidants Whats the easiest way to improve your health and prevent disease Its simple Eat more whole foods and less processed foods Most of us know that its better to eat a handful of nuts instead of a nutty granola bar Or to build a meal around a skinless chicken breast rather than a chicken nugget Or to include a side of cooked red potatoes instead of potato chips or French fries Its even preferable nutritionally to enjoy cooked green soybeans edamame compared to soy powder or some soybased sausage or product that has been processed That was pretty much the bottom line in my book Food Synergy Whole foods have more of the nutrients we want and less of the added ingredients we dont want sugar sodium saturated and trans fat etc but they also have important nutrients and phytochemicals in natural amounts and combinations So what are whole foods These are foods that are eaten as close to their natural form as possible with minimal processing and refinement Examples include fruits vegetables nuts legumes unprocessed fish lean meat oats and other whole grains They can be cooked mind you without being processed Eating a meal comprised mostly of whole foods compared to processed food is more likely to  Offer a powerful combination of important vitamins minerals fiber protein and antioxidants  Contribute smart fats  omega3s from fish and plants and monounsaturated fat from plants The badforyou fats are often added to processed foods and fast food  Pump up the fiber which helps you feel full faster helps fights heart disease and diabetes and helps keep the GI tract moving and happy  Make it easier to cut down on extra amounts of calories sugar sodium trans and saturated fat  Amp up antioxidant plant components or phytochemicals I love red grapes blueberries and nuts because they taste great Now theres yet another possible health benefit to snacking on grapes and sprinkling blueberries and nuts in my hot oatmeal Danish researchers recently reported that the powerful polyphenol resveratrol decreased the production of certain proinflammatory compounds thought to be linked to the development of metabolic syndrome in human fat cells This may have an antiinflammatory effect and potentially improve the metabolic profile in human obesity Does it work Back in 2003 resveratrol started gaining attention when Harvard researchers reported resveratrol could activate a particular gene the one activated during calorie restriction in certain species and was able to increase the lifespan of yeast cells Since then animal studies have continued to link resveratrol to longer lives Other studies have reported possible actions from anticancer and cardiovascular benefits to antidiabetes and protection against Alzheimers These recent encouraging results need to be repeated in humans studies but in the meantime you cant go wrong eating rich food sources of resveratrol because youll find it in the following whole foods we all should be eating more whole foods and less processed food anyway  Grape skins and seeds  Grapes and grape juice particularly red grapes  Red wine and dealcoholized red wine  Blueberries  Nuts and peanuts Have you had your resveratrol today Source International Journal of Obesity 2010 vol 34 pages 15461553 Do you ever open up the refrigerator or pantry door and just look inwaiting to be inspired by something sitting on the shelf Christine R Gerbstadt MD RD spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association suggests keeping an arsenal of healthful foods at eye level in the fridge such as washed and readytoeat fruits and vegetables string cheese lowfat yogurt and pantry such as wholegrain high fiber cereal wholegrain crackers nuts and dried fruit So I tried an experiment with my family this week I placed some tempting teenfriendly items at eye level in the refrigerator  tasty yogurt cups cut raw veggies and string cheese I must admit those items did seem to fly off the shelf a little quicker than usual Healthful items to consider placing at eye level in the fridge  Readytoeat fruit apples or orange wedges melon cubes pineapple berries etc  Readytoeat vegetables baby carrots celery sticks cucumber sticks zucchini coins jicama sticks broccoli or cauliflower florets etc  Soy milk or similar or lowfat milk  Yogurt or yogurt parfaits  Lowfat cheese stick or cubes serve with fresh fruit lean meat or whole wheat crackers  Selfserve green salads made with dark green lettuce or spinach to be dressed with an olive oil vinaigrette Im sorry your wife is dealing with  Its not a fun problem to have thats for sure You may have seen advertisements or information about various diets that purport to help cure or prevent skin conditions such as eczema or psoriasis Unfortunately no causal dietary link to these skin conditions has been proven That means its unlikely your wife can improve her outbreaks by changing what she eats Its possible you have read about the  which is under investigation by several researchers Some evidence shows that infants with eczema go on to develop food allergies However this does not mean that food allergies cause eczema The links between foods and skin conditions are still being investigated Your wife may seek medical treatment for her eczema Topical prescription creams often help clear up outbreaks Home remedies for eczema include taking cool showers instead of hot ones and applying moisturizer generously There may be some link between stress and eczema outbreaks so encourage your wife to indulge in activities that help her relax  such as getting a massage Wishing you well Im sorry youre going through this especially during the holidays Its natural for a person to gradually stop eating and drinking over the course of their final days or weeks As the body winds down it no longer needs the sustenance or hydration it required in the past It is hard to watch a loved one stop eating and drinking I know because Ive been through it It was hard for me even as a nurse But I hasten to assure you that your loved one is not suffering from this decline in consuming foods and liquids Your loved one probably is not feeling hunger or thirst sensations anymore and this is normal However they may become upset or agitated if urged to eat or drink when they dont want to So rest assured your loved one is not suffering during this time The body is performing all the normal and necessary tasks of  As to how long someone can last there is no good answer When a person completely stops taking fluids the end usually is quite near  usually within a few days A person can go without food for a much longer time If you have questions about the dying process please dont hesitate to ask your hospice nurse He or she should be able to answer all your questions And remember the hospice team is there for the family too Use them as a highly skilled and knowledgeable support team Again Im very sorry youre doing through this I wish you your loved one and your family peace at this stressful time  has a cottage cheese appearance in the mouth Usually creamy white spots dot your tongue or inner cheeks Most of the people Ive worked with who have thrush say its quite painful Thrush is basically a yeast infection of the mouth It is caused by the candida fungus It can be caused by uncontrolled diabetes HIV or even something as simple as taking antibiotics You may be experiencing thrush or you may have something very common called  These usually occur along the lip line vermilion border or just inside the lips This condition is benign not lifethreatening If your tongue is numb or painful and covered with white spots you probably should get checked out by a doctor If youre running a fever you definitely should get checked You cant selftreat thrush so if you do have it you need to get a prescription mouth rinse I hope this helps Any time an infant or toddler eats or drinks something that is not made for human consumption you should call the poison control hotline at  Write that phone number down and post it on your refrigerator for easy access You should call your pediatrician for advice about your childs fever and runny nose Its doubtful the plant food caused this but we are into flu season and flu can be very serious in a oneyearold You need to get this situation assessed as soon as possible If your baby is not eating or drinking take him to the emergency room If your baby is not producing a wet diaper at least every 3 hours get him to the emergency room Plant food contains various chemicals that are highly unsafe for anyone to consume eatdrink These things also are unsafe for your pets to drink so you should find a way to prevent them from doing so Perhaps place a mesh cover over the Christmas tree bowl so they cannot reach the water or something Wishing you well Has your brother seen a medical professional for the symptoms you describe He obviously was diagnosed with an enlarged spleen and fatty liver disease but has he been seen for the vomiting and weight loss If your brother vomits up everything he eats or drinks hes at serious risk for dehydration You shouldnt allow vomiting to go unchecked for any period of time Unfortunately a forum like this isnt a place to receive a diagnosis Its impossible to tell whats going on with your brother without doing a physical examination and possibly some lab tests Could the vomiting burping loss of appetite and weight loss be related to the enlarged spleen Probably not Could they be related to the liver problems Maybe Or they could indicate some other illness or disease entirely Your brother needs to see a doctor to find out for sure Any time a person is experiencing symptoms like unexplained weight loss we get a little concerned It could be something minor or it could be something serious Theres no way to tell without a physical exam Wishing you well What youre describing cottage cheesebumps is called  That cottage cheese appearance is harmless and basically is caused by highly enlarged fat cells very near the surface of the skin While theres no cure for cellulite despite the many preparations creams and techniques touted to rid you of cellulite forever in general the appearance of these fats cells diminishes as you lose weight Your best bet to fight cellulite is to lose weight by eating a healthy balanced diet in the right proportions and to get some exercise You can start off easy but simply walking for 10 minutes a day Gradually increase the time and intensity of your workout and youll see the pounds melt away  along with the appearance of that cellulite Check out for tips and advice from experts and your peers to help you lose weight in a healthy way and keep it off for good All the best to you This is a great question Im glad you asked In general has been found to survive as long as 4 weeks and possibly longer on various surfaces We know this because a team from Clemson University once tested the 5second rule of dropped food on the floor They found that food dropped on the floor can be contaminated with salmonella almost immediately upon contact So youre wise to be concerned with salmonella contamination from surfaces particularly the car seat because salmonella seems to like porous surfaces However bleach is an effective disinfectant against salmonella Chlorine bleach will kill salmonella pretty much instantly So as long as youve cleaned everything with bleach you probably dont have any residual salmonella contamination on the surfaces your turkey contacted In terms of frozen turkey transferring salmonella it may be possible Freezing doesnt kill necessarily kill salmonella Bacteria that survive freezing may ramp up reproduction when they thaw out So you were right to take precautions against crosscontamination even though the turkey was frozen It sounds like you did everything right However I would advise you to bleach that cloth car seat It might ruin the coloration of the fabric I know but because salmonella has been shown to thrive in nylon carpet fibers it would be good to decontaminate that car seat for the safety of your little one Hope this helps So sorry your daughter is going through this It must be miserable for her I would suggest taking her to her pediatrician to rule out any physical cause for this vomiting If she checks out OK physically then I would question whether she may be suffering from anxiety Anxiety in school children is not uncommon And anxiety about going to school definitely could cause a child to vomit You might talk with your daughter to see if shes being bullied or if she is nervous about school If anxiety is the problem just talking may give her relief You also might talk to the school counselor This can be a good starting point Wishing you and your daughter all the best Well Im happy youre in a good mood anyway Its hard to tell whats causing this Could be youre having some postnasal drainage from your sinuses thats temporarily affecting your sense of taste Or perhaps your nose is stuffed up our sense of taste greatly influenced by our sense of smell Or it could just be that youre not hungry It happens sometimes If the problem persists to the point youre not meeting your required caloric intake you should see a doctor Otherwise its probably safe to take a waitandsee attitude about whether this will clear up on its own or not Meanwhile make sure to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids Hope this helps I think youve answered your own question It appears in your case that highly acidic andor spicy foods trigger your diarrhea Apparently your digestive tract doesnt care for those types of food Its possible you have some type of  IBS is not a single condition The term encompasses many different types of well irritable bowel problems Your bowel irritation may or may not be a sign of some underlying medical condition Your best bet is to try eliminating the foods you know cause the diarrhea and see if it clears up the problem If it does you probably dont need to investigate further If eliminating the trigger foods doesnt clear up the problem then Id suggest you see a medical professional for an examination and possibly some further testing Hope this helps This is a great question The concept of a therapeutic  diet has been floating around for a few years now but there is no scientific proof that diet in any way affects psoriasis That said an individual may experience certain food triggers that cause psoriasis to flare up and these should not be ignored Keep in mind triggers are specific to the individual person If for example eating tomatoes causes your psoriasis to flare up it doesnt mean if your friend with psoriasis eats tomatoes his condition also will flare up You should beware of any diet programs that claim to cure psoriasis There is no scientific basis for this Hope this helps Im sorry to hear your granddaughters going through this especially at such a young age Im obviously not a doctor but the first thing that comes to my mind when you describe your granddaughters symptoms is  In this condition a persons stomach does not empty as quickly as its supposed to Even though gastroparesis is not common Ive known several people with the condition All of them said they experienced pain in the upperright quadrant and all of them were frustrated that physicians told them pain is not a symptom of gastroparesis In my opinion gastroparesis is not wellunderstood by most physicians If your granddaughter ultimately is diagnosed with this condition I suggest you find a specialist to help her She will need someone with deep knowledge of this unusual condition in order to help her learn how to meet her nutritional needs with a stomach that chronically malfunctions Note Im not attempting to diagnose your granddaughter with gastroparesis Im only saying this is one possibility of whats going on based on the information you provided It may be worth checking into this possibility more  or at least getting it ruled out Wishing you and your granddaughter well Oh ouch Thrush is a painful condition so you have my sympathy Im assuming you were given a prescription rinse to clear up the infection Meanwhile Id recommend you eat things that are soft and cold Thick liquids like yogurt or an ice cream shake will probably go down well as will gelatin I would avoid anything salty or brittle like crackers certain cereals etc These items not only will hurt going down but can cause micro tears in the delicate tissues of the throat The good news is the antifungal mouth rinse should clear up the bout of thrush in no time Take care Well its a good question Motivation is the challenge of every person who wants to achieve a goal be it weight loss becoming an oil painter or anything else It sounds like you may have invested too much time and effort into research Everything feels overwhelming to you right now doesnt it Dont let that stop you At a certain point you have to take the plunge and DO IT Stop thinking about it and just DO IT I read an interesting article in which a fitness coach said there is no such thing as motivation there are only choices You can choose to eat an apple or you can choose to eat a candy bar You can choose to take a walk for 10 minutes or you can choose to watch TV instead Do you see the difference here I strongly suggest you and your friend check out WebMDs  where you can share your fears struggles goals and with others who will cheer you on You are not the first person to fear getting started on the path to a healthy life and you wont be the last Meanwhile choose goals you know you can easily accomplish For example Today I will eat one apple instead of a candy bar Today I will throw away all the junk food in my house Today I will walk for 10 minutes This week I will walk for 10 minutes every day I mean come on Anyone can do 10 minutes of exercise right Of course you can Lastly dont forget to reward yourself for meeting your goals no matter how small they may be  Dont use food as a reward Even if you accomplish just one thing today download a new song to your smartphone take a bubble bath or do something else to celebrate the fact that today at least YOU WON You dont need motivation You just need to take the plunge I say go for it Wishing you well Im sorry to hear this Its hard when we feel food choices are being taken away from us Im glad to see you can differentiate between an intolerance having an undesirable reaction to a true allergy hives anaphylaxis etc Big difference I wish I could tell you why these food intolerances seem to be coming on all at once Its certainly worth getting the situation checked out by a doctor I can tell you that it takes exposure to develop an intolerance or allergy so perhaps your body just reached its exposure threshold with certain items and is now reacting badly to them Here is some general information on that might be helpful You might start with your primary care provider to see if he or she can provide any insight I wish you all the best Assuming youve been cleared by your primary health care provider to exercise you should be OK to simply eat a wellbalanced diet that includes fresh vegetables and fruits lean protein whole grains and healthy fats like olive oil Be sure to stay wellhydrated by drinking plenty of water too Also remember that it takes time to build up to high intensity cardio training No beginning exerciser immediately has the stamina to run a marathon For some people 10 minutes of cardio is enough to begin with Youll gradually work up to longer and more intense sessions I suggest you visit the  where you can ask questions of others and get support on maintaining a healthy lifestyle Take care Pregnancy hormones can play havoc with appetite causing some women to feel famished Others are daunted by nausea vomiting and fatigue that diminish their desire for food In both cases the best strategy is trying as much as possible to adhere to a balanced diet that accounts for physical activity and stage of pregnancy like the ones offered at MyPyramidgov A nutritious pregnancy eating plan with adequate calories  about 340 more calories each day than your prepregnancy needs starting in the second trimester and about 450 more than your prepregnancy diet during the last three months of pregnancy  should be enough to prevent constant hunger Women who are particularly physically active during pregnancy may need more calories however Choosing foods that fill you up as part of a balanced pregnancy diet improves eating satisfaction For example whole grains vegetables and legumes are filled with fiber to keep you fuller for longer without any extra calories Drink plenty of fluids it works with fiber to keep you full and to prevent constipation a common pregnancy complaint i would try getting a can of thick it you can get it at walmart but i suggest getting it online it is so much cheaper My grandfather has been drinking it and it has helped a lot easy to use and is not nasty to drink  What foods should be avoided if I have Graves Disease I am not a fitness expert although I work for them but I wanted to offer an answer from my own personal experience I had this same question not to long ago I exercise 34 times a week eat healthy have 4 kids and 3 dogs who I run after or with all day long But I was stuck at my target weight Im 56 I wanted to be 145 Made it down to 165 from almost 190 about 6 months ago My trainer also a good friend of mine said I needed to stop looking at the scale and focus on what was most important Being healthy and enjoying life Im not a dr but have you gone to one to see if there is a medical reason to explain this My friends daughter is 13 and weighs 230 pounds I was keeping her for awhile and decided to help her lose some of the weight The first thing I did was not allow her to make her own plate She thought she knew about portion sizes but really she was putting way too much food on her plate A sample breakfast could be a scrambled egg with some spinach a meat for protein 1 sausage and a glass of orange juice Or since youre young you might only have cereal for an option so pick a cereal thats healthy and without all that sugar An ex could be Kashi or something like raisin bran The second thing I did was teach her about nutrition Her mom is 300 pounds so I knew there was no one there who knew either If you ball your hand into a fist thats the size of your stomach Thats how much food can actually fit Anymore than that then youre stretching your stomach out The more you cut back on eating the more your stomach goes back to the size its supposed to be Third which should probably be first but I wanted to get her eating habits down first is exercise exercise exercise You have to exercise Skipping at school or PE isnt enough I walked with her everyday for 30 minutes She didnt think she could do it but I stood by her every step of the way and encouraged her We were even able to start doing it twice a day Hopefully at some point we can speed walk then start jogging Fourth you have to drink tons of water Sometimes your body might feel like its hungry when youre actually thirsty A good rule of thumb is to start off with64 ounces a day To help you measure use a plastic water bottle to fill your cupsglasses and thats how you can keep track Fifth which should probably be higher is to make sure you eat enough healthy foods I made her eat 2 servings of vegetables with every meal Her snacks were fruit Also a good time to say eat 57 small meals everyday and when I say small I mean the size of your fist small You are not too skinny for your size your perfect weight would run around 130135lbs except your monthly weeks youll be a little bigger 510lbs Dont do it because thats whats expected go to the size that makes you feel happy Good Luck There is no way to speed up the process of getting your period so do your best to enjoy your time without it Think of all the great things you can do without worrying swimming without worrying about pads vs tampons going to sleepovers without dealing with Mother Natures gift wearing white whenever wherever You dont have to be concerned about planning your

vitamin C folic acid and intrinsic factor Generally this medication is well tolerated especially when the directions are followed including taking this medication as directed by your physician It may be taken with food or a meal if stomach upset occurs Take each dose with a full glass 8 oz or 240 ml of water unless your doctor directs you otherwise Swallow it whole Do not crush or chew Do not lie down for 30 minutes after taking this medication It is important not to exceed the recommended dosage The common side effects for this medication are constipation and stomach upset This is largely due to the iron component and can be minimized by eating a meal when taking the tablet and by using a stool softener for extended complications with constipation If all the instructions have been followed and the side effects become more intense you should consult your health care professional You may also consider working with your pharmacist to find an alternative medication There are several brand names for this vitamin that you could try to see if you experience lesser side effects Iron is also formulated as a slowrelease product Hello There Hello There I am also 54 and female I cannot tolerate yeast eggs wheat rice and marjoram coming on also in the last year in addition to existing intolerance to dairy and soy Those two came on when I was 40 and 41 I always blamed the giardia infection I had when I was 30 After scopes and xrays my gastroenterologist says that my GI system is healthy If this helps  you are not alone I went to doctor today for the same thing and was told it is a cist at the top of the thyroid and if it gets large it will need to be removed Hello I have four kids One of them is two she is a spitfire She often cries for little to no reasoning behind it Its because she is developing she realizing that her actions get reactions She isnt doing it to get on your nerves or drive you insane  although can I say from one mother to another sometimes it feels that way However I do want to suggest that your little one may have food allergies This can cause a great deal of unhappiness and not wanting to eat I knew someone who had them and it took years for there parents to figure out that was why he was always crying and fussy I would say take her in for a check up and explain that you want her tested for food allergies If she is allergic and you get it under control it will change your life It is perfectly reasonable that she conceived and you are the father based on the timing you described It was 9 days following the 26th that she found out she is pregnant Women typically ovulate 1015 days after they started their last period and pregnancy tests can detect the pregnancy 5 days from the day she was supposed to start her period Therefore timing was likely just right and she was a few days out from starting her period Would you like nitrates with that This is the question that we need to start asking ourselves when we walk through the grocery aisle order in a restaurant and particularly when we feed our children More data emerges every day which challenges our previous notions of the relative significance of particular fats or micro nutrients Doctors and nutritionists are focusing more on how our food is made Processed food contains high amounts of salt nitrates and other chemicals used as preservatives and flavor enhancers  most of which the typical person knows little or nothing about While this is old news recent data is emerging that suggests that the processing may pose more of a health risk than previously recognized A few months ago I blogged about a study that suggested that saturated fat intake was not clearly associated with future risk of heart disease  this research contradicts some of our commonly shared recommendations and has forced the American Heart Associationand other organizations to seriously rethink not only our recommendations but how we come to arrive at them Common wisdom is taking an appropriate backseat to research So I was excited to read about a more recent study which tries to tease apart why foods high in saturated fat would appear to be associated with an increased risk of heart disease Harvard researchers examined the results of 20 different studies involving 12 million people They found that eating unprocessed meat think steak or unprocessed pork or lamb was not associated with any increased risk of heart disease but eating processed meats like cold cuts sausage and bacon was linked to a 42 increased risk of heart disease and 19 increased risk of diabetes They specifically looked at the saturated fat content between the unprocessed and processed meats and didnt find much of a difference But nitrates and salt might account for some of the disparity All it took was a typical serving a day like a hot dog or some sliced cold cuts in a sandwich to reach this risk When you consider the number of people who have bacon for breakfast most days of the week or have a ham sandwich for lunch every day the impact of processing is impressive The authors of the study also make the point that unprocessed meat may also have other noncardiac health risks such as colorectal cancer and other malignancies Many Americans tend to accept processing antibiotics and hormones in their food without much of a fight  these additives may make our food more flavorful and likely cheaper as well But it seems as thoughprocessing may come at a price  an increased risk of heart disease You can take some steps to reduce your risk by avoiding bacon sausage and all deli meats

sounds like you have a condition which causes you to not properly digest your food it doesnt even sound as if your food is going to your digestive system at all instead you are swallowing it and before it reaches your digestive tract you are having a reaction to it Talk to your physician and see if he can prescribe something you could have something simple called acid reflux where your food is trying to come right back up before even reaching your digestive tract Regardless of what is causing it you need to consult your doctor and let him run some tests Meanwhile you need to stick to a

lot on when to start solids We now know that 4 to 6 months seems to be the best time  when the babys digestive system can handle solids and they dont impact allergies for the worse If you wait until your babys much older than 6 months she may reject the texture I also had problems to see my veins They turned me on my stomach and did the Doppler tests and found this is the only way to see the deep

and it makes foods that I usually enjoy make me want to vomit as well Since it began with menopause I would assume it could be a hormone imbalance however allergies can develop at any time Just a couple of ideas  Yes milk tends to aggravate an ulcer Try to avoid spicy foods acidic foods cinnamon peppermint soda popcorn and chocolate Do try to eat a higher fiber diet this can help heal the ulcer Also cherries celery apples cranberries onions garlic and tea are good to eat Its okay to eat sweets and junk food Theres nothing that says that the body cant handle it You just have to focus on moderation I know people say that all the time and its like yeah yeah please shut up But its true And also if you do have some ice cream or cake have water with it That way the water will make you full so you wont want any more I am not sure how to edit this question so I am posting it here Fiber is not an issue I get plenty of fiber in my diet Anything that is acidic like sodas or caffienated beverages I was diagnosed with this illness when I was 15 years old I wasnt allowed to have caffeine or fried foods A bland diet would be best Believe it or not there actually are some foods that can counteract with medicines today One of the things that I notice even with Allegra is the fact that fruit juices can actually not make the drug work as well  and its not just grapefruit juice Things like orange juice and apple juice just the level of acidity actually doesnt make the drug work as well so therefore Ive recommended patients to not take it with juice or not have juice within an hour of taking the medication Also another popular thing that people do is that they tend to take things like Maalox or Milk of Magnesia if they have an upset stomach and take their pills you know with it or within 20 minutes of it Always good to space it with medicines because these products can actually bind and make it like a cement brick and therefore the pill cant do its job as well because its stuck in this little nasty situation So I always tell people space antacids and things like that by at least two hours Therefore its out of your system and the medication can dissolve and do its job But thats a really common question that we get with pharmacists If you have any questions about specific food products always feel free to ask us We can look it up if were not sure but there is some really good data out there that shows us what medications and what foods might interact If it says Do not drink alcohol which some people may consider a food that is something that I tell people to not do either Alcohol is just a product that believe it or not just makes side effects worse It will make you more tired especially with allergy medications It could cause your stomach to become more upset A lot of people dont realize all the things that it could do for you so basically while youre on allergy medications or really for that matter any medication you should really limit your alcohol use or dont drink at all This is a perfect example of a good question to ask your pharmacist about It is actually advised that you can open the capsules and mix with a sweetened liquid like chocolate syrup not sprinkled on food directly It is always a good idea to ask about medications and how they can be taken when you pick up your medications at the pharmacy You may have to wait a few minutes to talk to a pharmacist but it is worth the wait Hi sorry to hear thatif its more than 2 days now and shes experiencing the same symptoms please take her to a doctor Im a mother of 4 grown children She

indicate that your body has a low iron stores Because you have a high cholesterol level eating foods that have a substantial amount of iron that are not high in cholesterol would be helpful Foods that fit this description include Dark green leafy vegetables such as spinach collard greens and kale Beans lentils and chickpeas Nuts and seeds Iron fortified whole grains in breads and cereals Meats have

spike well there is nothing you can do Even with insulin treatment oral medication and proper exercise he needs to stop with the bad eating habits I have Type II diabetes and although I try to take care of business by blood sugar spikes at times not much and not high but it spikes I had a doctor explain it to me like this If you know of someone that decides to eat what they want not take hishers medication and not exercise you are committing suicideperiod I reduced sources of protein and fat from animal sources to nuts I especially like almonds which are also high in calcium and fiber But be sure to get the unsalted kind It sounds like internal hemrroids When bowel passes through the spincter muscles it could be causing the pain It can simply be heartburn but you should definately not ignore this If you expierience chest pains you should go to an emergency room as soon as possible Especially if its happening often No sweetie it is not normal and I would say that you need to go see

high in vitamin K can affect your INR the test to measure how well your Coumadin is working Foods like kale spinach collard greens and Brussels sprouts all have high amounts of vitamin K While you shouldnt binge on them one day and avoid them the next if you have one or two servings a week consistently you should not notice a difference Calcium supplements come in many forms Calcium carbonate is available in chewable forms and even liquids I suggest you try one of those Also some are available as smaller tablets that are easier to swallow You have to take two of them to get the full dose But they are smaller and easier to swallow I think these are better alternatives to crushing up a regular supplement which would probably taste bad Talk to your pharmacist He or she can help you find a supplement that best fits your needs Wow Sounds like your really working hard and eating clean However to fuel weight loss you need to change your program and your going to be surprised by my suggestions First 1250 calories is not enough for a 60 year old The recommended amount of calories for a 60 year old is 1600 calories for women and 2000 calories for men While these are estimates your pretty far away from both Your body is not going to let go of any fat that it has It believes your starving so its holding on to all the calories it can I know its counterintuitive but up the calories to a reasonable level to lose the weight Add veggies at least one more serving of protein and some healthy fats olive oil avocados eggs nuts olives seeds If your doing eight hours of cardiovascular exercise a week a great deal of it is probably long slow distance training You need to change it up Begin interval training Shorter duration but higher intensity Look at the articles pasted below as they map out incorporating interval training into your fitness planOnce again I know its counterintuitive that less time equals more weight loss but the weight loss is spurred on by the higher intensity Reevaluate your strength training workouts by asking yourself am I getting stronger and am I seeing changes With a caloric intake of 1250 calories your probably not So increase the calories and change your routine Visit the link below and incorporate 1 or 2 of the lifts in each section into your routine Remember challenge yourself  Finally it sounds like your really working hard and initially you probably had success but your body has adapted to the program and its time to change it up Since these suggestions are a significant change in your exercise program be sure to check with your physician especially if you have any health conditions It can be really frustrating when your doing all that work and not seeing the results you want However getting rid of stubborn fat around the waist requires both exercise and good nutrition I know in your question you laid out all the things that you werent eating and that sounds great However since your not getting the results you want its time to gather a little more dietary information so you can suceed webMD has a bunch of tools to help you do just that The link pasted below is for webMDs food and fitness planner page When you visit the page you can set up an account for free that lets you determine how many calories you need a day to take in to lose weight It also lets you record the foods you eat and tracks the calories

you many times people report that after keeping a food diary they actually eat even healthier so they can maximize the number of foods they can eatday For example the average candy bar has about 220 calories A healthier snack of 1 serving of string cheese 1 cup of baby carrots and 12 cup of red grapes only has about 192 calories Eating high quality foodsveggies fruits lean proteins and healthy fats in the right portions will get you where you want to be Also you might find that by getting your diet squared away you can actually decrease the amount of time your exercising You need to have

limited information you provide but what you are doing is problematic and could lead to an eating disorder First and foremost its important for you to eat regular meals at regular times  breakfast lunch dinner and snack Then you need to understand which foods have carbohydrates and how to eat a consistent amount at meals This article reviews carb counting and how it works Once you understand which foods have carbohydrates you can plan meals that are easy to prepare For example oatmeal topped with nuts and fruit for breakfast takes minutes to prepare Lunch can be a tuna or turkey sandwich and a salad and dinner pasta with veggies and a lean protein This article reviews a sample diabetic meal plan I understand that you are overwhelmed and would like a list of foods to eat but it will take some learning and patience on your part I highly recommend seeing an outpatient diabetic educator to learn strategies for controlling your blood sugar There are some frozen meals you can buy once

smaller more frequent meals Avoid high fat foods such as high fat meats fullfat dairy and fried foods Keep portions of fat oil butter nutsseeds small at meals Get adequate fiber through fruits vegetables and whole grains If fiber intake has been low gradually increase it Watch for individual items that are hard to digest such as dairy products and beverages like caffeine Have your daughter

food neophobia fear of new foods its red flag when they only eat a handful of food and act out What is also worrisome is the strain this has on your attachment to your son I recommend that you get an evaluation from an Occupational Therapist or Speech Therapist that specializes in feeding disorders There could be sensory issues or oralmotor problems or another underlying problem especially since you say hes always been like this If nothing comes up go see a pediatric dietitian He or she can help you not only meet your sons nutritional needs but feed him in a way that will make meals more peaceful and him more open to new foods Dont stop until you get the help you need In the meantime do not make food a battle Offer food on a regular schedule breakfast snack lunch snack dinner and follow a division of responsibility where you decide the what when and where of eating and he decides whether or not to eat When he complains or acts out let him know that he doesnt have to eat it but he does have to join you at the table for a while Putting pressure on a child only makes it worse Hang in there It sounds like your diet may be out of balance Make sure to include 35 food groups with main meals and 23 with snacks lean protein whole grains fruit vegetables dairy healthy fats For example a salad with veggies and dressing includes vegetables and healthy fats but that alone is usually not enough to keep you full So add a protein source to it beanschicken and round it a piece of whole grain bread and a side of yogurt The goal is to include foods with a high satiety value meaning they take longer to digest and keep you fuller longer Here are some ways to increase the satiety power of your meals Make sure most of your meals have a source of protein Protein is the most filling of the macronutrients carbohydrates protein and fat So include nuts on your cereal a boiled egg or chicken on salads and build your dinner meals around a lean protein source Include healthy fats with your meals Fat also helps to slow digestion and is satisfying Try chopped avocado on salads nuts topped on yogurt and veggies sauteed in olive oil A healthy fat source at every meal will increase satisfaction Fiberrich foods are also filling Include fruits and veggies with meals as you have whole grains beanslegumes and nuts and seeds While its great to eat healthy make sure you eat meals you enjoy that also taste good That include sweets in moderation A small piece of dark chocolate or cookie after a meal can increase satisfaction and help keep cravings at bay Keep trying different things until you find meals that are not only healthy but satisfying  Im not sure what you mean by days without food If she eats absolutely nothing for 34 days and then finally eats one day that would be problematic You need to make sure her growth is on track by checking with her pediatrician If she eats very few foods and tends to gag or choke a lot then have her evaluated by a feeding therapist speech or OT to rule out oral motor or sensory issues This also might be a sign of an eating disorder  for signs and symptoms see this post If you suspect an eating disorder get her help right away If she is young and picks at food for a few days and then eats quite a bit that is more normal especially if growth is on track The best way to handle this is to provide balanced meals and snacks at regular intervals and make sure she sits for a period of time 1015 minutes Do not pressure her to eat and let her know she doesnt have to  but she does have to sit and join everyone at the table Children tend to eat better with a nonpressure approach feeding Pushing children to eat can cause early fullness and less food intake at meals If there is any doubt take her in to the pediatrician for a double check Good luck Here are some foods that may help prevent urinary tract infections Cranberry products such as cranberries cranberry juice and cranberry extract Blueberries Fresh berry or fruit juices Fermented dairy products with probiotic bacteria ask your doctor about probiotic supplements Cinnamon Foods rich in vitamin A like sweet potatoes carrots spinach and kale The tiredness and aches and pains could be caused by a variety of factors I would start with a physical and blood work It is not uncommon for young women to be iron deficient which could be causing her to be tired You also want to check her vitamin D levels which can be low even when diet is healthy I am not a doctor but wanted to respond to the nutritional aspects Some of the symptoms you list such as frequent urination are symtpoms of type 1 diabetes Im not saying you have it but it is worth being checked out As for the dizzy feelings after sugar its hard to say I would aim to eat balanced meals with a protein healthy fat whole grains and fruits and vegetables If you eat sugar do so after a balanced meal or snack Eating sugary foods on an empty stomach may contribute to the dizzy feelings The best possible thing to do is get a physical that includes lab work to make sure everything is okay In the meantime focus on taking care of yourself by eating well and getting sleep Plant foods store carbohydrates for energy and the ones with high amounts are referred to as starchy foods  also called complex carbohydrates Foods high in starch include potatoes grains like wheat and rice and corn Not all starches are created equal though Although both whole wheat bread and white bread contain the same amount of starch whole grains provide fiber phytonutrients and additional minerals important for health Potatoes contain a lot starch but also a rich source of potassium Starchy foods are important for active people who need a good source of carbohydrates for their own carbohydrate stores called glycogen Some of that depends on the cause of the elevated enzymes But in general for liver health maintaining a healthy weight helps Some research shows liver enzymes may go up slightly after weight loss but its usually transient Focus on eating a healthy balanced diet Studies show a Mediterranean diet may be best  see this article for specifics Such a diet is rich in fruits and veggies beans whole grains nuts seafood healthy fats like olive oil and includes small amounts of meat and dairy Sugar refined carbs white bread cake cookies fried foods and alcohhol should be limited And

issue although there is some evidence that protein intake 23 times the recommended amount contributes to urinary calcium loss and could predispose someone to bone loss People with renal kidney

balanced healthy diet will support your body in building white blood cells There are no specific foods you can eat that will speed up the process Making white blood cells requires a supply of

normal white blood cell count unless something else is wrong A low white blood cell count leukopenia is not due to inadequate nutrition except possibly in cases of extreme starvation People with leukopenia have either a high rate of destruction of white blood cells or the body is limited in making them for some other reason Eating a healthy diet wont build white blood cells faster but does have many other health benefits That depends on your energy reserves in other words how much meat you have on your bones at the time you take your last bite of food Starvation conditions are one of the very few situations when its better to be overweight or even obese A pound of fat contains about 3500 calories enough energy for a day and a half to several days depending on your activity level and metabolism A pound of muscle contains about half that There is no good scientific evidence on exactly how long people can live before starving to death Needless to say that study will never be done Examples of people on hunger strikes who continue to drink water but eat no food show that a healthy person with a normal body weight may be able to survive well over a month without food Survival time also depends on a persons activity level during the fast More activity means more calories burned and fewer available for basic bodily functions There are many reports of obese people

without power if it is unopened Add block or dry ice to your refrigerator if the electricity will be off longer than four hours Thawed food can usually be eaten if it is still refrigerator cold or refrozen if it still contains ice crystals Discard any food that has been at temperatures greater than 40 degrees F 444 degrees C for two hours or more and any food that has an unusual odor color or texture While the power is out keep the refrigerator and freezer doors closed as much as possible to keep food cold for as long as possible If the power is out for longer than four hours follow the guidelines below Use dry ice if available 25 pounds of dry ice will keep a tencubicfoot freezer below freezing for three to four days Use care when handling dry ice and wear dry heavy gloves to avoid injury For the freezer section A freezer that is half full will hold food safely for up to 24 hours A full freezer will hold food safely for 48 hours Do not open the freezer door if you can avoid it For the refrigerated section Pack milk other dairy products meat fish eggs gravy and spoilable leftovers into a cooler surrounded by ice Discard this food if it is held at a temperature greater than 44 degrees F 444 degrees C for more than two hours Use a digital quickresponse thermometer to check the temperature of your food right before you cook or eat it Throw away any food that has a

only 05 mg of trans fats or fat cholesterolfree foods can only have two milligrams of cholesterol and two grams of saturated fat A serving of food labeled low sodium can have a maximum of 140 milligrams of sodium A serving of low cholesterol food can have a maximum of 20 milligrams of cholesterol and two grams of saturated fat One serving of a lowfat food can have a maximum of three grams of fat A serving of a lowcalorie food can have a maximum of 40 calories A serving of a food labeled reduced must have 25 less of the ingredient than a serving of the regular version One serving of a

also want to make adjustments to your diet if you have any of the conditions that are commonly found in people with gout including hyperlipidemia hypertension diabetes obesity and impaired glucose tolerance The primary dietary goal for gout is to limit your intake of foods with high amounts of purine in them Ideally you will have little or no foods that are high in purine and only small amounts of those with moderate amounts of purine Foods considered high in purine content include Some fish seafood and shellfish including anchovies sardines mackerel scallops herring mussels codfish trout and haddock Some meats such as bacon turkey veal venison liver beef kidney brain and sweetbreads Alcoholic beverages Foods considered moderate in purine content include Meats such as beef veal poultry pork and lamb Crab lobster oysters and shrimp Vegetables such as asparagus spinach green peas mushrooms and cauliflower Kidney beans lentils and lima beans Your other goals will be to Lose weight if you are overweight Make sure that you do this slowly because fast weight loss will actually increase the uric acid levels in your blood Drink plenty of fluids This can help with removing uric acid from your blood Be sure to limit fluids with caffeine andor calories water and seltzer are the best choices Increase your lowfat dairy intake There has been some research that has shown that those who drink lowfat milk or consume lowfat yogurt have lower uric acid levels than those who do not Keep your fruit and vegetable intake up You may get a reduction in your uric acid levels by having fruit such as cherries and vegetables those that are not sources of purine as part of your diet Its still important to have a wellbalanced diet Ask your doctor to recommend a dietitian who can design a plan that fits your preferences and lifestyle Its great that you tried to change your diet to help lower your cholesterol While cutting back on red meat can help there are many other foods that you can cut back on or remove from your diet that will have an even greater impact on your cholesterol For anyone with high cholesterol or more importantly a high LDL the three things to limit are trans fats saturated fats and cholesterol Of these three the most important one to limit or completely omit is the trans fats The sources of trans fats are commercial baked goods cake cookies crackers donuts vegetable shortening fried foods some margarines and anything made with partially hydrogenated oil The label will tell you if there are any grams of trans fat in the product but the best thing to do is read the list of ingredients and look for any oil that is hydrogenated The next thing to cut back on would be foods with high amounts of saturated fat The sources of saturated fats are whole milk cheese ice cream butter lard meats creams palm palm kernel and coconut oils The final thing to limit is your intake of foods with cholesterol in them Cholesterol is found only in animal products so if anything that you eat or drink that comes from something that walks swims or flies will have cholesterol in it This means that you find cholesterol in meats fish poultry egg yolks organ meats and dairy foods not in chips and cookies Its important to remember that the cholesterol in food is not the biggest problem for elevated blood cholesterol in humans The trans fats and saturated fats have a greater impact on raising our blood cholesterol level than cholesterol from food does so be sure to read your food labels carefully to check for the trans and saturated fat The most well known nutrient that has been show to help lower blood cholesterol is soluble fiber Foods that are high in soluble fiber are oats oatmeal barley beans peas barley strawberries apple pulp rice bran and citrus fruits You can also add walnuts and almonds to your diet to help lower your cholesterol but remember that they have a lot of calories in a small amount so be sure to set limits on how many you have There is also some evidence that plant sterols and stanols are also able to assist with lowering cholesterol You can find them in most grains vegetables fruits beans nuts and in foods that have had them added to them cereals orange juice and margarines like Benecol There are some people who may not be able to lower their cholesterol through diet and activity alone so its important to work with your physician as you make the changes to your diet to determine if medication is necessary You need to see your doctor right away if you are having trouble swallowing your food There can be many possible causes for trouble swallowing Some can be very serious Here are a few of the things that can cause difficulty swallowing \tThe esophagus the tube that runs from your mouth to your stomach may be partially blocked by a tumor or web It may also be narrow due to severe reflux \tA swelling in a surrounding area such as the thyroid or lymph node may be pressing in on the esophagus \tThere could be a problem with the nerves or muscles that are involved in swallowing \tPoor teeth can be preventing food from being properly chewed \tDiseases such as diabetes or scleroderma may prevent the esophagus from moving the food along WebMD has a very good article on Difficulty Swallowing that can give you some more information But do call your doctor now and make an appointment to have this checked out If it feels like there is something caught in your throat right now you need to get emergency medical help right away The good news is that most people do not have to drastically change their diet when they start on the bloodthinner warfarin Coumadin But you do have to pay close attention to what you are eating The goal is to keep the level of Vitamin K about the same from day to day You can do this by knowing which foods have a lot of Vitamin K and not making any big changes in how much of them you are eating each day Foods that have a lot of Vitamin K include most of the green leafy vegetables like spinach kale lettuce cabbage Swiss chard endive and seaweed Greens such as turnip collard and mustard are all high in vitamin K as well Other vegetables that contain a lot of vitamin K are cauliflower broccoli and asparagus Liver is also high in vitamin K Other things to watch out for include green tea canola oil and soybean oil Peanuts and potatoes do not have a large amount of vitamin K But watch out for cashews and pine nuts They have a bit more vitamin K so eat them sparingly So what does all this mean If you have always had a salad for lunch then it is probably fine to keep eating one every day as long as it is OK with your doctor If you want broccoli or asparagus with your dinner for a change then it would be best to skip the salad that day And remember to keep your portions small Liver has a lot of cholesterol so I would recommend skipping that altogether If your doctor has recommended a multivitamin make sure you take it every day They usually have vitamin K in them as well so you want to be consistent Talk to your doctor before making any changes in your diet Do not take any overthecounter medicines or supplements without checking with your doctor first Some of them may interfere with your medicine Also be sure to get all blood tests done on time Dont be overwhelmed It may seem like a lot to do at first but it will become second nature before you know it You are not alone One out of every 10 people in the US gets heartburn at least once a week One of the most common causes of heartburn is acid reflux This happens when stomach acid washes back up into the esophagus or food tube It is good that you dont smoke or drink These are major triggers for heartburn in many people Acidic foods and coffee can also cause heartburn Some other things that may help prevent heartburn include \tElevate the head of your bed with 6 or 8 inch blocks or use a wedge under the mattress \tWear clothing that is loose around your waist \tDont lie down after eating \tAvoid foods that cause you symptoms Some people get heartburn with fatty foods chocolate peppermint or soda \tLose weight if you are overweight \tEat smaller meals If you have been having heartburn more than once or twice a week or if has been going on for more than a couple of weeks you may have a more serious condition called acid reflux disease or GERD gastroesophageal reflux disease Symptoms of heart disease can also feel like heartburn Make an appointment with your doctor He or she can find out what is causing your symptoms and help you get relief For more information

limelight we actually need it in higher amounts than any other mineral  around 3500mg a day by adult men and women Potassium plays a fundamental role in maintaining the fluid and acidalkaline balance of the body It is vital for the transmission of nerve impulses and helps the heart to beat regularly It also counterbalances sodium in the body and is known to help lower blood pressure To get enough you need to eat plenty of fruit and vegetables which are especially good sources because they also provide a low level of sodium Healthwise its a high potassium to sodium ratio that really counts However several other foods also provide potassium including whole bread and pasta brown rice milk fish and meat The Dietary and Nutritional Survey of British Adults HMSO 1990 showed that the average intake of potassium is 3187mg in males and 2434mg in females Compared with the daily recommendation of 3500mg intakes they are therefore low To make up the difference eat an extra banana or two daily  each banana contains around 400mg People most at risk of marginal potassium include the elderly athletes and manual workers who sweat out a lot of potassium and people taking certain diuretic drugs Heavy coffee and alcohol drinkers may lack the mineral and should try to increase their dietary intake I think from this and other stuff around with your supplements you should be getting there but keep of any fast foods junk foods and sodas just keep eating healthy Do hope this helps Good Luck PS the extra urination is from all the fruit your eating same as the soft stools Hi If you google your

Delayed ejaculation male orgasmic disorder is classed as either experiencing a significant delay before ejaculation is possible being unable to ejaculate at all even though the male wants to and his erection is normal There is no set definition to describe how long is too long but a persistent and unwanted delay of ejaculation that lasts for 30 to 60 minutes may suggest delayed ejaculation Alternatively if you are unable to achieve ejaculation at least half the times you have sex you may have delayed ejaculation As with premature ejaculation delayed ejaculation can be either acquired or lifelong Lifelong delayed ejaculation is less common and affects an estimated one in 1000 men Delayed ejaculation can occur in all sexual situations or just in certain situations  for example you may be able to ejaculate normally when masturbating but not during sex When delayed ejaculation only happens in certain situations theres usually a psychological cause Now when it comes to masturbation if your using a very tight grip then your doing it wrong the vagina is delicate a soft so this is how you should be masturbating you need to masturbate with a feather light touch and use some baby oil

please read on Ironically in the past few years it has become clear that at least half the people who are overweight have impaired iron metabolism detectable on blood tests In many of these cases dietary iron intake was adequate perplexing researchers It now appears that inflammation associated with excess body weight elevates a hormone in your liver called hepcidin which has the net effect of reducing iron absorption into your body from your digestive tract The result is a metabolic nightmare of weight gain fatigue and poor thyroid function Do hope this helps you Good Luck Hi If your a healthy 70 year old and its real good smoked fish or meat and not done with a chemical you should be OK if you eat it within certain boundarys like just a couple of times a week your be ok Hope this

checked I can certainly see your concern however since your pregnancy test was negative it is unlikely that you are pregnant I would recommend that you see your doctor just to make sure since you are having symptoms of being pregnant Your doctor may also do some bloodwork including a thyroid test to see why you may be having the unusual menstrual cycles and the other symptoms which you are experiencing I am having nausea burning and pain I have had an endoscope cat scan and sonogram The sonogram showed two gallstones but the doctor does not believe this is causing my symptoms My primary doctor feels it is my gall bladder giving me problems I cant see a surgeon until 101413 We are leaving for Vegas on the 7th to celebrate our 50th anniversary Am I safe to fly and what should I do or not do especially with the food I am uncomfortable 247 and this has been since the first week in August No My bottom line is buyer beware I think that its good the companies are at least offering better options relatively speaking Id buy something there if I had no other choice And if you have to eat there remember its like walking into a mine field Stay focused and dont be tempted by their typical highfat highcarb fare Food fakeouts That means foods that sound or look healthy but in reality arent Instead youre getting baited with enticing words like lite healthy low fat sugar free or low calorie when youre really buying items loaded with processed foods fat and sugar These fakeout foods carry a phony Health Halo and you need to be aware of the nutrition land mines out there especially at restaurants To help you navigate these challenges here are some examples of food fakeouts complete with Health Halo and tips about how you can adapt and adjust with healthier options Smoothies Problem Something about that word smoothie just makes you want to down one right now Buyer beware Youll often end up guzzling 80 grams of sugar and over 300 calories in the blink of an eye Solution Know what goes into that drink Be assertive Ask for the list of ingredients if its being made for you If youre making one yourself or having one made for you you dont need to drink any more than 8 ounces use water skim milk or yogurt and add fresh fruit and protein powder If youre buying one premade read the label carefully for number of servings per container as well as total fat carb and protein Energy Bars Problem It says energy and healthy and you go for it not realizing that most of these are glorified candy bars You can take in up to 500 calories and never know it Solution If you want to try one read the label Make sure the total calories doesnt excess 200 the total fat is not more than 10 grams and no more than 4 grams of saturated fat no more than 20 grams of carb and you want to see at least 5 grams of fiber and 1020 grams of protein I tend to recommend energy bars for those people who really need a snack to carry them over in places where they cant access whole food For instance road warriors who are stuck on planes and trains and travel delays and need a tiemeover food SugarFree FatFree or Lite Foods ProblemThese words will try to snag you every time You see the word free or lite and youre hooked Watch out If a food is sugarfree then its probably loaded with fat and if its fatfree its loaded with refined sugar As for lite that food is lighter relative to what It could be a high fat item thats 10 less in fat leaving it still a high fat item but relatively speaking its lighter Solution Personally I eat real whole foods in balance If you do find yourself in a position of buying one of these fatsugar free or low fatsugar or lite items please read the label carefully If its a lite food make sure the total fat is low and the carb content especially sugars is no more than 20 grams or so and hopefully theres at least 510 grams of protein per serving For the fatsugarfree items watch out for high fat greater than 10 grams and more than 5 grams saturated fat or refined sugar content greater than 25 grams Fancy Water Problem It looks perfectly innocent and heck its water for crying out loud What could be wrong Everything Many of these enhanced waters can be loaded with sugar Solution Read the label Im sounding like a broken record but you need to know what youre consuming Many of these drinks can easily be 125 calories of diet wrecking sugary water per serving If youre an athlete who is really sweating up a storm and is working out vigorously for hours on end then they need these sports drinks to replenish glucose fuel and fortify with electrolytes For everyone else drink plain water when youre working out Salad Bar Problem Youre feeling particularly saintly as you head to the salad bar to grab some lunch Youre entering a field of potential food landmines You pile everything on your plate and munch away without realizing the amount of salt and fat youre ingesting Solution Those artichoke hearts olives and chick peas were usually taken out of cans where they were preserved in lots of salt If you want to consume them wash them first Choose lowsalt options like lettuce and fresh produce like peppers mushrooms onions spinach carrots and cucumbers I have worked with many men and women who demonstrate a fear of food The root cause is psychological and often resonates around control issues complicated by anxiety and depression Youre already quite thin yet you want to drop fat and weight Why Think back to when you made that decision It sounds as though youve had the fear for a while and that you may already be a chronic food restrictor Im quite concerned about your desire to shed weight You absolutely should be working with a therapist who is expert in eating disorders These experts will help you tease apart your unique situation and develop a strategy to create a healthier relationship with food Go to the web site for the International Associaton of Eating Disorder Professionals and find a therapist in your location You really need to speak with someone as soon as possible if you cant find anyone see your doctor and let your medical team find someone for you Food manufacturers know what people like to eat They study taste and change up ingredients to enhance taste That means adding refined sugars fats and salt to so many products  I dont call many of them food but instead foodlike products since theres nothing natural about them There is a growing body of evidence that suggests that there may be two groups of people  those with no history of addiction in their families but they develop addictive tendencies with processed foods they were weaned on and another group that has a strong family and personal history of addiction for whom food is a transference of the addiction you give up drinking smoking or drugs and begin to overeat If you want to feel satisfied and kill carb cravings at the same time then head on over to lean protein That means low fat dairy poultry fish and beans You can also buy whey protein powder at any Whole Foods GNC or Vitamin Shoppe I like to combine vanilla powder with skim milk and frozen berries for a protein shake  two scoops of protein equals 20 grams which is very satisfying Youre probably not eating enough protein Most people overeat carbs especially ones filled with refined sugars Refined sugars white sugars increase your insulin levels through the ceiling and then they come crashing down stimulating a major appetite for more sugar Its a vicious cycle you want to avoid Stick with lots of nonstarchy veggies and healthy fats like olive oil and nuts Just watch out for what I call bingeables  foods that feel addictive to you and you cant seem to have just one And if you have one youll end up eating a mountain of them Finally try to eat a balance of healthy protein carb and fat roughly every 34 hours beginning with breakfast That will help to quell your hunger and appetite as well Check out the USDA label and look specifically where it says carbohydrate and look under it Youll see a breakdown of sugars and fiber If the product says 20 grams of carb and underneath it says 15 grams of sugar run Its jampacked with sugar and has a high GI 4 grams of refined sugar is equal to 1 tsp Every tsp increases your risk for heart disease Check out the cereal youre eating in the morning Avoid the frosted stuff as well as those loaded with granola raisins and dates Added sugars in your diet mount up over time and if youre not vigilant youll be consuming way too much of the white stuff There are several good GI Food list books out there as well as multiple websites where you can learn for yourself what the GI is for carbs youre currently eating As a rule of thumb try to stick to foods that are less than 50 low GI or 5570 medium GI and avoid or minimize high GI 70 food products White bread 7075 White rice 7090 Cookie 5080 Cupcake 7080 Doughnut 7580 Cornflakes 80 Cherries 20 Grapefruit 20 Apple 40 Macaroni and

Research has shown that with the advent of lowfat foods Americans have actually gotten fatter The truth is that a lowfat or reduced fat food may have the same or more calories than its fully fatted rival Thats because if fat is reduced in a food item sugar is often increased Also seeing the words lowfat or fat free is a green light for many people to overeat One study showed that people ate 28 more candies if these treats were labeled lowfat instead of regular Scientists have suggested that people believe that lowfat  low calorie and thus over eat and underestimate the total calories they are consuming One day a woman came to meet me in my office for her initial appointment She was positively mystified as to why she couldnt shed any of her excess pounds She swore she ate only really healthy foods Upon further discussion I learned she did indeed consume smart whole foods Her problem was that she was eating mountains of healthy foods She confessed that she rarely read the label and didnt realize how much food was in a real serving Smiling I said Well you read the label on the clothes youre buying so why not food She got it And I hope you do too Hey its time to know thy food In selecting the food you eat you need to know the quality and quantity of the calories you consume All of us need to mindfully choose foods that meet our individual caloric needs A study published recently in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association found that 616 percent of participants reported using the nutritionfacts panel and 472 percent read the serving size when considering purchasing a product Its important that we all take a closer look at the foods we eat because youll never know what youre eating unless you take a thorough look at the label Reading food labels is one of the first steps to good health You simply cant make an informed choice without reading Thanks to the US Food and Drug Administration FDA all packaged food and beverages carry a Nutrition Facts Label that is chockfull with useful information The FDA also offers a handy little guide that can help you better understand what youre eating Why dont you take a moment and check it out Since so many of us are struggling with extra weight one of the first things we need to think about is the number of calories in the food we choose If you are trying to remove or maintain weight you need a daily calorie budget and a plan for how you are going to make those calories work best for you As with so many things in life weight management requires planning If you fail to plan you plan to fail I like to say So set a calorie budget and begin each day with a plan for how youre going to stay within that budget and what foods youre going to eat Choosing foods wisely has never been easier The government has been extending regulations to make it simple to find the calorie information needed to make knowledgeable decisions on foods and beverages The private sector through initiatives like the beverage industrys Clear on Calories is making calorie information more userfriendly by putting calorie content on the front of packages vending machines and even on soda fountain machines for the very first time In fact starting in 2012 vending machines will have the total calorie count right on the button you push to make your selection It just doesnt get much easier than that Portion size is also critically important  how many glasses are in that bottle and is that yummy muffin one serving or four That information is also on the label and the calories represent the total for a single serving Once youve established the number of calories its important to focus on the source of the calories in the muffin  sugar or fat Saturated or trans fats And what else is in that muffin  how much salt and sodium Lowfat does not mean lowsugar so pay attention to everything on the label Sugar and fat have been part of the human diet for centuries because they give human bodies energy and give flavor to food The body needs a balanced diet The goal is not to flee screaming from grandmas oatmeal cookie but rather to understand how many calories sugars and fats are in those cookies and how they fit your individual bodys needs and can be budgeted for your daily dietary intake So get in the habit of reading labels The FDA has a great cheat sheet that you can print and take with you to the supermarket You dont need to be a biochemist  just a person willing to spend a couple of minutes reading the label on the package of pasta youre about to put in your body There any about more then 18

look every week Are you gaining 1113 poiunds a day every week or is your weight relatively the same every week Your weight can easily fluctuate that much during a single day and that doesnt mean much as far as overall weight goes Weigh yourself once a week and see how your weight looks one week to another My weight usually fluctuates around 812 pounds a day but week to week its usually about the same My boyfriend can have his weight fluctuate as much as 20 pounds a day but his weight stays about the same one week to another Remember to weigh yourself at apporximately the same time every week for example weigh yourself first thing in the morning BEFORE you eat every Friday or something like that Weighing yourself multiple times a day will only make you frustrated believe me I know Good luck Smoking can cause foods to taste more bland Also I know cutting out sugar from your diet will allow your tolerance to go down and the flavor will be stronger again for example powerade used to taste very bland to me i cut down on soda and started drinking water a lot the next time i tried a powerade the flavor was overwhelming I am not an expert and am only answering from my own experience Even back to when I was younger I can remember always being hungry and always eating People used to comment on how much I ate and that I didnt gain an ounce I also try to eat healthy and love vegetables Two years ago I was diagnosed with hypoglycemia low blood sugar not due to diabetes Especially around the time of my period my blood sugar is hard to control I feel like Im starving and of course crave chocolate I usually give in and then that starts a viscious cycle with my blood sugars I try to have a variety of vegetables fruits cheeses peanut butter and whole grain snacks wheat thins triscuits etc on hand So if you are feeling the signs shaky dizzy weak grouchy feel like you could eat a freakin cow LOL you may want to have your blood sugars tested CONGRATS ON THE BABI Have you considered a bit of tough love  intervention may be the solution here As in go in  get rid of all the junk food He may get angry he may ban you from his home even his life but in his quiet lonely moments he will know the truth in what you did  it will continue to speak to him until he listens Thank you for you feedback it is greatly appreciated I honestly feel really good about myself and think i look good I am really developing a complex though with all the comments of how much weight I lost and how skinny I am I do realize how shocking it must be for people to see me lose weight so quickly and im just tired of hearing all the comments Im also concerned with why my appetite just totally diminished then came back with such a vengeance and why I cannot seem to gain any weight with the amount of calories I am consuming on a daily basis Did I mess up my metabolism also I am not extremely active so it just doesnt make sense I know that this is probably a great problem to have but Im just not used to this sudden change in my body We know aspirin interferes with blood clotting so people go off aspirin for some period of time But often patients dont know that some of the other medications they are taking without a prescription again or even with prescription may interfere So we have a list of over 200 medications over the counter and prescription that are known to contain elements that would interfere with blood clotting and we give it to the patient well in advance of the surgery and say look through this list and if youre taking any of these please stop or lets talk about And we ask very specifically on our questionnaires what medicines are you taking both prescription medications and nonprescription medications We are trying to make sure the patient doesnt forget or doesnt disregard the importance of these medications that could interfere by the way not only with the bleeding but even with the anesthesia There are certain drugs that the anesthesiologist would be very unhappy if he didnt know the patient were taking But its not just supplements and prescriptions What about foods Well garlic and ginger for example when consumed in large amounts can cause some change in clotting yeah so we tell people about it We tell people those things that would get them into trouble By the way foods can also help us though because papaya and pineapple rich in an enzyme called papase which is the same thing that is in meat tenderizer after surgery very good because they help digest the red cells that cause bruising When you see a bruise its because the red cells in the blood have seeped into the tissues and it helps digest them So you know foods can work for us and they can also work against us But we need to know This is the most important thing And this is why its so important to have a very complete evaluation by the cosmetic surgeon a very complete evaluation by your personal doctor so that none of these things would slip through the cracks We dont want anything slipping through the cracks An anesthesiologists worst nightmare is that the patient took a drug that the anesthesiologist didnt know about and that drug was in the patients system and could interfere sometimes significantly with a safe anesthetic Your question is loaded with subsequent questions there is really no way for a person that does not know your medical history to give you a legitimate answer Many different problems could cause these symptoms such as hypoglycemia hyperglycemia diabetes or it may just be something as simple as the sort of diet that youre on and lack of necessary vitamins needed by the body I am going to take a shot in the dark and assume youre in the Navy I am a veteran myself and during my time in the Army one of the things they used to do was forced hydration You need to be careful of the amount of water youre taking in without replenishing your body with necessary electrolytes I do hope this has been helpful however for a more detailed answer you should visit your clinic and speak with a Dr who has your medical history they may also want blood work charts You need to get another tetanus shot Yes the vaccine lasts ten years but not to the day or month To be safe get another one and you will be good for ten more years The vaccine is 100 effective and tetanus the disease is just about 100 fatal so it pays to be safe Babies need to be on formula OR breast milk for ONE YEAR  After a year as long as they get all of the calcium phosphorous and other nutrients that are in milk and are eating a good wellbalanced diet they do not really need it Milk and milk products yogurt cheese etc continues to be an excellent protein source and should not be abandoned unless there is a milk allergy or other medical reason to do so There is no whey that this added protein alone will build muscle Extra protein  above and beyond his nutritional needs  has the potential of overloading his kidneys especially if he is sweating and exercising and not getting in sufficient water All he needs to do is eat a good balanced diet three meals and some healthy snacks work out regularly no power lifting weights and he will get strongerand leaner He does NOT need something stronger like those bulkbuilders at the health food stores No acne is not caused or worsened by certain food or drinks This is a common misconception Acne is caused primarily by hormones that cause an over excetion of oil often made worse by certain bacteria found in acne lesions If your eight year old is having acne she may be starting to puberty which can occasionally happen this early She should see her medical provider Sugary drinks and sodas can make her fat but they will not cause zits One possibility of many would be dyshydrosis or dyshydrotic eczema This common skin condition can cause itchy clear blisters to form on your fingers often between them or in the web space This condition assuming it is what you have is treated by topical steroids hydrocortisone and avoiding overly exposing your hands to water dishes frequent handwashing etc As you know without the ability to physically SEE these little bumps that this is just a blind guess Remember I know it is difficult that the one year old is not in charge Offer her two sources of liquid milk or tasty juice in a sippy cup and water in a bottle Allow her to choose When you wash the nipple on the bottle dont rinse off all of the soapa little will just add a strange taste or you can clog the nipple a bit so she has to really strain to get anything out of it Kids are smart She will figure it out but you may have one rough day over this first of many to come struggles with a strongwilled child Next Potty training in about a year Offer her plenty of her favorite foods at meals and snacks See your medical provider or gynecologist There is a more sensitive blood pregnancy test that you can have And yes because there may be other causes for your array of symptoms including your late or missed period you should be carefully examined and those other causes should be investigated Changing the consistency of your stools by eating more fiber could conceivably eliminate your hygiene issue Firmer stools are not sticky or adherent As far as that final paper work is concerned go for 100 even if you have a take a shower Some people will buy and install a bidet and washing basin that is designed for this very purpose Use commerciallyavailable moistened wipes will make your job a bit easier and perhaps more thorough If you find that you are leaking stool after a bowel movement it would be good to see a colorectal specialist not your primary care provider for higherlevel examination No this type of mold will not make you sickexcept maybe a little from looking at it Maybe she wants some real food like many of the things you are eating Many babies reject processed baby food Have you tasted it so try preparing some of your own or start feeding her some safe foods from your plate She doesnt need teeth for many of those things Dont give her too many different foods at one time remember that breast milk or formula is still very important and follow her pediatricians recommendation on when to start safe solids but now may be the time She watches what you eat so this may be her way of saying How come if have to eat this stuff in a jar FYI My daughter did the same thing No harm as long as the person using the hot sauce is not feeling any discomfort on their mouth or tongue and does not have an gastrointestinal responses like diarrhea If hot sauce was harmful there are a lot of people in various cultures that routinely use hot sauce on everything Mexican Thai etc that would be experiencing physical harmand they are not One of my friends child was swearing so his parents would but a drop of hot sauce on his tongue as punishment He liked it too Andhe is still swearing like a sailor Moody and loss of appetite does not necessarily mean it was caused by the Depo Provera injection There are hundreds of things that can cause these vague symptoms It may have just been a coincidence that the symptoms began after you last injection If the symptoms persist see your medical provider for a proper examinationdont just assume it was the Depo You can basically eat anything you want  your normal diet whatever that might be Your body will respond if this stomach virus is still rearing its ugly head For instance if you get nausea or diarrhea again you may have to eat a bit more reasonably for a few more days Viral infections last about a week but most people feel better on day four I dont think your work place with test you for myrrh so unless you have been taking or smoking something else your drug test should be clean Go by his birthday and consider holding back on solids for another month or so His formula is much more important to his overall nutriion than cereal or baby food at this time but get input from his pediatrician There is no need to rush solidshe will be eating for the rest of his life he primarily needs to get his nutrients from the formula A person can have an allergic reaction to just about anythingso that would include food or molds Anytime that you have sex with a woman and CHOSE not to use a condom even if she is on another form of birth controlYOU ARE RESPONSIBLE or at least half responsible since your partner has a say about this too Rather than worry if you are the father or someone else it would be best to recognize the seriousness of this event If your partner is pregnant and it could be you then you need to step up to the plate and support her If your partner does have other partners it can get a bit messy but you cannot really determine if you are the father based solely on a pregnancy test Pregnancy tests are not foolproof so the test can be wrong Partners have been know to lie about the positive results to test your response a very bad practice and sometimes early pregnancies end in miscarriages Be a man In the event that you have created a pregnancy then your life is about to change Dont throw accusatory arrows and forget about the big picture You may be holding a baby that looks surprisingly like you in less than a yearor not Go with her to the doctor for a confirmation test and exam If she is pregnant then eventually you will be able to get an estimate of the date of conceptionbut perhaps not now If it is disclosed in the near future that you are not the father then at least you will be able to hold your head up high and be proud of your personal support during the very trying time You body needs about 15 calories per pound of ideal body weight I do not know what you currently weigh If you eat less and burn more you will lose weight In a chronic situation where you are losing weight your body will attempt to lower your metabolic rate to compensate for this slowing down you weight loss In addition to calories you body needs a balance of protein more for men less for women fat and carbohydrates to achieve optimum health I dont know your sex or what your goals are but it may be best to seek the counseling of a good nutritionist It would not be likely that this one unwashed piece of peeled melon would present any type of risk to you or your baby nor would it be prudent to try and best tested at this point Just let your OB or primary care provider know about this unlikely incident in the event that you develop any symptoms of a foodborne illness Ecoli is the most common bacteria that causes a urinary tract infection UTI Assuming you are a female men rarely get UTIs the bacteria came from your own rectum located quite near the vaginaurethra Bacteria that normally live in the colon can thrive in the neighboring vaginal area as well Since the female urethra is so short it doesnt take much for the bacteria to migrate into the bladder Sexual intercourse often helps it along Every human on this planet has Ecoli in their intestines This is the part of our normal intestinal flora We do not however have the 0157 strain that causes lifethreating health consequences unless we got if from a contaminated source Bloody diarrhea is not likely from too much olive oil so I would encourage you to seek medical care There are many other bacterial forms of diarrhea that can cause this Insurance or not your health is worth spending money just like you would spend money to fix your caror your computeror cell phone I cant really offer you a patientspecific answer over the Internet since hormonal imbalance and nutritional intake resulting in weight gain can be a very complex issue You do need to address this problem with your medical provider a nutritionist or a weightcontrol specialist baritrician You are eating more than you body needs This is the ONLY way other than water retention that a mammal you can put on large amounts of weight We do not pull calories from the air While it may not seem like you are eating more a calorie excess of only 500 calories a day could add a pound a week to your scale a 1000 calorie a day increase could at TWO pounds a week The first step in getting some control is to do an honest and accurate food diary Write down EVERYTHING you eat including the amountsweight and their determine their caloric content Your doctor will likely need this information Unfortunately there are no foods that will increase the volume of your semen The volume will increase if you do not ejaculate for three to four days The vast majority of the ejaculate is prostatic secretions semen and not sperm No Unless the person you had unprotected sex with actually had hepatitis you are not at risk Exposure does not equal contagiousness and you cannot catch a disease from a person simply because they were vaccinated Dont blame college dining hall food Since semen and urine share the same exit you could have a bit of urine after ejaculation assuming this is urine and not a different fluid Without an examination of your guyparts including the prostate I would not know if you are seeing prostatic fluid or not so if this persists you may need to see a urologist While some student health practitioners have skill in this area a urologist would likely offer you the best answer Yes something is clearly wrong with your mother and you are very sweet to be concerned Unfortunately it would not be possible to diagnose your mother let along treat her over the Internet in this forum Your mother will need to find another medical provider to exam her  one that does not think that her symptoms are weird Please encourage her to do so There are sooooo many different reasons to account for her symptoms that it would be impossible to blindly solve it with a simple posting She will most likely need some diagnostic tests so if this involves travelling to find a new medical provider or to have her seen at a larger medical facility this is something you may need to do A skilled phlebotomist can find a vein by just feeling palpating it A visual view is not necessary Apply a warm compress and allowing the arm to hang down prior to the blood draw would be helpful and ask for a phlebotomist that is skilled drawing blood from  They are used to those tiny hardtofind veins I suspect we ALL eat food that may have had insect visitors In most cases you will be just finethe body has a remarkable ability to combat these contaminations I guess it is possible that the roach could carry germs on his dirty feet but you should be fine Exposure to the body fluids of an Ebola patient is the cause Ebola is highlycontagious but it is not spread by foods Fomites fresh fluids on surfaces linens tissues etc contaminated by an Ebola patient can certainly lead to transmission The jury is still out if the virus is airborne but clearly if an Ebola patient coughs those body fluids saliva mucous could contain the virus There are no specific foods that would improve erections but when you life a healthy lifestyle eat well exercise regularly and dont smoke or excessively use alcohol your body will achieve a higher states of wellness and with that wellness will come healthy erections Erectile difficulties can be very complex and have multiple causes There may be some underlying medical or even psychological reasons so a consultation with a health care professional would be advisable I do not know anything about your mother or her medical history but I would be concerned as well I cannot imagine that six days into a potent antibiotic course that she would be having UTI symptoms The vact that her BP is low her heart rate is high and she is having difficulty breathing would not likely be related to the UTI She needs to see her regular medical provider as soon as possible for an examination I dont knowI dont know what medication you are taking so my advice to you to speak with your pharmacist You can have a blood test to see if you have Hep A or have antibodies from a previous infection The Hep A vaccination will not hurt you if you have or have had Hep A in the past There are no heightenhancing drugs or diets Any claims that this can help would be false This young man should have a consultation with a pediatric endocrinologist This is the specialist who can determine if HGH human growth hormone therapy would be appropriate in his particular case There are no magic solutions to motivation but I am pleased that you are doing this with a friend How about a bet Put some money on the line 100 or housecleaning if someone fails to meet their goal they have to clean the other persons house Keep in fun and make sure your goals are reasonable and achievable Start with CONTROL Cut out the things you know you are not supposed to eat and stop buying them Write down everything you eat for about a week or so be honest and try to determine the number of calories you are ingesting Make sure you are UNDER 15 calories per pound of ideal body weight your goal Any one can lose weightthere is only mismatched strategies Something tells me that you are on your way to success Go directly to a urologist This is the person that should be doing the complete evaluation of your ED and loss of penile sensation The kidneys are not really involved in digestion They can eliminate liquid wastes but the food that we eat is digested by the gastrointestinal tract stomach small and large intestines You will lower the salt a little bit but food cooked and canned with salt will likely have salt still in the food You are better off with fresh or frozen vegetableswhere have the control over the amount of salt that is used Exposure to infectious diseases like chicken pox does not mean that you can spread it to others You would actually need to have chicken pox yourself in order to do that Chicken pox reexposure can cause you to get shingles but that would be a different question Your coworkers in food service will not be at risk Some authorities believed that smoked anything is not really good for you Depending on how a product is smoked smoke can contain residue that may be carcinogenic cancercausing It is not your age that is the factor but rather the possibility that smoked food my be hazardous at any age Moderation is the key so an occasional piece of smoke salmon is not the same as a cigarette Raisins are high in iron and they are good for the heart in an indirect nutritional way Assuming your father has a good balanced diet and other reasons for his low iron levels have been investigated he can have a healthy handful every day if he would like You are not describing herpes and yes these very painful ulcers can involve your tonsils A white spot may simply be a tonsillith tonsil stone a common accumulation of food and other debris that can get trapped in little holes on your tonsillar surface Since I cant see it this is only a guess Yesyou can eat just about anything while taking amoxicillin There are a few possibilities First there actually could be something caught in your throat but this would take a thorough examination by an ENT using a fiberoptic scope to make that call Second Inflammation from variety of events including reflux perhaps from a hiatal hernia as you mentioned something compressing your esophagus thyroid irritation from foodmedicinessmoking etc Third It could be psychological but before anyone tries to make this assumptiion ALL organic causes need to be ruled out Here is one source for you or you can buy a good calorie book httpwwwwebmdcomdiethealthtoolfoodcaloriecounter It would not be very likely that you would conceive in this way but to be safe just do a few home pregnancy tests and consider this a lessonlearned This practice is very dangerous sexplay that will eventually lead to intercourse so be prepared Dont be in denial that it will not eventually happen Clearly you are in an intimate relationship so go to Student Health and get on an effective contraceptive pill Depo etc and make that boyfriend of yours use a condomeven if you both have clothes on It is always safer to contain those babycausing sperm on one place If he cant keep them in his testicles then he should at least keep them in a condom No spicy food does not cause ovarian problems Your GI system is the likely source if there is a relationship Unfortunately humans cannot absorb water through the skin so it is back to the shaved ice again sucking on popsicles or just taking tiny sips through a juice box straw Hopefully his doctor gave him something for paina little Tylenol with codeine eliier will help him a great deal but you will need to get someone to call in a prescription for him If his throat hurts less he will be more likely to drink Signs of dehydration include a lack of tears a dry mouth and a reduction in his urine output A person with pancreatic cancer can really eat anything they want or at least anything that sounds good to them Loss of appetite is not uncommon with this terrible disease often made worse by pain medications or treatments some of which can cause severe constipation Nausea can be controlled by medication so if this is influencing food choices then it should be medically managed It is important to eat sufficient amounts to maintain strength but sometimes the idea of food is just repulsive Be very supportive Ask the person about their favorite foods and give it to them Anythingice cream smoothies lobster tailyou name it If the heart has a desire try and fullfill the wish Ringworm is just a skin fungus not a worm As long as the skin lesion is covered and under some topical antifungal medications it poses no risk to others or the food service Yes he can work Keep in mind that this skin lesion has been SELFDIAGNOSED so this recommendation assumes he is  There are several skin lesions that can mimic ringworm so it would be wise to get it properly examined and diagnosed It would not be possible to blindly diagnose your itchy pimples over the Internet You would need to be seen by a medical provider  someone who can take a thorough medical history and examine you They can use it if it seems to help but it is NOT going to cause them to loose weightor loose weight just in the belly The fact they are exercising and eating better is the KEY to weight loss not belly wraps It depends on the severity of your allergic reaction For instance someone who may be allergic to bees should not just get stung again to see what happens Someone who may be allergic to peanuts can have a fatal allergic reaction so it would not be wise to test with peanuts again There are excellent blood tests for food allergies One sample of blood can be tested for dozens and dozens of different food allergies from your list This is a safer way of making an accurate determination Food is calories Food does not cause you to burn calories Exercise and other activities burn calories Restricting your caloric intake of food will help you lose weight but it needs to be done carefully Think about getting some medical or nutritional help with your weight reduction goals Noif there were everyone would be eating them There has always been rumors about raw oysters one of my favorite foods I ate a dozen one time and only about four of them worked just kiddingan old joke People have claimed that ginseng and other herbs have the potential to enhance sexual performance but so far any studies have only been anecdotal and pure lies The biggest turn on to the opposite sex is not the food we eat but rather how we act and how well we treat them If there are aphrodisiac foods I havent heard of them Since your sister is the one treating you with her unfinished medication perhaps this question should be directed to her I am never of fan of this practice I think it is dangerous Since many illnesses are viral antibiotiics do absolutely nothing Apparently the medical provider at Urgent Care did not feel that you needed any antibiotic let alone a Sulfa drug or azithromycin The fact that a Zpack has worked for you in the past in no way implies that each year you have the same identical bacterial infection that responds to azithromycin Statistically this would be highly unlikely Illnesses do change over time Most people get better on their own but a few do get worse If you feel you are now sicker than when you were evaluated by Urgent Care than it would be better to be reevaluated again Perhaps you do need an antibiotic now but there is no way for me to make that determination over the Internet This would be the right thing to do Taking someone elses leftover antibiotic is not Foods do not cause or produce cold sores Cold sores also called herpes simplex are caused by the herpes virus It is possible for some foods to cause an irritant reaction that may reactivate herpes virus which tends to be come dormant between infections throughout your lifetime The transit time is quite variable in all peoplethere are no set times Food can remain in the stomach for two hours or so then progressively travel into the intestinal tract where it may process for several hoursor days In babies the transit time is surprisingly rapid Babies often poop while you are feeding them In some adults the transit time can be days especially in older people or people prone to constipation Transit time can be influenced by the type of food ingested the volumesize of meal the amount of waterfluids and the amount of fibersolids Spicy food may be faster than you anticipated A heavy Thanksgiving dinner may bloat you for a day or more A human being can go without food for a few weeks if they are not moving much but can only live for a few days without water If a person is in a semicoma that is so profound that they cant take nourishment then they need to be in a hospital Call the paramedics and let the billing sort itself out later Before you think of something like pancreatitis check simpler solutions like a bacterial infection Meanwhile keep hydrated and eat bland foods and get plenty of rest Dry crackers will help absorb fluid The unabsorbed food is probably being caused by your body rushing your food through your system too fast You could have lost it all in water weight If you continue feeling bad and continue losing weight see a doctor as soon as you can It could be the warning signs of a problem with your thyroid diabetes or a whole host of other things Yes depending on how much sodium and water you consume It may seem like your diet hasnt changed but we typically dont notice an increase in water or salt My weight can fluctuate between 3  7 lbs throughout the week by just water weight alone Stress is also a factor that can affect your bodys metabolism Absolutely Known this from experience You should get tested for Lyme Disease immediately There is not always a bullseye rash or visible tick You have nearly every symptom based on those experienced with having it Lyme Disease and other tick related coinfections are referred to as the great imitator because it brings on so many symptoms simultaneously that are consistent with so many other conditions They may want to test you for other things as well because of this especially as this has only been going on for a few days Personally I would specifically ask for an ELISA test and Western Blot to confirm  I am not a doctor just had lyme a few times If it is Lyme the sooner you are put on a protocol the better chance you have of not getting chronic Lyme Good Luck Hope you feel better soon I can see where you are coming from it does seem kind of early to tell However in this day and age  ya never know The way I understand home pregnancy tests they react to a hormone present in her urine When I was testing for pregnancy with my children the chemical reaction worked VERY QUICKLY The times I have tested and the results were negative it seemed to take forever It does not necessarily take a month to make those hormones strong enough to show as positive just as it does not take a month to become pregnant Since this relationship must have just started as you seem to be saying that you have never had sex before this with each other and cant possibly be responsible for this pregnancy unless it happened on one of these dates then you will have to trust your new found lover and wait it out with her She is probably terrified Be supportive There are now noninvasive tests so you can both be sure of paternity later She could probably use a good friend right now and youll get more answers by showing kindness during this complicated time rather than slinging around phrases like it aint mine Good Luck take your child to the doctor  these can be signs of a mild problem to a serious problem please remember if in doubt go to the doctor I think cats can cry Mine likes to whine when he cant go outside I think that only a vet can prescribe medication for any animal you really need to get the dog to a vet not eating or drinking will lead to dehydration and a slow death if not addressed the dog could be poisoned do NOT wait VET NOW You might check for Shingles I know you are only 18 but I know several young people that have had it In some cases you have the pain before you see any rash or blisters I was one of those which made it hard to diagnose Others have the rash or blisters then the pain Its something to check out Your pain is in the same area my was and it lasted for like a month not sure of evidence but you could surely be allergic even if you werent allergic before allergies can develop any time Food and drinks like coffee red wine and tea can discolor the teeth on the outside But those drinks arent for children Sodas are the worst possible drinks due to the high acid content Acid in the saliva allows cavities to form and grow on your teeth Unrestricted atwill sugar consumption has long been known to promote tooth decay which is the single most common chronic childhood disease  five times more common than asthma and seven times more common than hay fever A lack of certain nutrients can also make it more difficult for tissues in the mouth to resist infection The largest calcium depleters are sodas It sounds like what you have are canker sores The exact cause of canker sores in unknown They last 710 days and heal on their own There are several overthecounter medications that will cover and numb the sores so they dont hurt while youre eating It sounds like an ENT or gastroenterology issue Gastric reflux can be very damaging to the esophagus as well as the teeth Oral rinses may help but it sounds like a medical problem Start with your internist Wearing and functioning with dentures can be very difficult I would strongly recommend consulting with a dentist about adding a few implants to the equation Dental implants are an unbelievable innovation that stabilizes and anchors the dentures The problem could also be that your bite and the shape of the teeth just need to be altered slightly So see the dentist that fabricated your dentures Dentures can be very difficult to get used to They need to be removed and rinsed as much as possible Implants can solve a whole lot of problems I strongly suggest that you seek implant treatment Yes it is necessary to drink 8 glass water per dayIn todays life everyone is health concious and all want to become fit and away from diseasesWe can take other liquid also instead of water for health purpose and for energy levelwe can take fruits juicefruit tea and other drinks also Healthy foods help your skin become healthy also Skin is made up of proteins So lean proteins are necessary in your diet Examples include lean chicken fish and tofu if youre a vegetarian Fresh fruits like papaya and blueberries and fresh vegetables and whole grains also contribute to healthy skin Hydration also helps your skin fight off signs of age Have you been checked for migraines I left food in mud room for approx 8 hours and put in fridge when found it is not good to give to much food wet or dry becaquse of weight gain and vomiting from to full need more information I have experienced coffee ground emesis vomit It is what digested blood looks like as it has passed through the GI tract It often turns out to be an ulcer but it could also mean it could be a mass of some sort and should be dealt with immediately If you dont already have a Family Physician that can help expedite his endoscopy by calling their office and requesting that and if he is growing weak has lost weight then go to the ER again with a sample of his vomit if possible Be sure they draw his blood and check his complete blood count to look for infection and for hemoglobin He may also need a CT scan of his abdomen After 2 months they must show some pathology Insist that it is an emergency and that his endoscopy must be done STAT right now If you have to ask for the MD in charge If that doesnt work ask also for the Patient Representative It is true that the squeeky wheel does get the attention I think he has been more than patient and its time to get some answers Good luck You have al the signs of dehydration and hypovolemia from poor fluid intake which causes your blood pressure to go down especially when you first stand up Since you are keeping food down now then I would try to find foods with the highest protein content like eggs peanut butter beans also fruit such as blueberries strawberries bananaswhich have a high potassium content that you loose with vomitingdiarrhea I followed the advice of ParisJ13 The oil of oregano worked like magic I put a few drops in water and drank it and massaged it into my hands and went to sleep When I woke up the water blisters were almost completely gone Ill follow this routine until theyre gone Thank you for the advice  Well seems either its not important enough or no one knows I ended up doing a lot of research and actually got a lot of help from believe it or not the guys at GNC Theyre actually not only about selling but quite informative I was surprised So In general Flaxseed is not the way to go For treating any type of depression of any sort Fish Oil or Krill Oil is best There are three types of ways these oils work AHA DHA and EPA Flaxseed as a plant oil is AHA This type can turn into DHA and EPA but not always and is slow going If youve been told you need these oils for brain health you need the DHA found in both Fish andor Krill Oil And nowadays they make 5x purified capsules with no fish burps or horrendous taste I hate the smell OR taste of fish So if youve been told to get something like this for a person whos just about 100lbs Theyre good enough to take an adults version but might want to start off half the normal strength I was given a Triple Strength Fish Oil 1240 Hope it helps someone Its not medicine but after my daughters tried so many types to no avail its worth a shot And I like the idea of dietary supplement instead of drugs Id love to know this as well I have both a very low IgE as well as am PGE2 Deficient They dont play nicely together and the only way Ive been told there are infusionsIntravenous Immunoglobulin Therapy one can take to help but I guess that would depend upon how badly your body is in need of this I merely take a lot of Benadryl And sadly always have to have

specific diet is recommended for those diagnosed with HenochSchnlein purpura you can lessen gastrointestinal symptoms by adhering to a bland diet A bland diet can be as simple as refraining from eating any spicy foods to a more strict BRAT diet The BRAT diet consists of bananas rice applesauce and toast This combination is generally welltolerated by those with an upset stomach Liquids It is important to remain hydrated when suffering from HenochSchnlein purpura The condition normally clears up on its own over a period of weeks but during that time it is important to take in sufficient
