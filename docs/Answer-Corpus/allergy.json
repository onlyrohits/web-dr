{"text": "FULL BODY ALLERGY Cows milk While peanut allergy is the top lifelong food allergy a higher percentage of children are actually allergic to cows milk Yes In fact most children do outgrow food allergies  particularly if they are allergic to cows milk or soy products But people who have peanut or treenut allergies are the least likely to outgrow them  Your not being able to be treated with acetaminophen due to allergic reactions may be a blessing in disguise  Acetaminophen has been associated with causing ADHD behavior in children whose mothers were treated with this OTC medication Lets look at the alternatives to Acetaminophen Alternatives that should be avoided or taken with caution after discussing with your doctor  Many other OTC medications used to treat pain such as Ibuprofen and Naproxen should be used with caution avoided during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy and taken only after consulting with your physician Also aspirin is contraindicated for usage by all pregnant women Alternatives that may be considered to treat pain safely in pregnant women after physician approval The best options for treating pain in pregnant are natural remedy herbs such as follows A prescription drug that may be considered by your doctor as an alternative to acetaminophen is TramadolUltram  Natural treatments may include Muscle Massage Epson salts bathing and Chiropractor manipulation Migraine headaches can be extremely painful and deserve a through diagnostic workup to determine their cause Treatment of migraine headaches should be directed at specific causes such as stress and hormonal Identifying and removing migraine headache triggers is highly recommended Also determine if your doctor will suggest treatment options through phoneemail consulation without costing you the office visit expense Knee and hip replacements consisting of metalonmetal may cause a condition called Metallosis  This side effect happens when rubbing of the metal implanted surfaces results in chromium and cobalt particles accumulating in the blood stream to toxic levels some cobalt  chromium is normally found in the blood stream to carryout routine cellular actions The recommended treatment for Metallosis is a complete surgical revision removing the implant and installing a new implant of the knee or hip It is never a great idea to willynilly take any type of over the counter medication It is a doubly poor decision to take two 2 different over the counter medications at the same time whose chemical compositions are similar These convenient to obtain medications should be tailored to a persons symptoms age other medical conditions other medications being taken and preferably with a physicians approval These medications contain antihistamines that can cause sleepiness  fatigue dry mouth headache and other sideeffects An adult may take one 1 25 50 mg capsule of Benadryl every six 6 hours  Zertec may be taken at the recommended adult dosage of 510 mg 1 tablet daily  Combing or taking more than the recommended dosage of either drug may have deleterious medical consequences Lets look at the first part of your question Yes medications can remain in the system for hours and days after taking your final dose As a matter of fact I am still experiencing some residual allergic reactions from the medication Bactrim 3 days after taking the final dose The 2nd part of your posting questions whether Keflex caused allergy symptoms 5 days after you took the final dose The answer is most likely no and heres why Keflex an antibiotic is excreted by the kidneys and has a relatively short half life of less than an hour 09 hours The half life represents the time necessary for half of the drug to leave your system some people may experience a more delayed drug half life if they took Keflex with milk or have kidney disturbances After 1 or 2 days of having taken the last dose all of the Keflex should have left your system In order to eliminate products that may be adversely affecting your daughter she needs to continue with her current daily routine I recommend that you begin to keep a journal to document all of your daughters daily activities Note all meals  snacks  fluids ingested and all medications taken Reference the time and date of each activity Also note other activities of daily living including playtime computer time television time and bathing List the environmental location where the activity occurred car yard bedroom school etc Every single product used by your daughter also should be listed crayons soaps bubble bath detergents etc When your daughter has another allergic reaction the incident should be annotated completely as to time place duration and describe accurately the observed event After a short period of time you should look for obvious patterns associated with the allergic reaction You may want to take your daughter to see an allergist bring the journal with you to the appointment who can also do blood testing that will reveal the offending agent Your investment of time in documenting your daughters daily activities should be rewarded by providing you with the correct allergen responsible for the negative reaction You havent been on one medication long enough for it to get into your system to work Diphenhydramine the active ingredient in antihistamines like Benadryl would be a last resort due to the side effects that include a hangover feeling dry mouth constipation and dizziness Do you tune into your weather forecast to check the pollen counts If they are high you will continue to have your symptoms Stay on one product during the allergy season and if after a week or so you do not seem to be getting better see your doctor or health care provider you may need prescription medication This is an example of something you can talk to your pharmacist about Try ClaritinD which is located behind the pharmacy counter Im not sure if or when RespaAR will be back on the market Yes from my experience Of course the weather also in that city both together make a big difference I lived near Chicago for one year and the drier cold air in the winter almost killed me My asthma control was very poor and I almost died Then I moved to a warmer more humid area another state and my asthma has improved greatly Of course this area is less congested too the town I live in and the combination of both has made a difference I only have severe problems now when I take the bus a lot and I am around car exhaust fumes and smokers I hope this helps you some Good luck It could be seasonal allergy Rhinitis It occurs at the time of season changes and people easily get such symptoms So you need to treat it by having medicines like Allegra Such seasonal allergies are caused due to dust and pollen etc So to treat it you may opt for Allegra which is effective nonsedating antihistamine medicine that is intended to be used to treat for relieving allergy symptoms such as hay fever itchy eyes runny nose and others Allegra is easily available on online drug pharmacy Drugpillstore You have a wheat allergy google wheat and gluten allergies and this may help you understand you body better Sounds like you may have the beginning stage of a sty Stys are normally found under the eye lid or along the eye lash area When I get a sty I take a small amount of rice and put it into a baggie and place the open baggie with a wash cloth under the baggie into the microwave heat it for one minute Remove the baggie and wash cloth seal the baggie then fold the wash cloth around the baggie this will be hot if you wish wrap another wash cloth around the baggie and first wash cloth to avoid burning yourself Apply to your eye to help with the swelling and help the sty to come to a head so it can pop on its own Do not try and pop a sty as this could lead to infection and a longer period of time to heal Allow the sty to pop on its own always If need be see your doctor if the swelling gets worse or is still swollen for more than a week Boy do I hear you  because I have the same thing Some people simply have a chronically runny nose Usually the fluid is clear and thin This condition is called   This means your runny nose isnt related to any allergic cause If eating spicy or hot foods makes this problem worse the medical term for it is gustatory rhinitis or gustatory rhinorrhea Either way theres no cure Theres no cure for nonallergic rhinitis either If youve tried overthecounter pills and prescription nasal sprays without relief Im not sure what to suggest More hankies Sorry I cant be of more help but at least take comfort in knowing youre not alone About 20 million Americans suffer from nonallergic rhinitis Take care This is an interesting question and Im glad you asked it In order to develop an allergy to a substance you have to be exposed to it In other words its extremely rare to experience an allergic reaction to something on first exposure Its not impossible but its fairly rare One good example is penicillin Millions of people took penicillin as children and suffered no ill effects Many of those people today have penicillin allergies That early exposure caused their bodies to mount an extreme immune reaction to penicillin later on That could be what happened to you too If a physician confirmed your allergy you need to take it to heart Allergies not only can come on later in life they can get worse over time So that diarrhea from eating eggs today could turn into anaphylaxis eventually You also should be aware that people with a documented egg allergy may be discouraged from getting flu shots Id suggest you talk with your health care provider to see if this restriction applies to you Sorry youre going through this Its difficult to give up a wellloved food This is a great question and Im glad you asked Yes indeed you can develop allergies throughout your life In fact its rare to experience an to something on the first exposure This does happen especially with certain foods like peanuts and shellfish When this happens it usually occurs in infancy or childhood and produces a very strong allergic reaction An allergic reaction is basically the bodys overreaction to a perceived threat If youre exposed to a potential allergen food pollen medication etc the body may not react at all or may produce a mild immune response to that substance This may not produce symptoms After multiple exposures to the same allergen the body may overreact to it causing an allergic response This can range from mild rashes vomiting to severe swelling of the face or throat difficulty breathing A severe allergic reaction is called and requires immediate medical attention If you suspect you have developed an allergy to a substance Id suggest you consult your primary health care provider Also Id suggest you avoid whatever substance you believe is causing your allergic reaction What begins as a mild allergic response on one exposure can vault to anaphylaxis on another exposure Hope this helps Yes you definitely can still suffer from allergies after having your tonsils removed The are fleshy pads of tissue at the back of the throat They are part of the lymph system The lymph system helps the body fight infections by filtering and removing the bacteria and viruses that make us sick Unfortunately the tonsils do nothing for removing pollen  the usual source of  Seasonal allergies occur when an allergen stimulates an overresponse by the immune system This histamine reaction causes swollen tissue in the nose andor eyes itching runny nose and other unpleasant nasal allergy symptoms If you have no known drug allergies you can safely try an overthecounter allergy product Id suggest one of the nondrowsy types Wishing you well This is a very interesting and not uncommon occurrence believe it or not Of course its impossible to diagnose whats going on with your eye within a forum like this If the eye is very bloodshot youd do well to see a health care provider about it Usually these red streaks on the white part of the eye are no big deal but you dont want to take chances with your sight right The red streaks are caused by congested blood vessels in that area of your eye If it only happens in the right eye it makes me wonder if you tend to sleep on your right side Gravity could cause increased blood to build up in the vessels of your right eye for example Other things than can cause red streaks to the inner part of the white of the eye include rubbing coughing sneezing and high blood pressure And that last cause is just one good reason to get checked by a health care provider Best wishes to you Sorry to hear about this rash How annoying Rashes are difficult to diagnose without a physical examination Its certainly possible that too much sun exposure caused your rash but it seems odd it would only be on one side of the face If your rash becomes painful and turns to blisters and if youve ever had chickenpox then you should be alert to the possibility this could be  Shingles is a bit unusual in someone your age but its not unheard of Shingles can be contagious so if you develop the above symptoms Id advise calling your primary care provider and letting him or her know about your rash so he or she can determine if you should come into the office Also if you develop those symptoms stay away from anyone who has not had chickenpox in order to avoid giving them the virus Chances are your rash is not serious and will clear up on its own If it gets worse or doesnt clear up within a few days Id suggest you visit your health care provider Good luck to you Im sorry to hear this elderly lady is going through this The symptom you describe is worth at least a call to the patients primary care physician If she develops sudden difficulty breathing or swelling of the lips or tongue you need to call 911 for immediate medical attention If the situation has been going on for some time this lady needs to be seen by a health care provider A number of conditions can cause swollen eyelids and its important for her to be examined in order to get a correct diagnosis If the problem came on suddenly I would suspect an allergic reaction This could be caused by a new medication a new soap an animal in the house bedbugs or many other things If the situation doesnt clear up quickly then a visit to the doctor is in order Again If this lovely elder lady develops any lifethreatening symptoms please seek emergency medical attention immediately Wishing you all the best Im sorry to hear youre going through this My concern is that you dont have at all Normally shingles isnt described as hives all over the body that itch In fact if you have welts on both sides of your body as divided by the spinal column then I can guarantee you do not have shingles Shingles only affects  Even though you dont currently have health insurance Id suggest you find a way to get checked out by a medical professional preferably when youre having an outbreak of these hives Most communities have free or lowcost medical clinics to serve people who have no insurance You can locate one of these clinics near you by calling your local Medicaid office or by performing an internet search for free health clinic and your city name I wish you all the best at finding a solution to this annoying condition Im sorry to hear this Its hard when we feel food choices are being taken away from us Im glad to see you can differentiate between an intolerance having an undesirable reaction to a true allergy hives anaphylaxis etc Big difference I wish I could tell you why these food intolerances seem to be coming on all at once Its certainly worth getting the situation checked out by a doctor I can tell you that it takes exposure to develop an intolerance or allergy so perhaps your body just reached its exposure threshold with certain items and is now reacting badly to them Here is some general information on that might be helpful You might start with your primary care provider to see if he or she can provide any insight I wish you all the best The passage way from your nostrils is connected with your throat This is why when you laugh and drink milk at the same time it comes out of your nose When you force air pressure through your nose to blow the mucus out it also can come out of your mouth It is my experience that most people do well after stopping the allergy shots The typical treatment course is 35 years but is tailored based on each persons case In some instances patients remain on the vaccine longer At some point it is worth repeat skin testing as peoples allergic sensitivities change over time and with immunotherapy Allergy drops are more commonly used in Europe than in the United States The allergy drop method is currently being investigated particularly for those allergic to many different pollens polysensitization In my opinion the allergy drop method is still investigational but may offer an exciting new approach to allergy vaccine once more is learned on how to maximize efficacy I currently recommend the injection form of allergen immunotherapy but am following the results of ongoing research into other modalities Typically the recommendation for dust mite and pet allergy is decreasing exposure For dust mites this would include washing the sheets in hot water once per week keeping his bedroom vacuumed and implementing dust mite encasements for the pillow boxspring and mattress In regard to pet allergy whether to get rid of the animals is a personalfamily decision At the least keeping the animals out of the bedroom can decrease exposure His allergist can make more specific recommendations in the context of the severity of your sons symptoms and test results That medication should not affect the test results I recommend calling the doctors office if anyone has questions about what to stop for allergy testing Stopping important medications for other conditions may pose greater problems so it is best to ask Typical childhood vaccines do not have peanut allergen in them I am cautious with the flu vaccine for those that are egg allergic but most of the time the vaccine can still be given in that case as well Everyones response to the allergy vaccine is somewhat different as I have seen many patients be able to stop medications while others still need their medications but have much better control of their symptoms I usually tell patients if their symptoms are doing well to stop or reduce their allergy medications one at a time and if symptoms return to add it back That way the least amount of medications to control symptoms are taken Many patients can at least reduce allergy medication use following vaccine Shellfish allergy typically does not go away There is extensive cross reactivity between all shellfish An allergist can help sort this out and can provide dietary recommendations If you are still shrimp allergic I would recommend that you have an epi pen in case of accidental ingestion I do not know of a mechanism by which allergic reactions would lead to hearing loss I do not know of a way to explain those symptoms in the context of your allergies I would mention them to your primary care doctor so an investigation into other possible causes can be undertaken Allergic disease in general tends to run in families If you are concerned about possible food allergy complete a food journal writing down all your symptoms and relationship to timing of specific foods Allergy testing can be performed to evaluate for food allergy Certain food allergies like nuts and seafood are less likely to be outgrown but most others resolve over time Food allergy causes a specific type of reaction such as immediate within minutes to a few hours hives liptongue swelling flushing itching lightheadedness nausea vomiting or low blood pressure every time the offending food is consumed Pustules acnelike lesions are usually nonallergic For people with allergic asthma allergy shots immunotherapy can be effective at reducing allergic triggers to asthma An allergist would evaluate to determine if heshe thinks you would benefit from allergy shots Asthma should be controlled as best as possible with medications before starting allergy shots Because you are being injected with things you are allergic to there is a risk of having an allergic reaction Most patients do not have any side effects and those that experience side effects typically have localized itching and swelling at the injection side In very rare cases people experience severe allergic reactions or anaphylaxis Most cases of anaphylaxis happen shortly after the allergy shots are given that is why you are required to be monitored in the clinic for a period of time The allergy office is prepared with the needed medications to treat patients with severe reactions The risk of a fatal reaction is extremely small but there have been a few cases of patients having fatal reactions Because of this it will be important that you understand the protocol and instructions for the allergy shots There are many safety procedures in place to prevent serious reactions If you have any questions about the protocol or risk you should thoroughly discuss with your allergist before starting Cats and dogs are common cohabitants in the home Most people tolerate exposure to these pets without symptoms but some develop allergies to them Cat and dog allergies are triggered by an immune response to proteins in the animals saliva urine and skin All cats and dogs have these allergens The best treatment is complete avoidance When this is not possible the next best thing is to keep the pet out of the bedroom to decrease exposure to the allergen Nonallergic or irritant triggers such as smoke strong odors and perfumes can cause nasal symptoms such as sneezing congestion and runny nose Sinus rinses and nasal steroid sprays can be helpful to decrease your sensitivity Prescription Atrovent nasal spray can also be helpful Allergic reactions to mold typically cause symptoms such as sneezing itchywatery eyes runny nose nasal congestion or respiratory problems This is because allergies trigger specific allergic cells to release chemicals that cause these symptoms There is not a well understood mechanism by which mold allergy could contribute to neurocognitive symptoms Because of this I often recommend that patients pursue other investigation beside allergy so they dont miss another cause of these symptoms If you are concerned that mold is causing symptoms you could always try techniques to decrease the mold level in your basement such as dehumidifier Certain food allergies like nuts and seafood are less likely to be outgrown but most others resolve over time Food allergy causes a specific type of reaction such as immediate within minutes to a few hours hives liptongue swelling flushing itching lightheadedness nausea vomiting or low blood pressure every time the offending food is consumed Pustules acnelike lesions are usually nonallergic Summers are frequently a busy time with many children off on school and summer trips For parents with food allergic children it is easy to forget the epi pen when packing for trips Also when food allergic kids are out of their routine it is also easier to accidently ingest a food they typically avoid Many parents find it helpful to put together an extra small bagpouch with benadryl epi pens and important phone numbers to carry on vacation Allergies and sinusitis can sometimes cause swollen lymph nodes in the neck but these usually go away fairly quickly If you have noticed persistent swollen lymph nodes under the arm it would be best to have them examined by your doctor Sinus rinses can be very helpful for post nasal drip You can also consider over the counter antihistamines If these are not enough you should see your doctor about other treatments including antiinflammatory nasal sprays I would like to know the same thing I have tried to use the Montelukast 2 times now and both times I ended up with a sinus infection With the second one I ended up in the emergency room with severe pain on the right side of my head I am not even a headache person So much for saving money It is back to Singulair for me When it comes to medication products it is important to read all product labels carefully before purchasing and consuming any item Consult the local pharmacist to help make sure no shellfish materials are found in the product Remember also that ingredients change from time to time So check labels every time you shop Fish oil products usually come from oily fish such as salmon trout swordfish and mackerel Particular products that are EPA and DHA derived come from the omega3 sources tend to be more bioavailable making the product more effective to provide the cardiovascular effects desired Shellfish are typically not used to make the fish oil products However it is important to read all ingredients on the bottle Call the manufacturer to make sure there are no shellfish ingredients Once you find a particular brand that works for you stick with it But continue to check the label to make sure nothing has changed with the product Lodine is the brand name for etodolac a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medication This medication does not give allergy relief and I would find out more about why she is taking this medication Antihistamine medications that are NOT combined with other medications are safe to take with blood pressure medications and should not affect your blood pressure We tend to be more concerned about nasal decongestants affecting blood pressure more than the antihistamines when treating allergy symptoms I suggest working with your local pharmacist to help select a product for the specific symptoms you are trying to treat that would not affect your blood pressure Yes Allegra is the same as fexofenadine Every medication has two names a brand and a generic name The original creators are the only ones who can use the brand name Once the recipe becomes available to other drug manufacturers they sell the product under the generic name It usually takes approximately seven years for the brand to go generic The main active ingredient has to remain the same in each recipe What differs from the brand and generic are the inactive ingredients that can hold the medication together and that give it its color In addition the generic can be much more affordable Most generics are FDA approved to be equally effective Therefore if the generic works for you then there is no need to switch Also make sure to only take one and not both the brand and generic to prevent overdosing and additive side effects If you have a true allergy to sulfa medications then Lasix may not be for you It does contain sulfa product If you have difficulty breathing or your airways feel like they are closing off or a rash has developed specifically on the trunk of the body then you should stop taking this medication immediately and consult with your pharmacist and health care provider It is important to differentiate between allergies to medications and side effects If you have experienced intolerable side effects to medications containing sulfa products that doesnt mean you are allergic Work with you local pharmacist and physician to reevaluate this situation and to make sure you are taking medication that is appropriate for you I am also 54 and female I cannot tolerate yeast eggs wheat rice and marjoram coming on also in the last year in addition to existing intolerance to dairy and soy Those two came on when I was 40 and 41 I always blamed the giardia infection I had when I was 30 After scopes and xrays my gastroenterologist says that my GI system is healthy If this helps  you are not alone I am 23 years old by the way non smoker Otherwise healthy The baby may have a cold an ear infection reflux formula intolerance or possibly another condition Its best to have her checked by the pediatrician to see what can be done to help her  Young babies in day care or preschool can get colds around 3 to 10 times per year with each cold lasting up to 2 or 3 weeks which may feel like all the time They can certainly start getting sick even at a month or two of age Virus infections may also happen when a baby is teething Its unusual however for babies to have allergies before 9 months of age and some experts feel kids dont have seasonal allergies until closer to 2 or 3 years old  If your baby doesnt have a fever and seems to be fine except for the noisy breathing its probably nothing to worry about But if the stuffy nose interferes with sleep or feeding or if he seems to be in pain be sure to have your doctor check him out Thanks for checking in You should definitely be concerned because if your husband sucks up mucus from his nostrils and the mucus gets into the lungs then it can cause some serious health problems For one thing the mucus line builds up narrowing the air paths that the lungs need to take in air and take out carbon dioxide And when that happens it becomes hard or even impossible to breathe Nasal spray does help but it also helps to blow your nose So good luck Well they actually would all probably help but theres a few other things that we need to know here Does the patient want to have something thats gonna cause em drowsiness or something thats not gonna make them tire The other question I have is are they actually living with the pet You know its one of those things that they might go over to a house once in a while occasionally where there are pets there that they have this allergic reaction to and in that case theres different choices based on that medication For something quick Zyrtec or  overthecounter is a great choice It will cause a little bit of tiredness but it does work usually within 30 minutes Claritin is a nondrowsy one but sometimes you have to take it for a few days before itll make you feel better But once again we just need a little bit more information But if the patient can go to their pharmacist and ask them and tell them Yes I live with the cat yearround and things like that we can help them in the right direction as far as what product over the counter may be a good choice or refer them to the proper healthcare professional I would definitely talk to the pediatrician or healthcare provider to find out whether or not they could use something like Claritin They have a liquid form and the doctor may say Hey you know what You can try that instead It may not work as fast as the Benadryl but it would be another option for them to try I always typically refer my pregnant moms to make sure that they talk to their healthcare provider first because they might have a particular brand that they are comfortable with I always typically refer my pregnant moms to make sure that they talk to their healthcare provider first because they might have a particular brand that they are comfortable with There is another product out on the market called ChlorTrimeton and thats an older medication very similar to Benadryl that is still available and that has great data with it because it was actually tested in pregnancy and that is considered very safe and effective Zyrtec and Claritin are other alternatives that could be used but once again I do stress though the fact that they should really call their healthcare provider first and see what they prefer as far as the drug to treat with Now if they have a stuffy nose its a little different subject because nasal decongestants arent as safe in pregnant women and typically they have to use a saline nasal spray which I know is difficult because it may not relieve the congestion as much but its really the safest thing for them to use Thats another great question And once again we want to make sure that the patients are using one pharmacy or have a medication list ready when they ask this question because we dont know sometimes all the medications that patients are taking And everyone thinks Well you know this medications overthecounter so I should be able to take it and its not gonna react with anything Unfortunately thats not the case Were finding out more and more that as people use them more frequently and are starting to take herbals and vitamins and prescription meds all together that there are so many interactions Believe it or not there actually are some foods that can counteract with medicines today One of the things that I notice even with Allegra is the fact that fruit juices can actually not make the drug work as well  and its not just grapefruit juice Things like orange juice and apple juice just the level of acidity actually doesnt make the drug work as well so therefore Ive recommended patients to not take it with juice or not have juice within an hour of taking the medication Also another popular thing that people do is that they tend to take things like Maalox or Milk of Magnesia if they have an upset stomach and take their pills you know with it or within 20 minutes of it Always good to space it with medicines because these products can actually bind and make it like a cement brick and therefore the pill cant do its job as well because its stuck in this little nasty situation So I always tell people space antacids and things like that by at least two hours Therefore its out of your system and the medication can dissolve and do its job But thats a really common question that we get with pharmacists If you have any questions about specific food products always feel free to ask us We can look it up if were not sure but there is some really good data out there that shows us what medications and what foods might interact If it says Do not drink alcohol which some people may consider a food that is something that I tell people to not do either Alcohol is just a product that believe it or not just makes side effects worse It will make you more tired especially with allergy medications It could cause your stomach to become more upset A lot of people dont realize all the things that it could do for you so basically while youre on allergy medications or really for that matter any medication you should really limit your alcohol use or dont drink at all Usually some of the terms and the guidance that I see is that before allergy season some physicians or healthcare providers will start you on Singulair maybe a month or two before allergy season hits so its in your bloodstream so it has a constant and steady effect so therefore by the time allergy season comes its working And how does it work Well typically when you have allergy season your cells are all happy and theyre all behaving In an allergy attack they all go crazy What Singulair tries to do is it tries to keep them all happy and behaving before it even gets to that point of kind of revolting in a lot of ways So that makes a lot of sense when I explain that to patients because then they realize that they have to take it every day and that its not something that they take at the onset of a sneezing attack or runny eyes or a runny nose So it could take probably up to 30 days before theyll notice something I  but once again what weve learned too is that therapy has to be individualized and how I take something and how you take something might be completely different A lot of people dont realize how important it is to take your medicine on a consistent basis Thats where you really get the value and actually the benefits of the medicine because if its only once a day you know its not a big deal but I say to patients Im like You know if you skipped five or six days thats gonna effect how you feel And a lot of people dont put two and two together So I want to make sure that people understand that there are benefits to taking your medicine every single day Great question and something that you should always ask your pharmacist because you need to be careful with overthecounter medications even while you are nursing Allergy medications like Claritin Benadryl and Zyrtec have all been found in breast milk Because of the higher risk of adverse reactions in infants generally and for newborns and premature infants in particular antihistamine therapy is not recommended in nursing mothers Medicare Part B generally covers diagnostic tests and outpatient care which should include allergy testing and treatment I would not recommend she take Sudafed PE with Adderall These two medications can be too stimulating in combination Sudafed PE is for congestion It does not treat allergies For allergies she would be better off using an antihistamine which will treat her allergies without causing drowsiness and is safe to take with Adderall You should always talk to your pharmacist before taking any overthecounter medication so they can help you choose the best one for your symptoms Yes There are no dangerous drug interactions between antihistamines for allergies and expectorants for a cough You should always speak with your pharmacist before choosing an overthecounter cold medication They can help you find the best one for your specific symptoms Before making any recommendations I would really need some additional information about your daughter and the medications she is using It is unlikely that a medication for impetigo or an eye drop medicine would interfere with any overthecounter fever reducers So it is likely to be fine I would suggest you ask your pharmacist to recommend a medication to reduce your daughters fever based on her age weight and the other medications shes taking Both of those products contain antihistamines which treat allergy symptoms Claritin Liquid Gels should last for 24 hours So if you are finding you need more medication at night they may not be working for you I would need to know more about your symptoms and how you are feeling in order to suggest the best way to treat them I suggest you discuss the issue with your healthcare professional First steroid nasal sprays if used properly will not weaken your sons immune system They are very safe and effective medications for treating allergy symptoms Many steroid nasal sprays are indicated for children as young as two years old So I am not sure which nasal spray was prescribed for your son or where the information you are reading came from I would suggest you check with your pharmacist if you are concerned I would not recommend using products that contain phenylephrine which is found in Sudafed PE if you have high blood pressure It can raise your heart rate and blood pressure You should talk to your pharmacist who can help you find a safer medication to use to treat your allergy symptoms  one that will not interact with your blood pressure medications You should not use Sudafed if you are taking AllegraD They both contain decongestants and you will likely experience more severe side effects from combining the two Side effects common with decongestants include rapid heartbeat jitters insomnia loss of appetite and increased blood pressure Sudafed is safe to take with Rhinocort and allergy eye drops But if you are still congested while taking AllegraD I would suggest you talk to your doctor to figure out how best to manage your allergies and congestion It is safe to take DayQuil with loratadine NyQuil contains an antihistamine and loratadine is an antihistamine So taking those two together would expose you to two antihistamines in one day which is not generally recommended Overthecounter antihistamines are safe to take if you use Lexapro But I suggest you use one that does not cause drowsiness Antihistamines can cause drowsiness which can be more pronounced in someone taking a medication like Lexapro Always ask your pharmacist before using an overthecounter medication to ensure it is safe for you There are several options available over the counter to treat allergy symptoms for a 10yearold Loratadine and cetirizine are the two newest OTC antihistamines available The advantage to these medications is that they work for a full 24 hours and you only need to take them once a day Cetirizine found in Zyrtec tends to cause a bit more drowsiness than loratadine which is found in Claritin You should talk to your daughters pediatrician if she is having severe allergies to ensure an overthecounter antihistamine is appropriate for her at this time  First off whey typically contains low levels of casein but it is obviously present in the milk Children can outgrow food allergies so you want to see a boardcertified pediatric allergist on a regular basis and keep himher updated on changes in your child You also want to make sure food allergy diagnosis utilize a combination of tests skin prick blood test food elimination etc so you get an accurate reading The best thing to do is to visit a pediatric allergist to see if your child is still allergic to casein He or she can help you decide whether or not to start introducing products that your child has previously had reactions to Good luck Allergies are the result of an overactive immune system In response to a substance like pollen or pet dander the bodys natural defenses become overactivated to fight the invader Inflammatory reactions to allergens commonly occur in areas including the eyes nose and throat An influx of white blood cells and local release of irritating chemicals are the bodys response during an allergic reaction Swelling in the lymph nodes in the area of the neck jaw and throat can sometimes occur However swollen lymph glands can also be caused by viral and bacterial

restricts urine flow and can lead to the complete closure of the bladder opening and cause acute urinary retention For this reason these cold and allergy medications are labled with warnings against their use if a person has benign prostatic hyperplasia BPH  enlarged prostate While shortterm use of these medicines is unlikely to be a significant problem chronic use should be avoided

hope you find some help Good Luck Yes it is possible to outgrow food allergies although thats not always the case You should slowly try to introduce this back into your diet in VERY small amounts If you dont seem to have any problems then you shouldnt have anything to worry about If you want to be sure then you can see your doctor again to have another round of allergy tests Have you tried taking benadryl that works for me Dont know why he would make such a thing up So with that in mind I would suggest making him turkey bacon in place of pork bacon that should do the trick your allergies maybe got something to do w it mainly because it has a triggering factor before you experience it as you said especially when taking dairy products what you experience is that when you take certain food or anything that triggers your allergic reaction is that your throat lining starts to swell thus decreasing your airway and making you feel that somethings blocking your throat to verify if its allergic response that causes that feeling whenever you experience it try taking any antihistamines but make sure to take nondrowse or take it when you are not working because it will make you feel drowsy those are typical allergic reaction especially she has identified those that triggers it those laboratory findings got nothing to do w allergies HPylori are microorganism usually found in stomach and they are the one causes gastritis and stomach ulcers blood type probably got nothing to do w allergies but sometimes allergies runs in the family rheumatoid factor is a test done for people who are suspected of rheumatism and arthritis thought RF is also an immune response just like allergic response but they got different roles those are typical allergic reaction especially she has identified those that triggers it those laboratory findings got nothing to do w allergies HPylori are microorganism usually found in stomach and they are the one causes gastritis and stomach ulcers blood type probably got nothing to do w allergies but sometimes allergies runs in the family rheumatoid factor is a test done for people who are suspected of rheumatism and arthritis thought RF is also an immune response just like allergic response but they got different roles I had a similar problem Gingivitis was partly the cause and my jaw bone has been getting thinner for several years so a dental surgeon was consulted and he took care of my problem Without a fever its possible but you really should be evaluated by your doctor Three months is a long time to be going through this Even when youre sick with a virus or bacterial infection you dont always get a fever  one of the obvious signs youre ill Hope you feel better Zyrtec lasts 24 hours so usually Benadryl is not needed It is safe to give it at night even if he is on Zyrtec but this firstgeneration antihistamine can interfer with restful dreamstate sleeping Finding the cause or causes of hives is VERY clinically difficult There are no tests that would conclusively determine the specific cause You can due hundreds of tests and perhaps get a few things that show up positive but that does not prove this is the specific cause There are no tests for rare causes unfortunately Of course you and her mother are frustated Who wouldnt be Frustration does not make it any easier in finding a cause so the next best thing to do is just treat her for hives with something that worksand something that she can take every day Me too To make matters worse I have 12 chickens and lots of eggs that I have to give away Like you eggs in other products are just fine but plain eggs are not Many people develop food intolerances It may not be an allergy but it could be so ask your medical provider to order an EGG IGG allergy test It is not in your head That would not be likely Yeast likes warm dark moist places like the vagina or inside a diaper The eyes and nose really doesnt have a welcoming environment that would be favorable to yeast You are safe You would need to ask your doctorI have no way of knowing hisher rationale but perhaps it was because he heard lung sounds that may be consistent with mild asthma or reactive airway disease  a more severe form of allergies If your medical provider has prescribed penicillin for a bacterial infection then yes If YOU are selfprescribing penicillin for your cold then be advised that colds are viruses and penicillin does not work for viruses When you have high blood pressure certain cold medications should not be taken so please consult your medical provider or pharmacist for advise  someone who knows the exact medications you are taking or plan on taking I do not have this information nor do I know your medical history An allergy to your own urine is not possible Your labial itching may eventually help you overcome your fear of being examined since this may be the ONLY way you can have this problem properly diagnosed This is NOT something that can be done blindly over the Internet based solely on a vague description Having a sympathetic female physician PA or nurse practitioner should ease your discomfort and fear especially if you disclose it prior to your visit Have a trusted friend go with you Your doctor can even provide you with a shortacting antianxiety medication to help you overcome your fear In most cases a yeast infection is the underlying cause but since the labia is covered in skin and skin can have HUNDREDS of dermatological conditions that cause itching it would likely be futile to try and treat a condition that is not even diagnosed Yes they can be taken together There are much better medications for allergies than Benadryl which only lasts 4 hours Why not try genertic Claritin Zyrtec or Allegra They can last a whole day Decongestants can be used with antihistamines or separatelyas long as the dosgages are appropriate Newer recommendations do not support the use of these types of drugs for children under the age of six unless specifically prescribed and approved by the childs medical provider Decongestants have not proven to be very effective in the management of colds and do not help children with allergies Antihistamines can be helpful for allergies however but again it is best to get the okay from your childs pediatrician because of the age Excessive calorie intake and lack of calorieburning are the main causes of weight gain Allergies per se does not cause weight gain but changes in food quality switching from a food that is suspected of causing allergy to one of higher calories and amounts of food can be a subtle cause if the person is not aware they are actually eating MORE calories Failure to thrive in infants is a lack of weight gain and would not be comparable Oryou are Jewish An allergy solely to pork would be uncommon but basically a human can have allergies or food intolerances not an allergic response to just about anything If you know your reaction the best course of action is to simply avoid pork Some people not all who are allergic to penicillins are also allergic to cephalosporins Some studies show that it is safe for penicillinallergic people to take this class of antibiotics but there is a still a longstanding warning against it Since I do not know anything about you or your allergic history it is always best to address this question directly with your medical provider  someone who knows your medical history Benadryl diphenhydramine lasts about four hours so you can use certirizine anytime after four hours An EpiPen can be used for an anaphylactic allergic reaction caused by anything  If the person is having difficulty breathing generalized hives etc that EpiPen is needed so you will have time to get to the emergency room If the person just has an mild penicillin rash or mild hives epinephrine is not the preferred treatment Certainly a peanut sensitivity allergy food intolerance may exist IL would think it wise to have an allergist test your child for a peanut allergy just to be safe In the meantime avoidance of peanut products would be prudent No the color of mucous does not automatically assume that something is viral bacterial or allergicit is just a clue In most cases green mucous is more likely to indicate stagnation especially if the green is primarily in the mornings Just a like a pond that turns green when water is not flowing in and out the mucous can be green when you are chronically congested You will need to be medically evaluated in order to determine if the green really has a bacterial association or is just plain ol stagnation Colds are caused by viruses The only biological explanation in your case would be that your allergies are overwhelming your immune system making you more vulnerable to getting a viral infection Allergies cause congestion and inflammation and respiratory viruses tend to be opportunisitichitting you when you are down so to speak There are no direct relationship between colds and allergies otherwise but a person can certainly have both at the same time No Hard shelled capsules that you swallow are not made of latex Medicinal capsules are designed to quickly melt and be absorbed She is allergic to something most likely You and her allergist haventfound it quite yet and may never find it Some hives are caused by changes in temperature like getting too warm It is not necessary to know the cause of the hives in order to treat it successfully with antihistamines I know hives can be frustrating but it can be very very difficulteven impossible to find the one or many causes If a person is dogallergic and spends a considerable amount of time in a home with dogs it is likely that he will have an increase in his allergic responses I know you do not want to get rid of your dogs so antihistamines like Claritin or Zyrtec can block an allergic response and of course there are other prescription allergy treatments that his medical provider can prescribe The child can get desensitization allergy shots therapy for dog dander but that takes time and doesnt always work The dogs should not sleep on his bed or even be in the room where he sleeps You should not be able to get Strep while on amoxicillin since this drug is used for Strep You can however get a VIRAL sore throat or even mono while taking antibiotics It is normal to have some morning accumulation of fluid or mucouslike substance in the corners of the eye Thinner drainage like tears will drain down the nasolacrimal duct into your nose and not be noticed The thicker material just can make it through this tiny drainage tube The eye is always secreting tears and lubrication from oillike glands under the eyelid so this is not really alarming True pink eye conjunctivitis is typically painful and the drainage is copious all day long Allergic conjunctivitis tends to itch and last a long long time Making a selfdiagnosis can be difficult so if you are concerned then you can address this problem with your medical provider or even optometrist Obviously without the ability to see these blisters firsthand I cannot offer you a patientspecific answer but many people who see blisterlike growths on the pharynx throat are really seeing ectopic lymph tissue often referred to as cobblestones in the medical world this area is rich in lymph tissue Cobblestoning can be found in a variety of medical conditions  basically anything that causes inflammation Allergies even if no allergies were identified and recurrent viral infections irriation from postnasal drainage etc all can cause these cobblestonelike effects Unless a bacterial infections is diagnosed by a culture or rapid Strep test antibiotics especially massive antibitoics tend to have no curative effects Blisters filled with pus would not be common for cobblestones If she also gets bronchitis at the same time it may not be related to this throat finding at all Most cases of bronchitis are viral Although a specific reason has not be determined by her medical providers it would be wise to keep looking This would be highly unlikely It is the ingestion of shellfish in an allergic person that is the real culprit Just having shellfish present in the room should not be an issue I do not think that your attack by killer bees triggered your allergy and sinus problems A long term effect of a bee attack for me would be death assuming I did not have my Epi Pen handy but unless the bees resulted in permanent neurological damage  something that you would have experienced soon after the attack  then I dont feel there would be any longterm effects other than killerbee phobia There are literally hundreds of causes of vertigo If your allergies are affecting your ear namely your middle or inner ear then it could cause temporary vertigo That may be difficult to prove however in light of the many other causes that may need to be considered I dont knowI didnt see it you did There are many possibilities but consider a TONSILLITH a tonsil stone that has dislodged You can find information about cryptic tonsils and tonsillitis on WebMD ENT board or by a WebMD or Google search Your allergy medications will not influence a pregnancy test but a pregnancy test taken very early could definitely be a false negative You can repeat the test weekly for a while or have your gynecologist order a moresensitive blood pregnancy test A bright yellow nasal discharge does not automatically mean sinusitis or even indicate a bacterial infection Mucous can become yellow for a variety of reasons including simple stagnation Most sinus infections like colds are viral and do not require antibiotics The fact that you do not have a fever or other sinus related symptoms would seem to indicate that you may not have a sinusitis You can definitely wait it out a bit longer Viral infections tend to last about a week worse in the first 34 days Do all of the supportive measures drink plenty of water humidify your environment use saline nasal spray as well as the Pantanse and keep that stuffy nose following Should your symptoms persist or worsen it would be wise to seek medical care so that you can be properly examined and treated The D part stands for a decongestant like Sudafed Allegra itself is an antihistamine It would be best to have your babys pediatrician properly prescribe for her due to her very young age The list of allergy medicines that can be used is often just lowdose Benadryl Allergies and colds can mimic each other in their array of symptoms at this age No she is wrong Allergies are NOT contagious Yes It should not be a problem There are not egg or nut substances in this vaccine The D in Allegra D is a decongestant that cause drainage especially if you take it near bedtime The antihistamine component in Allegra is fine at bedtime so you may want to consider losing the D at bedtime A Zpack azithromycin is compatible with this medication A DtaP Adacel can be taken if you have a mold allergy but always check with your allergist first if you have an unusual response The vaccine is not moldbased When it comes to severe lifethreatening anaphylactic reactions just about any allergen could trigger a fatal response in some highlyallergic people Peanuts do it Beestings do it I guess it is possible that cat dander could do it too but I have never heard of a case Have your doctor or allergies order a blood test for cat dander RAST test and see how high the reaction might be An allergic reaction is often sudden HIVES that are very pruritic itchy An amoxicillin side effect usually occurs near the end of the course of treatment day 810 not day three and is bright red occuring all over the body This does not usually itch Soit could be either one I dont have enough specific information and the ability to examine your baby to offer you a definitive answer Latex is a labcreated synthetic product Aloe vera is a natural plant and plant extract that does not contain any synthetic substances like latex I have never heard that allergy shots would have any adverse sexual sideeffects As a matter of fact I do not think it would be medically possible for this to ever happen See your OBGYN for a consultation If there is a discoverable cause for your inorgasmia it will not be your allergy shots ClaritinZyrtecand Allegra are longacting nonsedating antihistamines They are all compatible with Singulair It would not be possible to blindly diagnose your itchy pimples over the Internet You would need to be seen by a medical provider  someone who can take a thorough medical history and examine you It depends on the severity of your allergic reaction For instance someone who may be allergic to bees should not just get stung again to see what happens Someone who may be allergic to peanuts can have a fatal allergic reaction so it would not be wise to test with peanuts again There are excellent blood tests for food allergies One sample of blood can be tested for dozens and dozens of different food allergies from your list This is a safer way of making an accurate determination I have never heard that before and medically it does not make scientific sense My answer would be NO They are both the same or at least chemically equivalent Singulair is the brand name  montelukast is the generic name  They can be used interchangeably in treating allergies A child can have a mild fever with inflammation and allergies can certainly cause inflammation It would be highly unlikely for an adult with a mature immune system to get a fever solely from allergies There is usually another cause Sun allergy or photosensitivity should incorporate the following precautions Before you go outdoors apply a sunscreen that has a sun protection factor SPF of at least 30 with a broad spectrum of protection against both ultraviolet A and ultraviolet B rays Use a sunblock on your lips Choose a product that has been formulated especially for the lips with an SPF of 20 or more Limit your time outdoors when the sun is at its peak In most parts of the United States the sun is at its peak from about 10 am to 2 pm Wear sunglasses with ultraviolet light protection Wear long pants a shirt with long sleeves and a hat with a wide brim Be aware of skincare products and medicines that may trigger a photo allergenic eruption These include certain antibiotics and oral birth control pills as well as prescription medicines that are used to treat psychiatric illness high blood pressure or heart failure If you are taking a prescription medication and you normally spend a great deal of time outdoors ask your doctor whether you should take any special precautions to avoid sun exposure while you are on the drug if your allergies are making you develop fluid in your lungs then there is a possibility of pneumonia because pneumonia is when the fluid in your lungs gets infected also yes allergies defiantly influence asthma I was on Singulair for about 15 years without any effects to my liver My normal yearly physical exams include blood work and my liver numbers were always in the normal range In the summer of 2012 my insurance decided to change my Singulair prescription to Montelukast because its cheaper how nice of them Everyone said its the same exact thing as Singulair but for some reason I was apprehensive and just didnt trust this new medicine In February 2013 I had my yearly physical and my liver numbers had sky rocketed way beyond the normal ranges they look at 2 numbers AST and ALT Even though Im not a heavy drinker the doctor had me stop all alcohol for 6 weeks and then I was retested The results were exactly the same as before so alcohol wasnt the culprit The doctor wanted to send me to the hospital for additional tests including to check for hepatitis to see why I was exhibiting liver damage I asked if I could try fasting from Montelukast for 6 weeks first before undergoing a bunch of other tests and the doctor agreed because he said I wasnt in danger However he didnt think Montelukast was the cause I had a feeling it was Montelukast because nothing else had changed in the last few years other than that After 6 weeks of not taking Montelukast I was retested and my liver numbers dropped by HALF My AST was back in the normal range and my ALT was just above the high normal which is nothing to worry about Therefore I was right it was the Montelukast that was causing my liver damage This medication may be cheaper but its more detrimental to me physically and isnt worth the savings to me The pollen count is highest between 6 am and 9 am and again at dusk so plan your workouts for other times of the day when pollen levels are lower says Michael Blaiss MD a past president of the American College of Allergy Asthma  Immunology ACAAI and a practicing allergist in Memphis Tenn If you go out during highpollen times wear a face mask designed to filter out pollens says Murray Grossan MD an ear nose and throat physician and author of Free Yourself from Sinus and Allergy Problems  Permanently As soon as you arrive home rinse out your nose with saline to remove pollen still in your nose Grossan says Two antiallergy nasal sprays that enable you to exercise with high pollen levels include Astelin and Patanase Ask your allergist It also helps to know what triggers your allergies There are different readings for different types of pollens Blaiss says Tree pollen levels above 50 are high for example while one to 10 is considered low Check a web site such as that of the American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology which tracks pollen counts for trees mold weeds and grass across the US WebMD allergy consultant Paul Enright MD an Arizonabased pulmonologist says its important for children with allergies to avoid pollen when possible Heres what Enright suggests to lighten your childs allergy load during pollen season If the child is allergic to outdoor allergens ragweed or other weeds grasses trees determine when they are in bloom You can ask your allergist or check your daily newspaper or a weather web site for the latest pollen count In addition keep the child indoors whenever possible and close the windows of the home to reduce outdoor allergens from coming indoors You may also consider running a HEPA room air cleaner in the childs bedroom minimize cats and dogs coming indoors from outdoors even if the child is not allergic to the pet since their fur accumulates pollen and other outdoor allergens They promise to make your skin soft your hair shiny and your laundry springtime fresh but for some people the chemicals in shampoos cosmetics and detergents trigger allergic skin reactions I am allergic to cats and when I visit my brothers house they have 4 cats my eyes start to itch within the hour My nose is running an hour later I am wheezing pretty badly inside 4 hours Now I know to dose myself with LOTS of benedryll like 5075 mg  I have an unusually High tolerance  I would not recommend this for everyone  the usual dose is 25 mg and that makes most people drowsy before stepping in the door That lets me get through dinner and out the door without having to pull out the epipen Girlfriend 18 Been to many doctors and dermatologists Puffy swollen burning painful lips Over 2 years w problem continuously Had allergy patch Not allergies Biopsy showed only inflammation Medications eletone oral and topical steroids elidel vitamin b pills alpha lipoic acid doxycycline hcl doxepin sertraline protopic tacrilimus and amitriptyline hcl Steroids helped a lot Eletone kind of does for few minutes at a time Nothing else works Losing hope Please help This should be fine I have done this myself during bad allergy seasons And I would need to switch at times between Claritin Zyrtec or Allegra  which ever one worked for that season and a Benedryl or two at night Currently I get allergy shots You may want to look into that It does require a commitment to stay on schedule and not all insurance companies cover it And because of the shots I have not needed Benedryl at all this season and it was a really bad season this year I also now take Xyzal 5mg which uses the most common ingredient in Zyrtec It is prescribed and not yet OvertheCounter like Zyrtec but worth asking your physician about And it is taken at night as opposed to every morning You may want to ask about either Flonase or QNasl I am on QNasl now one spray per nostril every morning as opposed to Flonase 2 sprays per nostril twice a day QNasl is new so there are no generics yet and may require you to try Flonase first aka Step Therapy but sometimes there is a coupon from the manufacturer to help bring the cost down It works by acting like secondary pharmacy insurance after your insurance pays It is a program you have to enroll with the manufacturer I used to have to take all these allergy pills and now I am down to one pill one spray and allergy shots Good luck Try some allergy eye drops you can get them at wal mart If its not better by the next morning he does need to go to the doctor A lip burning sensation may result from abnormal sensations in the lips due to nerve damage or dysfunction Lip burning sensation may also result from different types of lip burns or even chapped lips Maybe this will help httpwwwlocalhealthcomarticlelipburningsensation I wonder if you do have a mold or dust problem or maybe caused by wall to wall carpet Another thing to check is whether or not you have a gas leak if you have a gas ovenstove My oven sometimes starts leaking  whereas most people think about their stove only \tIt you decide to buy some meds try taking one for a day or two and see what happens I have read that you can become allergic to something any time during your life so you make think you arent allergic to anything but you are If your reactions are severe go to a doctor Some reactions can be very dangerous If the mucus  from your nose  is dark yellow or greenish  you have a bacterial sinus infection  see an ENT for evaluation I had it for quite awhile before being diagnosed  ugh Good luck Only YOUR body can cause an allergic reaction Your body is reacting to something it views as a threat or invader A bite cant cause an allergy but it can cause your body to have a reaction The prior bite is probably unrelated to your symptoms Especially since it happened 3 months ago and youre still having issues Keep in mind that you can develop an allergy at any point Example Perhaps you drink Orange Juice every day3 times a day You can even develope an allergy in the same day Imagine drinking the first and second glass of OJ and be just fine Then you could drink the third glass and have a reaction Because of your eye symptoms it makes me think its more likely youre allergic to something in the air Im sure youve heard of hayfever However latex allergies can be very dangerous Lets say you have a SEVERE reaction and need to go to the Emergency Room Guess what The Drs and nurses will be touching you with latex gloves which would make it worse You need to be tested to find out your allergen What it is thats causing your bodys reaction You can have your doctor test you or even use one of the home allergy tests they have on the market now May I suggest trying herbal supplements an maybe organic foods an see what happens Your friend needs to seek medical attention right away Take him to the emergency room Take her back to her allergist as soon as you can I dont know if her Dr prescribed the Zyrtec but there are other medicines that can control the other symptoms  And be sure to be following the advice of the allergist It may be something else triggering her allergies or asthma My daughter takes Nasonex along with Oceans nasal spray and Asmenex Twist Inhaler for breathing then also Loratidineand those seem to do the trick for her But shes never been given Zyrtec Hope this helps I am no expert but it could be Photodermatitis If you use ANY kind of acne medication on your face like benzoly peroxide or oral medication the chances of this happening is greater I have had the same problem and found i am allergic to grass I just take an over the counter allergy medicine There are so many different companies producing tattoo in right now that it would be very difficult to answer this question with a yes or a no My suggestion would be to go to the tattoo shop that youre interested in getting tattooed at and ask the artist directly Any reputable artist will either have the answer or the ability to answer it yes you should  I think you should see an ENT I suffered with sinus infections for many years with nosebleeds sinus pressure daily headaches facial pain congestion drainage etc I also tried anything you can buy OTC and prescriptions Last year I saw an ENT had a CT Scan and a few months later I had sinus surgery which included scrapingcleaning out my sinus cavities and correcting a deviatied septum Healing time was within what they consider a normal range and the pain was not as bad as I had expected it to be I had surgery in August and was allergy tested in December and recently began allergy shots It has been a long process but I am finally starting to feel better If you are going to see an ENT I would talk to friends family members people who can recommend one to you that they have seen and are happy with The practice I go to has a website entcarolinacom and they offer some helpful advice information on procedures testing etc i hope this helps good luck Have you tried any nasal rinses I have horrible sinuses and allergies My ENT doctor recommended a saline sinus rinse and it works really well Check out your local pharmacies and consult with the pharmacist There are a variety of rinses Hope it helps Same thing with me and wheat Happens to a lot of people whether they want to admit or not Even the French Im not a doctor but I would think thats oversdosing a bit Check the box itself It usually says what you can and cant take with it Does prednisolone acetate eye drops help eye allergies One or more of your tear ducts may be blocked Call your Ophthalmologist right away before it turns into an infection go to the doctors and see what they have to say  maybe its the gloves  Have you changed anything Detergent softeners new clothes wout washing first new bed just about anything including a once not allergic to a food allergy is he on antibiotics My now 10 then 8 went through this he broke out every day for 3 days once covered half of his body however benadryl made it go away so it saved me trips to the ER i did take pictures and give them to my sons pediatrician  It was around Halloween time and it stopped as fast as it started The closest I came to figuring it out was it was either the detergent so i switchedor his 2 costumes  try to think of anything thats different new activity with new surroundings anything Also hives can be caused by stress this too has happened as well to my son 12 is middle school and a hard age Good luck to you this depends on the dogs weight under 50 lbs 1

frustrating this problem is I have a similar problem with my left ear Mine stems from allergies or so I am told I have fluid on the ear which causes a feeling of it being plugged and also discomfort I tried all the usual over the counter aids and also was prescribed oral prednisone but to no avail in relieving my symptoms I even had an ear tube put in but was very little help My doctor finally gave me a Solu Medrol injection which rids your body of excess fluid Plus putting me on what they call an oral Medrol pack It works for me I have to go in about every three or four months for another round but it has been the only thing that has worked for me Good luck I hope this has been helpful Have you been tested for Ashma or Bronchitissounds like thats what might be going on beens you have had the cough for such a long time Or even have test for TB or Emphazema better safe that sorry right Best of luck to you I am a nurse with 4 other medical degrees so I cant diagnos you but I am leaning toward Bronchitis Any doctor will tell you do not use a medication if it is expired Even OTC meds I used to work in the medical field I will say things were more strict back then but expired drugs hasnt changed much Hope this helps I worked at an eye doctors officeYou need to see an eye doctor and stop using over the counter stuff We see this alot and most of the time its dry eye or an eye infection Your eyes are importantreally see an eye doctor "}
