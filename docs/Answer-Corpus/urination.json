{"text": "If the kidney stone does not pan out I might suggest seeing a chiropractor Your symptoms match what I go thru when my low back goes and I have a hip turned out of place It can affect many things Another indicator would be if you have urinary seepage Based on my personal experience the person having such complaints faces frequent urination due to the blockage made by the stone and is never satisfied The urinary bladder fills again  again in intervals due to stone blockage Are you a man if so so you need your prostate checked as if it is enlarged this will cause the problem HAs he been tested for asthma His weight sounds like it may be affecting his daily life  Poor buddy  no kid should not be able to play and run  Could Be Infection Contact A Doctor I am hoping that the doctor did a urinalysis in addition to a urine culture The culture would have been the best way to lok for infection and a urine analysis often by dipstick would have screened for sugar in the urine which could be a signal of diabetes If the urine culture and urinalysis are both normal negative then that is pretty reassuring It is possible that he had a urinary accident that you are unaware of which has now sensitized him to going frequently If this continues or gets worse a CAT scan or MRI may be needed to be sure that there is nothing anatomically affecting the urinary tract In either case you should followup with your doctor by telephone or in person within the week He may ask you to collect all of his urine and monitor his fluid intake He may also do some blood work to be sure there is no other evidence of kidney problems Cannot see the question due to your 3 articles  1 video in a box directly on top of the questions It IS possible to have both at the same time but if you think you go ta yeast infestion from sex is it possible that you may have an STD rather than a yeast infection If the OTC meds dont take care of the problem in the number of days you are supposed to use it Id definitely get checked for an STD Finding the cause for your low potassium needs to be the first objective Here is a list of some possible reasons for low potassium 1 Sometimes low potassium is a symptom of some other problem For example having low magnesium l evels can be a contributing cause for low potassium It may be difficult in these cases to stabilize potassium levels until magnesium levels are increased Routine serum blood studies do not always uncover low magnesium 2 Consuming foods that are insufficient or lacking in nutrients necessary to maintain potassium at an optimal level can be a real challengeYes consuming foods that are rich in required nutrients is a worthy objective But due to hectic life styles and the frequent fast eating of fast foods your diet may comeup lacking in potassium 3 Some medications can cause low potassium levels Be especially careful in taking laxatives and diuretics which can deplete potassium levels 4 Electrolyte imbalances as seen with vomiting and diarrhea can also cause potassium levels to plummet 5 Some digestive irregularities as seen in conditions like Crohns DiseaseGluten Sensitivity issues and Irritable Bowel Syndrome can cause fluid loss and ultimately to cause low potassium levels 6 Drinking alcoholic beverages to excess drinking large amounts of tea coffee and soda can cause excessive urination and result in potassium depletion Here are my recommendations as a lay person who has had family members suffering the negative effects of having low potassium levels   Start a food diary listing as best you can with only a few days until your followup appointment all foods and beverages that are being ingested Also annotate any physical or emotional symptoms like excessive sweating feeling anxious muscle cramps lightheadedness thirst and overall body weakness  For the immediate time follow your doctors plan of action Keep that appointment with your doctor to follow up with the results achieved  Show your diary to the doctor along with an updated list of all prescription medications and over the counterdrugsThat person has been highly trained in nutrition pharmacology and medical conditions Digestive problems absorption defects low magnesium levels and many other problems may be uncovered by your physician who is also a diagnostic detective  Once the cause of your low potassium level is determined then an effective treatment plan may be started Your question provided specific and helpful details It was a great question Right up to the beginning of your final sentence Why would you suspect cancer I know that you are feeling uncomfortable and probably more than a little frustrated it is understandable But for the time being I would put cancer near the bottom of my list of possible causes for your condition Your PSA result was 12 and you had 2 DREs with normal results Urinary frequency can have many causes including infections injury to the bladder dietary influences urinary bladder stones benign enlargement of the prostate gland diabetes  medication side effects etc Treatment of frequent urination is directed at the specific cause Please do not give up in your quest for a diagnosis of this condition Many treatments are availableJust for example the following link is from a WebMD article citing twentytwo 22 different medications to treat frequent urinationThe first task that is necessary prior to treatment should be to ascertain the reason for your frequent urination httpwwwwebmdcomdrugscondition3258IncreasedUrinaryFrequencyaspxdiseaseid3258diseasenameIncreasedUrinaryFrequencysource0 Depending on the cause in office non surgical procedures as well as surgical procedures are available in addition to medications as possible treatment options through your urologist If your urologist is not investigating and testing for all medical and nonmedical causes of your condition then seeking a 2nd opinion from another urologist is justified With treatments for frequent urination readily available you deserve some resolution to your condition Yes clinical studies investigating possible Wellbutrin side effects report that its usage may contribute to Almost all of this drug and its metabolites are excreted through the kidney It has been recommended by various pharmacology sources that individuals with kidney related conditions should only use Wellbutrin at its lowest possible dosage Frequent urination during the sleeping hours is referred to as Nocturia  It can occur at any age but becomes more of an issue as we get older By definition the individual awaking at lease two times per night to void meets the guidelines for Nocturia  The causes for this condition may be as a result of indiscriminate drinking of large quantities of liquids prior to bedtime taking diuretics too close to bedtime or untreated medical conditions Some of these medical conditions may include diabetes heart disease or be urologic in nature Urologic conditions may include an enlarged prostate gland in males improper sphincter control and urinary tract infections I recommend that you stop drinking liquids at least one 1 2 two hours prior to retiring Take any diuretic medications as instructed but talk to the pharmacist andor doctor about any water pills taken during the late afternoon and evening hours Start keeping a log of the fluids taken in include the name of the liquid quantity and timedate taken in Record all voiding activity as to datetime quality of stream urine color and the estimated urine quantity During sleeping hours an inexpensive portable recorder might be helpful Make an appointment with your doctor and obtain a referral to be seen by a Urologist to have a complete urologic exam and assessment There are urologic treatments including medications that can help in reducing the Nocturia symptoms Urinating 4  8 times per hour is not normal and I am certain that it is disturbing Her are my recommendations I hope that this answer has been helpful Running to the restroom more then 8 times a day skin is very itchy Low testosterone can cause a drop in sex drive poor erections and enlarged breast Its common in men and there are treatment options that include injections patches gels etc  One possible side effect of testosterone treatment is an enlargement of the prostate or BPH with symptoms that can cause urinary frequency In men this hormone is responsible for features such as facial pubic and body hair It also helps maintain your sex drive and sperm production The symptoms you describe seem more directly related to prostate or bladder problems rather than a low testosterone Speak with your doctor to get examined and treated if needed Could be a urinary tract infection UTI Go see your doctor for a urinalysis or urine culture For your any dental problem click here  confidentdentalcare But Peyronies is unusual in young people Its fairly unusual in general And if your BF is at a young age the doctor is more likely to suspect some vigorous masturbation is or did cause some irritation that is occasionally triggering some pain as a tiny injury gets triggered when you move something the wrong way Like a little hitch in your shoulder from moving something wrong everything is fine until you move it just the wrong way and then you get a shooting pain Im not saying that he doesnt has an infection Its unlikely he and doctor will know exactly what the source is even after investigating unless its very obvious Riding a bicycle regularly doing strenuous exercise not drinking enough water lots of things can contribute to tiny injuries in your urogenital system that can feel like a stabbing pain when they get irritated by another activity Of course no pain is normal and its good that you both are willing to figure out whats wrong What Im trying to encourage you to do is to pursue a resolution without any wait and see breaks Because in some circumstances waiting makes the situation worse and harder to resolve I dont want you to fall into that mode of inactivity where you

medications and even vitamins can change the color of urine temporarily but eliminating the cause brings the color back to normal Most changes in urine color are harmless and the color will go back to normal within a day or two Some colors require more attention A reddish tinge can mean that blood is present in the urineor it can mean that you just ate beets or blackberries urine color tends to turn purplish red afterwards If the reddish tinge continues over several days after youve eliminated foods that may be causing the color you should mention it to your primary care provider Greenish urine can mean that you have a urinary tract infection but if its bright green it can mean that you have too much of B vitamins Certain drugs and some health conditions can cause urine to turn green too so mention this to your health care professional Urine with a bluish tint can mean some type of bacterial infection or may just mean that you have a high level of calcium If this persists give your health care professional a call Brown urine can indicate a potentially serious condition and you should contact your doctors office for help Sometimes laxatives can temporarily turn urine brown but if this dark color stays get it checked out  If your urine is dark amber in color and has a strong odor too it may indicate that its extremely concentrated This can happen after heavy exercise and sweating and means that you need to drink more water to avoid dehydration If the extra water intake doesnt lighten the color and odor of your urine you may have other conditions that require medical attention such as a urinary tract infection or even early diabetes Sometimes foods cause urine to have an odor asparagus for example but the odor should go away after a few hours or overnight If a strong odor persists its time to contact your health care provider and have a urine test to determine the cause  If your urine is cloudy and then clears up later in the day and you have no other symptoms you probably have nothing to worry about Eating a large meal or drinking lots of milk can cause urine to be cloudy temporarily Women may also have a small amount of vaginal discharge mixing with urine that makes it look a little cloudythis is also usually not a problem so do not worry If cloudiness persists and you have other symptomspain and burning during urination a feeling of urgency or even fever for exampleyou need to talk to your primary care provider about it as you may have a urinary tract infection or other condition requiring treatment If your urine is dark amber in color and has a strong odor too it may indicate that its extremely concentrated This can happen after heavy exercise and sweating and means that you need to drink more water to avoid dehydration If the extra water intake doesnt lighten the color and odor of your urine you may have other conditions that require medical attention such as a urinary tract infection or even early diabetes Sometimes foods

test to determine the cause I can hear the frustration in your question Its always annoying when we do what were told and our medical problem still doesnt clear up Unfortunately only your doctor can tell you whats going on I can tell you that some infections require more than one course of antibiotics to treat Or they require a very specific antibiotic Because your physician knows your medical history he or she can look into this further to determine what the best course of action is Im sorry youre going through this All of us in medicine sometimes wish we had a magic wand in order to cure peoples conditions immediately As of right now were still waiting Hang in there Lack of a bowel movement for 3 days doesnt by itself indicate constipation Constipation is defined based on each individuals normal bowel habits Some people only have one bowel movement every few days Other people have a BM every day You need to determine your boyfriends normal bowel routine before jumping to a conclusion of constipation Assuming this is constipation however if laxatives pills arent working you have some other overthecounter options to try If your boyfriend is otherwise healthy he probably can safely drink a bottle of magnesium citrate liquid laxative Follow this immediately with 8 ounces of water Usually this will induce a bowel movement pretty rapidly If that doesnt work you can try a glycerine suppository This is inserted into the rectum to induce a BM Use it only as directed on the label Or you can try a disposable enema often called a Fleet enema Enemas are generally considered safe to use and will help get those bowels moving again No guy I know would voluntarily submit to an enema You need to emphasize to him that small disposable enemas arent too uncomfortable to use  and theyre way less uncomfortable than emergency surgery for a bowel resection due to an obstruction Maybe that will help persuade him if things get to that point If your boyfriend still cant have a bowel movement starts vomiting andor begins running a fever over 101F you need to seek immediate medical treatment These could be signs of a bowel obstruction or something unrelated to constipation Wishing you both all the best Usually this type of sensation is caused by a nerve malfunction  either compression of the nerve root at the spine or some other localized nerve irritation If youre having this sensation frequently its worth getting checked out by a medical professional With a physical exam and perhaps some additional testing like an MRI your health care provider can determine if this sensation is caused by something like in your lower spine A condition like that may need to be monitored as it will only get worse over time I should note also that other conditions could cause the type of sensation youre describing which is why it would be a good idea to have this evaluated if its happening frequently If this sensation only occurs occasionally you probably dont need to be concerned Minor nerve irritation causing symptoms happens to all of us from time to time I hope this helps Sorry to hear youre going through this It sounds like youve done the right thing by seeing your doctor and having your heart and kidneys checked out Im not sure why youre taking aspirin unless your doctor specifically recommended you take it Aspirin will not address the swelling issue you describe Aspirin will treat swelling due to inflammation such as from an injury to some extent but it will not have any effect on swelling due to edema water retention which is what you seem to be describing I suggest you discontinue the aspirin unless otherwise directed by your doctor It is not uncommon for people to retain fluid in the legs as they age Even very active people can have issues with fluid retention in the legs simply because the veins dont work as well when we age I suggest you return to your doctor to discuss the issue in more detail Its possible as you say he does not have an answer for the swelling problem But its also possible the issue simply requires more investigation to arrive at a diagnosis If youre concerned about the swelling and frequent urination I would be then thats a good enough reason to return to your doctor for more conversation Wishing you well This is an excellent question and Im glad you asked it Its also kind of a hard question to answer Everyones bathroom habits are different Usually when we talk about frequent urination we mean more frequently than is normal for you But because  specifically is a disease that can come on gradually you may not notice that your urinary frequency has increased If youre urinating every hour that probably would generally be considered frequent If your urine has a sort of sweet smell thats another telltale sign of potential diabetes The only way to know for sure if you have Type 2 diabetes is to get some lab work done Dont be afraid to know the truth Untreated diabetes can have longterm health consequences Its better to find out early and seek early treatment than to go along in denial and damage your kidneys or lose your eyesight Id suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider He or she can help you not only determine whether or not you have diabetes but also discuss ways you can take control of your overall health and wellbeing Wishing you all the best First thank you for being there when so many people needed you As everyone else ran away from the disaster you ran it  and that makes you special Second Im so sorry you had to go through all the horrors of that day and I hope you have received appropriate medical and psychological care in the years that have passed I always answer is it possible questions this way Anything is possible The better question is How likely is it In the case of kidney cancer not very likely The most common type of kidney cancer is called renal cell carcinoma and it accounts for only about 3 of all adult cancers diagnosed each year Thats pretty rare To survive 10 years with an undiagnosed case would be unheard of Many of the symptoms you describe would not be associated with kidney cancer I hope this knowledge serves to ease your mind as opposed to making you wonder what else could be causing these things There is so much we do not know regarding the health issues of first responders to the 911 incident Could your symptoms be caused by conditions at the WTC that day Maybe Could the symptoms be totally unrelated to 911 Maybe Your best bet is to seek continuing care from a single provider who can track your health across the lifespan Only through diligent followup and reporting can you hope to pinpoint the causes of the symptoms you describe Wishing you peace and wellness Im sorry your bladder issue is disrupting your sleep How annoying Since youre already taking an appropriate medication I suggest you have a chat with your health care provider to see if the dosage is right Or maybe you need a different medication for the overactive bladder One thing you can do is stop drinking fluids close to bedtime I realize oxybutynin can cause dry mouth and other unpleasant side effects but cutting of liquids within a couple of hours of bedtime might help you avoid waking up at night The best advice though is to discuss this nighttime urination problem with your health care provider to get personalized advice Best of luck to you Unfortunately its impossible to tell what the problem might be without a physical examination Difficulty urinating is not a symptom to be taken lightly It could be caused by a urinary tract infection kidney infection or even a stone Any of these conditions could cause additional problems if not treated The difficulty urinating also could contribute to the nausea and vomiting If these symptoms dont clear up quickly Id suggest you seek immediate medical treatment Hope this helps Youre a good grandpa to notice this and be concerned Id suggest the boys parents speak to their pediatrician about this Several conditions can cause a boy to have a sideways stream like that A couple of possible reasons that come to mind which Im including for informational purposes and as examples only include urethral polyps and meatal stenosis Both of these are treatable The boys pediatrician should be able to investigate this situation further and arrive at a diagnosis and appropriate treatment Again good for you for noticing this and calling attention to it I wish you and your grandson all the best Good question I cant answer specifically because you didnt mention the name of the antibiotic youre taking However WebMDs website offers a search feature that allows you to look up drug names and view specific side effects In general its not uncommon for any antibiotic to cause abdominal pain Im not familiar with increased urination as a side effects of antibiotics but you have to bear in mind that everyones body responds differently to any given drug If youre concerned about these side effects I suggest you call your health care provider to report them I would not recommend stopping the antibiotics without being told to do so by your physician Take care The only thing you really need to do is shower And you dont even need to overdo the shower Just apply some soapy water and rinse thoroughly Its highly unlikely you would get any sort of infectious disease from a cat urinating on you Maybe if you ingested the urine or something but not from simply getting it on your skin Its not even likely youd catch something if the urine contacted your vulva So take a deep breath and jump in the shower Youll be fine Wishing you well Call Your Dr Immediately or go to the Emergency room That is just what I would do You need to go to the hospitalthe infection couldve spread to your blood system and you could die This almost happened to me Go to a free clinic or something I am sure that gonorrhea could be transferred through kissing IF the girl had given oral sex to another man I would be depressed and puzzled too Good luck You should get that checked out asap Dont sound good A friend of mine has four children and all of them have had variations of this problemcant feel the urge to pee pees in pants needs stool softener All of her children were diagnosed with vesicoureteral reflux to some degree or another The oldest child had surgery to correct this when she was 4 yrs old but none of the other children required surgery Have you had your daughters kidney function tested Hopefully it is nothing serious but kidney problems are nothing to fool around with and catching kidney problems early is key to prevent permanent kidney damage Please see a urologist ASAP I feel terrible for your poor girl and hope youshe get answers soon I recommend you get screened for diabetes Are you thirsty as well Good luck  bladder cancer is extremely rare in young adults especially as you have no blood in your urine If youre not drinking alcoholic beverages prior to bedtime then you may be drinking fluids too soon before bed Try not drinking anything 2  3 hours before going to bed Next time this occurs get screened for diabetes Good luck About one in three women leak urine after giving birth This is called stress incontinence and its due to weakened pelvic floor muscles allowing for the neck of the bladder to sag down so that urine can escape with laughing coughing or sneezing Most doctors tell women to do Kegel exercises to strengthen their pelvic floor muscles In some cases surgery is required But studies have also shown that vaginal weights can strengthen the muscles enough to reduce incontinence as well Heres how they work You insert a coneshaped weight into your vagina and then work on squeezing your muscles to keep the weights in place for about 15 minutes once or twice a day You can actually go about your daily business while doing this Once youre able to hold this weight in easily you try a slightly heavier weight They are sold in sets Advocates of the weights believe that its easier for a woman to learn to isolate and train her pelvic floor muscles properly using the weights than it is using just Kegels which are easy to do incorrectly You can get vaginal weights overthecounter online or as a prescription via your health care provider A slow urine stream is more common in men as they age Finally they have something worse than we do This is not a common complaint among menopausal or perimenopausal women Some possible causes of a slowed stream could be either structural such as bladder outlet obstruction or a neurologic condition leading to a problem initiating urination If this slowed stream persists you should consult your GYN or a urologist You may need additional testing from a urogynecologist or urologist to get the most accurate diagnosis Hi I have had 4 previous pregnancies I have children aged 10 8 4 and 2 With my second I tested negative for pregnancy this was picked up by blood test when I went to the Doctor for pain The hgc levels rose too slowly and they thought him to be eptopic but then found him behind a large cyst I was 8 weeks My pregnancies with my last two girls I had 2 periods or period type bleeds with each My period was due on the 9th of January I am usually quite regular Instead I had pain in my lower right ovary location and headaches and cramps all the signs of a period My period then arrived on the 13th I started to feel sick the pain on the left increased and I also had pain in the right My period lasted 3 days and was half its normal flow or at least I used half the pads maybe less than half changing them to be clean rather than them being full I went to the Doctor he put me on the pill and said to come back in two weeks In the last week I am having cramps they feel like braxton hicks this is the only thing I am able to relate them too I have pressure down there The pain on both the left and the right has gone I am now feeling a bulge above my pubic bone it seems to be a pointed bulge It is bigger before I urinate and when I am standing and my jeans have become uncomfortable I still have a week before I go back to the Doctor but this is worrying me now I feel more sick every day but I understand this could be nerves I do not think I am a candidate for hysterical pregnancy I did suffer 2 weeks feeling incredibly broody in early December but quickly resorted back to my feeling of not wanting any more monsters lol The Doctor put me on the pill to ease my pregnancy symptoms and said to come back if the pain persists but it has stopped Is there anything you can tell me to put my mind at rest My Doctor gave me a look I am nervous about waiting to go back and nervous to go back in case he thinks I am wasting his time Thankyou Jasmine I forgot to mention that I had pre cancerous cells burnt away last year yes you need to seek medical attention You need to contact a Gynecologist not a regular primary care dr Have the gynocologist do an internal exam to make sure the pain is from your uterus that would be my guess But you need to be seen by a specialist you may need surgery That is not usual Usually women will just urinate a lot but anyway when women are pregnant they start to have chemical changes What you have is a urinary infection that comes from the kidneys Pregnant women will sometimes get the infection but that does not mean there is no cure The infection is caused by germs and viruses that can make you sick If you are still unsure of why you urine blood then it is a good idea to check in with a doctor and tell himher the painful condition that you are going through This illness can lead to cases like high fever vomiting and other discomforts So go to your doctor and he or she might give you a medication That is probably caused by the extra fluids in your moms system that she gets rid of so the bladder will overfill itself You should see your moms therapist and she should do a physical checkup to see what is going on Are you drinking a lot of fluids Do you have an overactive bladder My suggestion to you would be to speak with your doctor first of all and to rule out any medical conditions I dont think that anyone other than your doctor will be able to help you with this This could be a number of different things I myself have had the same issue and it happens off and on but mine is because I am not emptying my bladder completely and it is also unfortunately associated with my Fibromyalgia You might suffer on urinary incontinance you should visit urologist There are differnt treatments one of them is to take special drug called Amitriptiline which closes the bladder neck during the night and this way you dont have such accidents Only your urologist can treat this conditionand prescribe the medication Amitriptilane is used for young wet blatters and at the same time antidepressant for children I have not started taking the Chantix yet but the medication that I received from the Pfizer Patient Assistance Foundation has 3 bottles of blue pills and I keep reading the posted direction attached to the medication reading information such as Day 1 to Day 3 White tablet 05 mg I am not a doctor but wanted to respond to the nutritional aspects Some of the symptoms you list such as frequent urination are symtpoms of type 1 diabetes Im not saying you have it but it is worth being checked out As for the dizzy feelings after sugar its hard to say I would aim to eat balanced meals with a protein healthy fat whole grains and fruits and vegetables If you eat sugar do so after a balanced meal or snack Eating sugary foods on an empty stomach may contribute to the dizzy feelings The best possible thing to do is get a physical that includes lab work to make sure everything is okay In the meantime focus on taking care of yourself by eating well and getting sleep That is a large amount to take considering the recommended amount for adults is 30 micrograms I would check with your healthcare provider on the amounts and possible medical connections I can find no reason to think it would cause a yeast infection For side effects and more info see this Having low potassium is not always due to diet but fluid balance Thats because potassium along with sodium helps regulate body fluids they are called electrolytes so when fluid changes occur with certain disease states or medications like diuretics it can go too low or high Diet cannot always correct changes in potassium so working with your doctor on the appropriate medical management will be key If you are getting worse call your doctor to see if you need to go in earlier It is important to know which foods have potassium and how to balance your intake which this WebMD article discusses in detail Also eating well moderate exercise and good sleep will only help you feel better Hope you feel better soon Sti Dysuria is pain or discomfort with urination The discomfort may be a sensation of itching irritation tingling or burning Dysuria occurs most often in women suffering from urinary tract infections Sexually transmitted infections blocked urine flow low estrogen levels in women or prostatitis in men can also cause dysuria Not being able to urinate at all despite a strong urge to is an urgent problem Usually the severe discomfort or pain that results drives a person to seek medical attention quickly More commonly people have difficulty urinating In men this is commonly caused by an enlarged prostate gland The urethra the tube through which urine passes travels through the prostate on its way to the penis The prostate may slowly grow with age and in some men this squeezes the urethra and reduces urine flow Medications can shrink or relax the muscles in the prostate and bladder improving urination If medication fails prostate surgery can restore urine flow Women who cant urinate may have a urinary tract infection UTI and antibiotics may be necessary Other causes of blocked urination include medications kidney stones tumors in the abdomen or pelvis or a narrowed urethra from past infections Not being able to urinate at all despite a strong urge to is an urgent problem Usually the severe discomfort or pain that results drives a person to seek medical attention quickly More commonly people have difficulty urinating In men this is

sometimes have a urinary tract infection UTI and antibiotics may be necessary Other causes of blocked urination include medications kidney stones tumors in the abdomen or pelvis or a narrowed urethra from past infections  The causes of gross and microscopic blood in urine hematuria are similar and may result from bleeding anywhere along the urinary tract One cannot readily distinguish between blood originating in the kidneys ureters the tubes that transport urine from the kidneys to the bladder bladder or urethra Any degree of blood in the urine should be fully evaluated by a physician even if it resolves spontaneously Infection of the urine stemming either from the kidneys or bladder is a common cause of microscopic hematuria Kidney and bladder stones can cause irritation and abrasion of the urinary tract leading to microscopic or gross hematuria Trauma affecting any of the components of the urinary tract or the prostate can lead to bloody urine Hematuria can also be associated with renal kidney disease as well as hematologic disorders involving the bodys clotting system Medications that increase the risk of bleeding such as aspirin warfarin Coumadin or clopidogrel Plavix may also lead to bloody urine Lastly cancer anywhere along the urinary tract can present with hematuria U R Dehydrated Drink fluids mainly water i suggest Hi If you have been having unprotected sex this could have been a miscarriage some of you symptoms match If your still worried I would see your doctor Do hope this has helped Good Luck Hi IT seems from want your that you are not alone there are more with the same symptoms as you The best advice I could find was go see a lawyer dealing in your cases so follow this link The link httpwwwfarahandfarahcomrcmeshherniarepairmeshhtml Just see how you go with them Good Luck Hi OK then its time to do a HPT or go to your doctor a do a test with himher and see how things go Or it could be just a skipped period from as you say stress But OK its time you started some kind of BC just to be on the safe side for your future sex life the last thing you need at 16 is to get pregnant if not always carry condoms best to be safe that sorry Do hope this helps Good Luck Hi found you this nice piece of info from Dr Dhide The simple answer to that is yes many antibiotics do affect menstrual periods The mechanism of how that happens is mainly related to reducing the available estrogen hormone which can lead to a change in the cycle and make it irregular Details As you are aware in the first fourteen days of a 28 day menstrual cycle the follicle starts growing and the initial hormone production is mainly estrogen This starts making the lining of the endometrium thicker After ovulation estrogen is joined by progesterone from the corpus luteum making the endometrium denser and mature Estrogen is not only metabolized by the liver but also recirculated between the gut and the liver enterohepatic circulation Antibiotics can affect estrogen metabolism in two ways Most antibiotics are metabolized in the liver and their presence can affect the rate of metabolism of estrogen and progesterone This can change the supply of estrogen available in the blood and that can cause irregularity of the cycle Some antibiotics cause diarrhea like symptoms as they change the gut flora This causes excessive excretion of estrogen through the gut as there is less time for reabsorption of estrogen thus affecting the enterohepatic circulation This too reduces levels of estrogen in the blood Thus by changing the levels of estrogen in the blood the cycle will get disturbed because the pituitary gland secretes its hormones depending on the level of estrogen in the blood It is now getting the wrong information and wont act as expected Ovulation is dependent on the pituitary gland identifying that there is enough estrogen in the blood and all these delicate balances are scuppered on antibiotic treatment This way many antibiotics can cause irregular menstrual cycle The other point to note is you take antibiotics when you are not well But process itself can alter your bodys metabolic behavior and ability to maintain a steady level of the hormone One very practical point to note are antibiotics can affect the level of estrogen and progestin of the oral contraceptive pills This in turn can cause the OC pill to fail when antibiotics are used in the same time period Antiobiotics like Rifampicin Ampicillin and some Cephalosporins are particularly notorious for this Now being on antibiotics for 23 day solid is not good for you its just in case you need to be on antibiotics for something more serious they wont work Do hope this helps you Good Luck PS Look if your going to play around with sex and not to happy to get pregnant now would be the time to think about BC theres the BC PIll the ring the implant IUD or the cap or diaphragm but dont think about depo shot just to many side effects Hi I always thought one went and urinated to empty our bladders if thats the case why would you want to leave some behind do you have a gauge somewhere with a pointer

necessary and if so what is used Yeast infections often occur just before menses trichomonas just after Gonorrhea ascends to the upper tract postmenses Postmenopausal women are less likely to have yeast and more likely to have noninfectious causes Pregnancy and birth control pills predispose to yeast infections Ask if the discharge is acute chronic or frequently recurrent Discharges that patients claim never go away are likely to be bacterial vaginosis if pathologic or simply physiologic discharges Ask specifically about pruritus internal dysuria felt inside the body external dysuria felt on the labia dyspareunia irritation and offensive odor Internal dysuria suggests urinary infection gonorrhea or chlamydia External dysuria suggests vulvovaginal irritation with secondary burn from urine Candida is intensely pruritic trichomonas less so and bacterial vaginosis rarely Trichomonas and bacterial vaginosis can both cause dysuria usually external Bacterial vaginosis has a fishy odor trichomonas a foul one The intense inflammatory reaction of yeast or trichomonas can cause dyspareunia Herpes can cause intense external dysuria and pruritus Dop hope this has helped you Good

for you its putting you system into shock So dont just sit there go now Good Luck Hi This first bit is from the UK paper The Daily Mail This is an interesting question because although potassium is rarely in the limelight we actually need it in higher amounts than any other mineral  around 3500mg a day by adult men and women Potassium plays a fundamental role in maintaining the fluid and acidalkaline balance of the body It is vital for the transmission of nerve impulses and helps the heart to beat regularly It also counterbalances sodium in the body and is known to help lower blood pressure To get enough you need to eat plenty of fruit and vegetables which are especially good sources because they also provide a low level of sodium Healthwise its a high potassium to sodium ratio that really counts However several other foods also provide potassium including whole bread and pasta brown rice milk fish and meat The Dietary and Nutritional Survey of British Adults HMSO 1990 showed that the average intake of potassium is 3187mg in males and 2434mg in females Compared with the daily recommendation of 3500mg intakes they are therefore low To make up the difference eat an extra banana or two daily  each banana contains around 400mg People most at risk of marginal potassium include the elderly athletes and manual workers who sweat out a lot of potassium and people taking certain diuretic drugs Heavy coffee and alcohol drinkers may lack the mineral and should try to increase their dietary intake I think from this and other stuff around with your supplements you should be getting there but keep of any fast foods junk foods and sodas just keep eating healthy Do hope this helps Good Luck PS the extra urination is from all the fruit your eating same as the soft stools Hi OK at 42 a bit young but if I was you I would go in to your doctor or uro and get your prostate checked out and work away from that Do hope this helps you Good Luck Hi First she should see

develop UTIs than males its important to know the facts This guide was created so that you can learn about your urinary tract how you get a UTI symptoms available treatments and ways to prevent UTIs The urinary tract is the path for urine to go from your kidneys to the outside of your body Urine is made in the kidneys and then travels through hollow tubes called ureters to your bladder where the urine is stored When your bladder is full youll feel an urge to urinate pee The urine will leave your body through an opening called the urethra Urine is usually free of bacteria A urinary tract infection happens when bacteria gets inside your bladder usually through your urethra the opening where your urine comes out Females have shorter urethras than males do so it is easier for bacteria to enter the urinary tract and cause symptoms The most common kind of UTI is a bladder infection which is called cystitis sistitis If the infection affects your urethra it is called urethritis urethritis

Hi Try This its a bit old fashioned but as they say still in fashion Its a sae sale wash either from a bowl with a couple of tea spoonful in it or have a warm bath with a couple of handfuls and just soak it letting the water get round your vagina od it twice a day for 3 or 4 days Do hope this helps Good Luck PS Sea salt is soothing Hi I think you really need to see your doctor or uro this could all stem from one infection Good Luck It is possible that the act of intercourse or the condom caused irritation of the labia minora I am not sure if you had just had intercourse the second time you had the burning sensation If you did then that may very well be the reason It is also possible that there is a sexually transmitted infection despite your negative testing It depends on what you were tested for and what you were not tested for There are so many STDs that is would be very difficult to test for everything The most common testing is for Gonorrhea and Chlamydia In addition I usually recommend testing for Herpes as well as HIV The burning sensation may also be from a nonsexually transmitted infection such as yeast or bacteria Regardless you should schedule an exam and discuss this with your doctor Spermicidals such as films gels and sponges can cause irritation of the urethra in both men and women The urethra is the tube that drains the bladder to the outside However there are other causes of burning with urination It is important that you and your girlfriend see your doctors to make sure that neither one of you have an infection You may also want to consider another form of birth control because spermicidals are not as effective as many others Remember that it is always important to practice safe sex A condom would prevent the burning and help to prevent sexually transmitted diseases A number of factors can sometimes inhibit urination In addition to issues such as prostate swelling in middleaged males there are other influences possible Are you taking any type of medication that relaxes the smooth muscles that line your intestines If so these medications which tend to be anticholinergics will also inhibit the contraction of the detrusor muscle of the bladder which is responsible for forcing urine out through the urethra during urination A less common but still possible factor can be fecal impaction constipation if severe it can press internally against the urethra partially obstructing the bladder neck Although bladder infections UTIs usually cause urgency and even some incontinence some people instead report difficulty letting go during the infection and retention can make it become much worse If you have a lot of stinging and burning and it isnt a prostrate problem this might be checked out Another relatively rare condition that sometimes causes this type of thing is Interstitial Cystitis a chronic disease of the bladder that causes it to develop scar tissue between its muscular layers and gradually shrink but since IC doesnt usually onset quite so suddenly this isnt likely Still if troubles persist it might be checked out Another thing I should just mention is that sometimes STDs can cause urinary problems Its probably not that but if any possibility exists it should be ruled out There are of course other much more rare far more serious problems that it probably ISNT but if this continues unabated and everything else gets ruled out theyd eventually need to be considered They include injury to the spinal column neurogenic or cord bladder onset but youd almost certainly have very serious problems with walking and moving around too cancer of the prostate urethra bladder or anterior pelvic region injury to the genitals such as during sports or intercourse and one other thing Shy Bladder Syndrome which can onset in anyone at any age If your inability to urinate is by any chance accompanied by panic by obsession over whether youll be able to go by compulsions such as only urinating in certain places or in the total absence of other people worrying about whether they hear you or are waiting in line behind you and so forth it might be this but since you didnt mention anything of this sort in your query I assume it isnt something psychological In any case the problem with this overall situation is that if your urethra does close up completely so that you cannot go youll need to go to the ED to have them pass a catheter on you People are fond of claiming that you cannot really burst your bladder but if a persons urethra becomes totally blocked that is exactly what will happen Before the bladder bursts upward through the dome however it will probably reflux urine back upward through the ureters into the kidneys hydronephrosis and believe me if this was happening youd know it You would be rolling around screaming in pain long before it got to that point so dont worry that is NOT likely My only reason for mentioning it is that IF you do become TOTALLY unable to urinate AT ALL you do need to consider the situation an emergency at that point and head straight to the nearest hospital ED I have had that happen to me before and it wasnt fun but it was better than the alternative Get thee to a Urologist and find out what is going on Good Luck AHA Yes I thought you were FEMALE And I was right But based on the answers I saw from others I had first decided I was mistaken and thus much of my answer though not all of it does not pertain to a woman But some of what I contributed applies to both genders So its partially good anyway Knowing that youre a woman of 42 eliminates some of the issues discussed in my other essay above but adds some other more urgent concerns It makes some of the other things I discussed such as Interstitial Cystitis somewhat more likely And because women are more prone to UTIs than are men it means that if you do not have one already you may well develop one because of the retention You need to see your Gynecologist pronto tell her everything and have an exam and a cleancatch test to see if you have a UTI Ive had lifelong retention issues and Im cathetersensitive to boot so Ive had some unpleasant experiences at the hospital when I was completely unable to pass urine But that hasnt happened in awhile I wish I could recall the title of it but theres a wonderful book on womens urinary issues of all kinds written by urogynecologist Dr Larrian Gillespie Because her name is so unusual the book might be possible to find by referencing her name and the subject of womens urinary health issues That book might help you a great deal Its a truly wonderful book Sorry I was uncertain of your gender before I thought your name sounded female but Im new here and secondguessed my instincts Then I checked your profile and sure enough youre a She I feel like such a dweeb I certainly hope you feel better soon Be sure to see your Gyno this issue isnt one to ignore Ive so been there Again Good Luck to add because i was at the character limit had to post separately The itch is very slight and just mostly dis comfortable like i would have to adjust every so often I have no discharge and i plan to see a doctor i just dont have time today trying to go tomorrow I have no problems urinating also I started using Lotrimin today so hope that helps is this normal Some forms of anemia are NOT irondeficiency but other causes Your doctor may need to do some additional blood tests including one to see if you can bind the iron you are taking test is called Total Iron Binding Capacity Some oral forms of iron are more absorbable than others Painful urination with blood especially in someone who is diabetic is a urinary tract infection until otherwise proven Yes you need to see a medical provider but not necessarily the ER this is not an emergency a regular medical office or urgent care facility would be fine and less expensive In the meantime drink plenty of water I dont know anything about you to blindly determine a specific cause not even your sex If you are male and over the age of 50 it could be BPH benign prostatic hypertrophy If you are a female one would need to consider a urinary tract infection or variety of urinary tract problems And in either sex nocturia the medical name for this condition could be one of the signs of diabetes On a more simple case you could be drinking too much in the evening and not completely emptying your bladder See your medical providerthis is really the ONLY way to determine a reason and hopefully find a solution Your vaginal bumps and sores are not related to your urinary tract infection Up to 50 of all women have have classic symptoms of a UTI do not have positive urine cultures In other words the burning on urination is caused by something else Many times a women can have a subtle vaginal infection that can cause UTI symptoms or in your case sores due to  Since I have no way to see these bumps to offer you a patientspecific answer you will need to see your medical provider  someone who can examine you and make the determination You should be tested for diabetesyes A simple blood glucose test and a urine test is all you needand you dont even have to study for them While there are other medical reasons for these symptoms diabetes should be ruled out especially if it runs in your family You may be having a urinary spasm or urinary sphincter spasm Another possibility would be that you have urethritis inflammation of the distal urinary tube or tip of your penis  a common cause of urinary URGENCY Certain sexuallytransmitted disease can cause urinary symptom of this nature as well as prostate infections Less common especially in males would be a urinary tract infection Since you felt this for FOUR DAYS now perhaps it would be in your best interest to see a primary care medical provider  someone who care carefully examine you and run a few basic tests  to truly find the answer to this issue you are experiencing It is not the same I dont know the medical reason you were prescribed the diuretic water pill but just drinking more water will not accomplish the same goal Stay on that diuretic and discuss it with your doctor An allergy to your own urine is not possible Your labial itching may eventually help you overcome your fear of being examined since this may be the ONLY way you can have this problem properly diagnosed This is NOT something that can be done blindly over the Internet based solely on a vague description Having a sympathetic female physician PA or nurse practitioner should ease your discomfort and fear especially if you disclose it prior to your visit Have a trusted friend go with you Your doctor can even provide you with a shortacting antianxiety medication to help you overcome your fear In most cases a yeast infection is the underlying cause but since the labia is covered in skin and skin can have HUNDREDS of dermatological conditions that cause itching it would likely be futile to try and treat a condition that is not even diagnosed You most definitely should get another urine test culture If the lab tests are negative you may not need another course of antibiotics but other causes for your symptom array should be medicallyexplored by your doctor Before considering alternative therapies whatever you were planning it is best to be properly diagnosed The most likely cause would be an infectioneither a urinary tract infection or a vaginal infection In your case it could be both The urge to urinate is a primary symptom of a urinary infection but urethritis irritation of your urethra from vaginitis could also cause this annoying symptom You will need to see a medical provider so that you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated There can be many reasons but it would not be possible for me or any medical provider to be able to specifically determine that cause you YOUR testicle pain blindly over the Internet You will need to see your primary care medical provider or a urologist Altitude should not effect your ability to urinate You may have an enlarged prostate common at age 66 and difficulty urinating is commonat any altitude It may not mean anything or it could be an important symptom Since I do not know anything about his medical history or have any way of examining him taking a family history and ordering a blood and urine test it would be wise to discuss this with his medical provider One possibility could be juvenileonset diabetes type 1and I know you have been thinking about thisbut there can be MANY other reasons why a child would be urinating more than normal Get him checked out Not normal obviously This toddler sex unknown needs to be seen by a medical provider today to be properly examined and have both a urine test and a blood sugar test Frequency of urination needs a medical investigation including an examination and bloodurine tests to rule out diabetes mellitus See your primary care care provider first If your tests are normal then you will need to see a urologist This problem can be fixed but a cause will need to be medicallydetermined first A tampon will not affect the accuracy of a urine testthese are two different compartments A urine Chlamydia test or any other urine test would still be accurate whether you had a tampon in or not First holding your urine tends to become quite uncomfortable Second if you are female this can lead to urine stagnation and a urinary tract infection This is a bad habit Pee when your body sends you the signal to do so assuming you are in the proper place I dont know the age of your son or if he is having bedwetting issues but frequent nighttime urination could be due to many things For instance if he has a tendency to overdrink liquids in the evening he would more likely need to urinate throughout the night Sometimes little a boy will get irritation of their penis from soaps not rinsed well after a bath or shower laundry detergent or dryer softener residuals left in their clothing etc This can cause an irritant urethritis that makes him feel like he needs to urinate Less common but not out of the question would be a child who is developing diabetes Type 1 It would be wise to discuss this with his medical provider and have some lab tests Another possibility could be a deficiency of a natural hormone called ADH antidiuretic hormone The hormone is supposed to keep us from urinating often at night so if there is a deficiency the body will continue to process urine like we were awake during the day This is one cause of nocturnal enuresis otherwise known as bedwetting He could potentially be a bedwetter but instead is just waking up multiple times to urinate perhaps not sleeping well for fear that he will wet his pants or the bed If he does have an ADH deficiency this can be corrected by a medication called desmopressin DDAVP His medical provider will be able to determine if this would be helpful Get him in to see his medical provider Your son needs to be examined by his pediatrician or a pediatric urologist Sometimes there are congenital anomalies of the penis that will place the urethral opening too high or too low such as hypospadias or he could have some urethral adhesions that can be easily fixed I am not sure which way he is urinating up down sideways but I would have to say this is not normal Get it checked out Just get him to drink morenot just milk which can be constipating in some children The lack of bowel movement is not concerning as long as he is acting fine When you are not drinking sufficient fluids the body actually pulls water from the colon to use not the bladder There may not be any extra fluid for him to urinate so this is why you need to really encourage good hydration today Signs of dehydration in children would include dry eyes no tears and a dry mouth no saliva If he has wet eyes and mouth you can just hang in there a bit longer and see if increased fluids today will help Popsicles commerciallyavailable electrolyte solutions Jello ice chips etc all can entice a toddler to hydrate What happens The girl usually gets another boyfirend Is it safe Urine is usually sterile but may have a high gross factor If the guy is wearing a condom like he should urination could be a problem Is it possible Probably but wouldnt it be better for him to urinate in the toilet Yes you will need to see your medical provider so that you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated These are two different problems an ovarian cyst will not cause vaginal odor or an urge to urinate Vaginitis andor a urinary tract infection will need to be ruled out You may have urethritis or even a urinary tract infection While urinary infections are rare in men it can happen You will need to see your medical provider so you can be properly examined and tested While the chance of pregnancy is small it is not zero Semen that is excreted during sexual excitation can be loaded with viable sperm There is no way to calculate your chances of getting your girlfriend pregnant by this risky sex play so you will need to sweat it out She could take a morning after pill or you can just wait until she has or misses her next period Take this experience as a serious lesson Use a condom Your girlfriend should be on some sort of birth control Andyou should NOT be engaging in sexual activity that could end up with an unintentional pregnancy It is NOT normal to have a puslike discharge from the penis Since you are also having other unexplainable symptoms it would be wise to see a medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated  three things that cannot be accomplished over the Internet or by sitting it out Your fiance is not likely pregnant based on those negative tests but those things can be very frightening A late period can be due to stress It is biologically possible albeit rare to get pregnant if any rogue sperm somehow make it into the vagina at the time your partner is ovulating Seminal fluid  the clear fluid that will leak prior to ejaculation and during sexual stimulation  can have viable sperm living in it from a prior ejaculation so it is best not to have this type of genital to genital contact in the future unless you are wearing a condom or if your fiance is not taking any form of birth control Yes the transmission of the herpes virus can be oralgenital There are many different causes of vaginal irritation so before getting to worried see your medical provider or womens health professional for a proper examination diagnosis and treatment I suspect that she does know she is peeing in her pants during the day She just doesnt care She is busy playing and it is just easier to pee than interrupt what you are doing So it back to square one with some remedial training If she understands money give her a bag of quarters and tell her that she can keep all of the ones that are left at the end of the weekBUT if she pees in her pants she has to pay YOU two of the quarters you can up the price as the training continues Soon she will get the idea You will need to remind her to pee at least every hour or two so set the timer on the stove to buzz when it is time for her to go pee If she does give her a quarter for her bag Good luck A high specific gravity in a urine test means that your urine is very concentrated You may need to drink more water and other fluids He needs to see his medical provider so he can be properly examined and diagnosed Frequent urination could be related to a prostate problem a urinary infection or even diabetes This is an issue that only your urologist can or should answer Anytime that you see blood in the toilet it can only be from about two sources the urine or the bowels Since you recently had surgery for kidney stones you are likely to form more so another CT scan of the kidney may be in your future especially since you are in pain Even tiny kidneys stones can cause severe pain if they are lodge in the ureter so it would be best not to ignore these symptoms and consult your urologist If you cannot see your urologist quickly then an emergency room visit is appropriate They will most likely order an immediate CT scan of the kidney with your history and symptoms I have been there and done that stent and all so my heart goes out to you More concentrated urine in the bladder can be darker As long as your urine returned to a morenormal light yellow color after you drank more water there is no need to be concerned If this unusual episode just happened  then there is unlikely to be a serious problem going on You may have just been in a deep dream state and believed you were urinatingnot unlike someone who sleepwalks However if this has happened before or happens often you would want to see your medical provider Sudden bouts of urinating in your sleep or frequent urination could be an early sign of diabetes or a subtle urinary tract infection Frequency of urination and dysuria pain on urination are two signs of a urinary tract infection Another would be blood in the urine but since you are spotting this may not be noticed or obvious Since urinary tract infections can be caused by sexual activity and you have been trying to get pregnant I think it would be wise to have a urinalysis and a urine culture It may be a bit too early to see if you are pregnant You are not likely losing testosterone at 45 Based on what you have shared I see nothing troublesome about your recent sexual escapades Satisfied but weakenednothing wrong with that Keep it up so to speak Every man would benefit from a full physical examination at least every few years Have some diagnotic blood and urine tests get your prostate examined and even have a testosterone level if you would like I am not sure why your testicles are hot when your urinate not common but this should be mentioned to your medical provider This may be a sign of infection perhaps an STD I would suggest that you see a medical professional so that you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated Neither Intense urinary burning Strong smell Frequent urination Yes that sounds like a problem to meThese are three common signs of a urinary tract infection Time to call your medical provider to order a urinalysis and culture You still could have an infection Prostatitis can cause a milky discharge but so can Chlamydia There are many causes that must be considered from a urinary tract infection rare in men to balanitis the red bloches See a medical provider so that you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated  things that cannot be accomplished over the Internet These may be tiny fissures or tears but this is just a blind guess since I cannot see it Fissures should heal in a week or so if you keep the area very clean and dry be careful when you towel dry it would be better to pat dry this area Use a topical antibiotic ointment and check the area periodically with a mirror to make sure it is not getting infected Make sure that your underwear is not irritating this sensitive area Wear more breathable cotton ones for now Should this area fail to heal or if you think it is getting worse you will need to see a medical provider Yes precum as you call it is basically semen and semen can contain sperm so there is small possibility my risktaking friend You really have no business putting this woman at risk for pregnancy or an STD by penetrating and all that jazz without using a condom No more unprotected sexual encounters No more sleepless nights worrying This can occur with men as they get older and the prostate may not totally seal up after urination is over It can also occur after prostate surgery or with a low grade infection that makes you think that urine is still there in the urethra I suggest that you see a urologist get a urine check to be sure there is no infection Good luck So obviously this is a while later and I hope that you have seen your doctor and had your urine checked for infetcion Chills associated with infections usually means a severe infection usually with buring blood in urine pain urgency to pee having to urinate very frequently weak stream etc My guess is from what you said it was just the environment or somehting else but each person is different and for one person may be severe symptoms others may have minimal symptoms of same infection It is not normal for ANYONE to go long periods of time without feeling the need to urinate People typically need to urinate about every 3 to 4 hours while awake During sleep the kidneys produce less urine I myself 51yearold female am one of those people who can find that I havent urinated in up to 38 hours and that is very unhealthy Ive suffered serious health problems as a result There are many causes of not feeling the need to urinate when urine is actually present in the bladder but if the lack of need is because no urine is being produced that indicates kidney failure which will result in death if not immediately treated When the cause is not kidney failure the lack of the urge to urinate can be caused by dehydration which causes a reduction in the amount of water the nephrons of the kidneys allow to leave them Another cause can be avoidant parauresis or shy bladder syndrome I have this where the person psychologically suppresses the urge because of being too shy to use public restrooms Yet another cause is neurogenic bladder but in the case of such problems damage to the spinal cord is present and itd be difficult not to be aware of the condition However local damage to the nerves in the bladder or urethra may result in loss of sensation there too The best thing to do is to make sure youre not dehydrated schedule bathroom breaks every several hours even if you do not feel the need and check with your gynecologist or a urologisturogynecologist In addition to those causes another possibility more rare if pain is present is Interstitial Cystitis a condition that causes the bladder to shrink and to become unable to hold much urine The best thing would be to seek a urologist They can run tests to determine what is going on That is a high protein count and my first thought is infection especially since I have chronic infections But see a specialist not only for a second opinion but because they know much more about urinary and testicular problems I am 51 years old and I only have my period like once every 6 months my Dr told me its premenopause and put me on medication for it You should see your Drit could be something else too Good Luck Teresa Be certain that after urination you wait long enough before leaving the toilet area to avoid some dripping This has nothing to do with masturbation And there is no normal amount of masturbation many young men in their early 20s masturbate daily This is not a problem in and of itself If you continue with urinary leakage you might want to see your health care provider Have you had a pelvic exam I had ovarian cyst that caused pain on my lower right side for over a year before I went to my gyno had surgery lost my ovary as well as the pain I would see a Dr if I were having hematuria andor pain the reason I cant get into the doctor is because I have no transportation My car broke down and I have no way to fix it as of right now Itll harm your bladder Sometimes it will give you an infection bladder that is when your bladder cant function well anymore One more think your urine is contain of toxins that came out from your body system thats why you need to flush it out Here is some information on that may help As you can see there can be many causes so your best course of action is to make an appointment and get checked out by your doctor The WebMD Answers Staff How much water are you drinking Its all about balancing intake and elimination Are you drinking at least 68 cups of water each day If not then thats probably why youre peeing it out sounds like a little bit of dehydrationelectrolyte imbalance thats why youre having stomach pain Sometimes water isnt enough Try Gatorade but small amounts because it has a lot of sugar in it I drank some and it worked like a charm  I know you said you live far from a doctor but you should try to go to one anyways just to be on the safe side Maybe somebody can drive you or you can take public transportation Best

yeast infection Or it could be a symptom of a STD or other more severe problem Automatically treating for a yeast infection can increase discomfort and hinder proper treatment options of some other infections Its best to have a swab test done to find out EXACTLY what infection you might have and get exactly the treatment you need you need to go back to the doctor some of those could be symptoms of the birth control u are not taking it correctly or you could have something more seriously i d say you need a pelvic exam done go see a dr Ive had a few yeast infections that caused that discomfort which usually results from scratching or rubbing too much down there when it itches Some of the yeast infection medications also include a little tube of cream that is there specifically for the relief of the discomfort you are experiencing it feels as if it is trying to pass my stone in the last 3  in my ureter when attempting to squeeze out the last amount of urine it hurt a bit and some blood came out Is this normal during the passing process if he has pain or a burning sensation when he tries to pee it could be a urinary infection I say call your doctor to get checked for a UTI Some UTIs just dont follow the rules no pain no fever and you think no way Better safe then sorry untreated UTIs can cause bad infections and possible damage Thank you for your feedback Ill be going to the

cause than certainly you get good news Rush to your doctor to checkout that your kidneys are ok or notTo stop catching uti oftenly do not use commode for urination and wash your privates just after urination If you have prolonged uti problem it may reach to your kidneys and damage them badly because the urinary track is shorter in females By no means am I an expert but you need to get a second opinion because that is not normal please help me i have not gone through menapause yes you can still take a pregnancy test the spotting could just be implantation blood which is very normal at the beginning of the pregnancy It could be the color of your urine or small amounts of blood from a urinary tract infection or if you are passing hard stool your bum could be bleeding a little Sound like urinary tract infection or bladder infection I would see a Dr if it last more than 1 day main concern is no appetite lips are blistering not drinking much plays for a few minutes and then just falls asleep very unusual for her I have to pee all the time to Started shortly after early onset menopause MY mohter had one of those slings put in That had to be removed So she just wears a pad and is cautious about her fluid intake when she has to go out for any reason I have never smelled her urine Also medicare medicaid are helping w the incontinence supplies Sounds like a UTI go see the Doc you need a gyno to tell you for sureUTIs can be dangerous please check it out soon while most people think it is selective to women only men can also get urinary tract infections UTI as well as bladder infections if this is the case either of which would explain all of your symptoms you need to see a physician and have a urine culture as well as a swab culture to confirm diagnoses an antibiotic will likely be prescribed and as always for kidney and bladder function 100 cranberry juice helps to maintain a healthy urinary system it could be herniyah yes but its unlikely to give to to him cause unlike women males have a very long track and its much harder for a man to get a uit i would say it safe to have sex  to be sure he doesnt get one since there is always a chance tell him to pee after and he shouldnt have any problem you also try to pee after sex if you have a uti and based on what you said you do try to drink as much water as you can cranberry juice is also known to help and try not to pee everytime you get the urge to cause this can make it worse and cause bleeding  you have very small viens in the walls of your track which can break when you strain like you do when you have a uit  also if you just got one try the water diet for a day or so if it doesnt get better go to the doctor and get meds be sure to take them all even if you done have the discomfort anymore  i myself have been able to stop a uti with alot of water and trying not to always pee giving my blatter a chance to bluid up pee before going  but this doesnt always work okay  hope this helps you most likely have a uti  the itching if from the bacteria nd the urge to pee alot is your bodies way of trying ot flush it out best bet is to drink as much water as you can try not to pee everytime you feel you have to caue this can make it worse and also cause bleeding due to the fact we have we have small viens in the walls of our tracks that can break under the stress of going to much and straining  i think if in a day or so things dont get better go to your doctor  also if they get worse while yout tying these things go to ur doctor  hope this helps feel better do you have pain in your sides cause its possible not for sure but possible you have a kidney stone blocking your pee  def go to a doctor if it last another day sounds to me like the mucus you have when your ovulating which is normal it should only last a few days  if your trying to get prego now would be the time  From personal experience this may or may not be the same thing youre dealing withI went to the dr for the same thing Apparently people have the Staph bacteria all over their body all the time and usually youre fine but sometimes the bacteria will get balsy or get into tiny openings in the skin and cause what feels like little cuts I was getting them inside my nose for not apparent reason and nothing gets rid of it and then it happened in the same place youre talking about I was prescribed Mupirocin and it went away in about 3 days It could be something simple such as a UTI but I would call your doctors office today since you are pregnant and spotting and inform them They may be able to squeeze you in earlier or just give some reassurance I am 42 years old What causes weak urine flow with residual urine cystitis Drinking lots of water is fine but too much is bad because it exerts pressure on the kidneys and over a period of time you may suffer some type of an ailment related to your kidneys Moreover the sodium levels may also get very low There may be a number of reasons that may be the reason behind the excessive thirst for water such as diabetes kidney or liver disease head injury burns or infections or even psychological disorders Please refer to an experienced doctor You may want to have the doctors check you for Gastroparesis Diabetics are more prone to get it but I just found out I have it and had it before I became type two diabetic It causes problems with the emptying of
