thorte if youre having trouble eating because of it Id recommend pedialite pops  theyre popsickles for kids that I think have vitamins and such in them Also if you can tolerate ensure it has proteins and calories that youre probably really needing to get better what it sounds like he is saying is that yes you have an infection BUT its hard to tell right away if its viral or bacterial Your doctor chose to try and treat a bacterial infection by giving you antibiotics Unfortunately for you it seems like it is viral which means you may not have needed antibiotics in the first place They wont hurt you to have had them but they didnt really help anything either Viral infections just take longer to get rid of  I just got over a really nasty viral infection myself Takes a while but hang in there Youre probably not even sick anymore  Sounds like exercise induced asthma Ive never had asthma in my life but after recovering from a cold I was exercising and had an asthma attack My doc prescribed a rescue inhaler for me and Ive been fine since Just be careful that its not something more serious like a heart attack But sounds like asthma Not 100 sure but that happened to me  my son  we both ended up having a high lead level and when i do a big sneeze i end up with a stuffy nose then but once i blow it it goes away its not like a 247 stuffy nose like u have when u get a coldwhat can help  An endocrinologist is usually the type physician used to coordinate the care of thyroid cancer Follicular thyroid cancer involves several different steps and an endocrinologist will be able to guide your treatment program so that at each stage you see the most appropriate consultant The first step in the treatment of suspected follicular thyroid cancer is a total or neartotal thyroidectomy This type of operation can be tricky and you want to make sure you are referred to a surgeon with a lot of experience in thyroid surgery Once the thyroid is removed the diagnosis of follicular thyroid cancer must be confirmed This type of thyroid cancer unlike the more common thyroid cancer papillary thyroid cancer cannot be accurately diagnosed by a fine needle aspiration This is the procedure when a doctor puts a needle into a thyroid nodule and draws out some cells Fine needle aspiration can only be used to diagnose a follicular tumor A follicular tumor may be either benign or cancerous A surgical specimen is required to determine that the tumor is cancerous and has the ability to spread to other sites When the diagnosis of follicular thyroid cancer is confirmed surgically and the thyroid has been removed the next step in the treatment is radioactive iodine I131 This is used to kill off any remaining thyroid cancer cells Once the thyroid has been removed and destroyed scans and blood tests can be used to check for recurrence After surgery and radioiodine ablation thyroid cancer patients are given thyroid hormone replacement to replace the hormone and prevent any thyroid growth An endocrinologist will be able to support you through this entire process Anaphylaxis develops rapidly within minutes to a few hours after exposure to a provoking trigger The quicker anaphylaxis develops usually the more severe the reaction Most cases of anaphylaxis are not life threatening but it can be fatal Anaphylaxis is a severe wholebody allergic reaction Chemicals are released from cells in the body when they are exposed to a trigger The trigger can be a variety of substances such as bee venom a medication or a food Anaphylaxis may begin with severe itching of the eyes or face and within minutes progress to more serious symptoms These symptoms may include difficulty breathing swallowing diarrhea hives abdominal pain and swelling underneath the skin angioedema Anaphylactic shock is the most severe form of anaphylaxis and causes low blood pressure and difficulty breathing The chemicals released as part of the allergic reaction cause blood vessels to dilate or swell Circulation and respiratory failure can occur The reaction may be fatal if emergency treatment is not given immediately Generally with treatment anaphylactic symptoms resolve However there can be a reoccurrence of symptoms that develops without another exposure to the trigger This second reaction has been reported to develop in up to 23 percent of initial anaphylactic episodes in adults The second reaction typically occurs within 8 to 10 hours after the initial symptoms have resolved although recurrences up to 72 hours later have been reported In extreme cases protracted anaphylaxis has occurred which lasts for hours days or even weeks Talk with your doctor about your symptoms and concerns Anaphylaxis is not always easily diagnosed because the symptoms are varied and can mimic other conditions Anaphylactic reactions typically occur when a trigger is reintroduced The body becomes sensitized to the trigger Since you have had reactions to medications and are restarting a medication you may want to take the first dose of the medication at your doctors office so that you can be monitored When it comes to anaphylaxis the smart thing to do is to be cautious and seek immediate attention Thank you SueBee14 I do take daily probiotics and a multivitamin To clarify I am generally a relatively healthy individual I have never been sick like this before though I have had bronchitis in the past I am not a smoker and I live a healthy active lifestyle Keep gargling with hot water with salt added You could also keep drinking lemon juice mixed to warm water and add honey insead of sugar You could have green tea with honey Keep having warm soup and water Take care This very well be the result of allergies that you may or may not be aware of causing thick drainage mucous from your sinuses When you lie down this process becomes worse and it continues to drain during the nite down the throat causing irritation in the form of a dry scratchy throat and even burning sensation in the same area It continues into the esophagus and into the stomach When you awake in the morning because you have not drunk any liquids to help thin and clear the mucous you feel as if you can not swallow AND you are most likely to feel nauseated as the mucous is now the only contents in your stomach Vomiting may very well make you feel better because it removes the contents that is making you feel nauseated However you do not want to have to go thru this process every morning It would be extremely irritating and even damaging to the esophagus and oral cavity If this is the problem he is likely to give you an allergy medicine such as Allegra Zyrtec or Claritin to take on a daily basis that will help clear the drainage stopping the irritation in the throat and halting the morning nauseavomiting Hope you feel better soon Not a doc but had similar situation and it caused scratchy throat with some very mild bleeding As blood has a coppery taste would stand to reason Took cough med OTC for dry cough to produce gunk Also could be serious BIG HOWEVER See doc to rule out any other infection or  Also have doc rule out any dental issues while heshe is giving you the one over Good luck Not a doc but strep usually presents with red swollen lymphs and while spots Have no idea what your daughter has but would take her to doc post haste  does she have any other symptoms  fever blurred vision redness or yellowing skin other enlarged lymph nodes in the body etc  if thats the case child should probably go immediately to emergency room The point may be argued concerning diet soda consumption and throat problems but what can be agreed upon is that folks really enjoy their soda Soda represents roughly 25 of all beverages consumed by Americans Bad teeth weight gain bone deterioration epilepsy multiple sclerosis diabetes chronic fatigue syndrome and other medical conditions have all been associated with the consumption of diet soda  Diet soda is very acidic and may cause throat irritation One study has even shown a possible relationship between drinking diet soda and developing esophageal cancer Other reports contest the accuracy of that study result Due to the popularity of diet soda the money generated from its sales and diet sodas possible links to abnormal medical conditions it is expected that health concerns will debated for some time to come Drinking alcohol may contribute to experiencing a sore throat Some of the many reasons that drinking alcohol may cause a sore throat include the following Doctors specializing in disorders of the Ears Nose and Throat ENT are called Inoperable squamous cell carcinoma tumors of the throat may respond positively to the following general treatments Chemo Therapy Radiation Therapy and medications directed in a targeted fashion to interfere with the tumors blood supply Finally the patient may consider becoming part of a clinical trial where new medications usually not yet approved to treat this type of cancer are provided with the hope of finding an effective treatment agent Infants and children have faster heart beats than adults Your 5 year old could not be more normal when it comes to having a heart rate of 95 beats per minute while resting According to the web site Normal Pulse Rate In Children the average heart beat range for children 3  5 years old is 80110 beats per minute  The average pulse rate for this age group is 95 beats per minute I would recommend calling the family doctor or pediatrician for advise on treating the sore throat and congestion I hope that your child feels better soon  Nocturnal paniclike choking episodes while sleeping can be extremely scary Sometimes these events seem to last for at least one minute before normal breathing activity is restored I bet that you feel like you probably will not resume breathing and die I am very aware of your symptoms but am confused by the breathing through a pin hole statement My experience has been that the airway is completely blocked If Gastro esophageal reflux and sleep apnea have been eliminated as the possible causes of your choking by a neurologist then a have several other conditions to consider as follows 1 Nocturnal panic attacks  It is thought that genetics may cause this type of attack Stress and other sleep disorders may also play a role with this condition Psychological counseling and medications may provide relief 2 Laryngospasm  Although not GERD there does seem to be a GERD relationship With Laryngospasm the individual wakes unable to speak or breathe See the laryngospasm article from WebMD by accessing the link below httpwwwwebmdcomheartburngerdguidelaryngospasmcausessymptomsandtreatments 3 Focal Seizures  This is my first choice of possible conditions that may be causing your choking The symptoms of focal seizures are similar to those that weve been discussing Sleep apnea may erroneously be cited as a clinical diagnosis when in actually a seizure disorder is the problem The scalp EEG does not conclusively reveal this type of seizure Therefore more sophisticated diagnostic testing may be necessary to rule in or out and seizure location focal seizure as the cause of your choking Do not give up on your quest to discover the cause of your choking Perhaps youll make the WebMD community familiar with your final diagnosis Restless legs is one issue Throad spasams are ususally caused by thorax problems YES it is usually yeast and can make your tongue very sore and sensitive and the back of your throat too take a look if you see it red or white ask your doctor for something for thrush and it will feel better in a few days Have you seen a pulminologist It sounds like coughvariant asthma My son has this form of asthma the asthma meds help control the coughing I forgot to mention my sons xrays are always clear and he rarely ever wheezes But he does have asthma I have seen improvements from being on different inhalers Although we are still trying to figure out how severe his case is since even prednisone doesnt fix the cough now For your any dental problem plz click here  confidentdentalcare  The primary approach to properly managing acid reflux should be to actively identify and avoid certain foods that trigger your symptoms Here are some of the common foods that can trigger acid reflux  Fatty foods  Acidic foods like citrus fruits or tomatoes and tomatocontaining products  Coffee caffeinated beverages or alcohol  Chocolate or peppermint  Spicy foods  Garlic or onions Also try to refrain from lying down after meals eating too much in one sitting eating less than two hours before going to bed or exercising or eating too quickly Quitting smoking and losing weight may also alleviate symptoms as well I would suggest journaling your dietary intake and activities each day so that you can notice any trends in what might be provoking your symptoms If you continue to experience acid reflux symptoms remedies might include over the counter products or prescription medication Certain alkaline foods may help to neutralize acid reflux too but its more important to prevent acid reflux from occurring in the first place by avoiding your triggers Consult with your doctor about long term treatmentmanagement options and visit the WebMD HeartburnGERD Health Center for more information httpwwwwebmdcomheartburngerddefaulthtm What did she eatShe may have an allergic reactionWhen she sleeps keep her head propped up so she dont risk the chance of choking A number of things could be causing this Everything from a hiatal hernia to esophageal cancer You need to see your doctor right away as this could be very serious Are you having any other symptoms Has a Doctor verified you have an ear infection  I had HORRIBLE pain in my ear I went through 5 courses of antibiotics before the decision was made that I should see a Specialist The problem was not in my ear the glands in my neck were blocked and were pressing against my ear I had a huge bulge under my jaw from the infection I had surgery at MD Anderson Hospital almost a year ago and all is fine So sorry to hear youre going through this I can think of few things worse than a sinus headache Your best bet is to make another trip to the doctor for a reevaluation of your symptoms It sounds like youre doing everything right in terms of taking your prescribed medications checking your shower for mold and mildew etc Since your symptoms have continued after finishing the antibiotics you were prescribed youd be welladvised to go back for further evaluation Your health care provider may want to try a different type of medication to help manage your symptoms In the meantime you can try taking overthecounter pain relievers as directed on the bottle This may help some with the pain Good luck to you Feel better soon Its hard to say So many illnesses begin with the symptoms you describe that guessing what you have would be folly Youll have to wait until things progress a bit further to really know whats going on That said you might consider calling your medical provider to let them know about this because the flu influenza can cause these symptoms If you are diagnosed with flu within 48 hours of onset you can be treated with an antiviral drug However a cold virus or even severe pollen allergies also could cause the symptoms you describe Like I said you might have to wait and see what develops Meanwhile drink plenty of fluids get some rest and take some overthecounter pain relievers if youre not allergic to them Wishing you well Im sorry to hear youre going through this It sounds very unpleasant A viral infection such as the common cold can last as long as 14 days though most people only experience symptoms for up to a week So its possible this is a virus On the other hand it could be a sinus infection Ive heard patients describe a crushing sensation with sinus infections No matter whats causing your symptoms I think after a week of suffering through them you deserve a diagnosis Id suggest visiting your primary care provider to see whats going on If its something that can be treated with antibiotics then youll get a prescription and should feel better within days after starting on the meds If you do receive a prescription for antibiotics be sure to take the entire course of pills Do not stop taking them just because you begin feeling better This is very important Youve done the right thing by trying to treat the symptoms with overthecounter products but obviously that hasnt helped I hope youll now seek medical attention Youve earned it All the best to you Honestly the only way to diagnose strep is through a lab test Even if all the signs like throat redness and symptoms like soreness are there it still may not be strep Even white spots in the back of the mouth are no guarantee its a case of strep is almost always accompanied by fever Are you using a thermometer to measure your sons temperature or are you relying on the old handtotheforehead method Its very important to use a thermometer when assessing fever I mention this because it never ceases to amaze me how many people do not have this basic tool in their medicine cabinets Keep in mind also if youre giving your son acetaminophen Tylenol to ease the pain of the sore throat this could cause him to register a normal temperature on the thermometer because acetaminophen is a feverreducer Instead of speculating about what might be going on with your son I suggest you take him to his pediatrician Since the problem has been going on for nearly a week its not a bad idea to get medical attention I hope your little boy feels better soon Wishing you well The type of pain you describe certainly is common after endoscopy and Im sorry youre experiencing it Generally speaking throat lozenges or any kind of hard candy sugarfree if you have diabetes can soothe the irritation of the throat after endoscopy You also may use an overthecounter pain reliever such as acetaminophen Tylenol ibuprofen Motrin Advil or naproxyn Aleve Keep in mind ibuprofen and naproxyn are blood thinners that can promote bleeding so you may want to avoid those for a few days after your endoscopy Also if you take acetaminophen be sure to follow the label instructions Taking too much acetaminophen can damage your liver Do not exceed the maximum daily dose Hope this helps Any time someone reports symptoms on just one side of the body unilaterally it raises a few red flags You could be describing something as simple as an inflamed lymph node or as complex as cancer Theres no way to tell without doing a physical examination I suggest you make an appointment with your primary health care provider to start with He or she will make an initial evaluation and diagnosis and then refer you to a specialist if necessary I dont want you to be alarmed about this Chances are these symptoms dont point to anything ominous But why not get checked out just to be safe Wishing you all the best That sounds very unpleasant Lets look at some reasons why you might be having these issues Because you and your girlfriend are having identical symptoms the cause could be environmental such as dry air pet dander dust perfumes from laundry detergent or dryer sheets and many other sources Its not uncommon for people to wake up with a dry scratchy throat after they begin using their furnace in the fall because heating the air makes it drier If you think this could be the cause try using a humidifier in the bedroom to relieve your symptoms If you or your girlfriend start to experience any of the following symptoms it would be best to see a health care provider as soon as possible Fever Vomiting or diarrhea Skin rash Dizziness or fainting Even if your symptoms arent caused by a virus or infection if youre feeling unwell its always OK to see a medical professional Hope this helps Its impossible to say what this might be without performing a physical examination unfortunately There are many structures such as and  in the area you mention These could become swollen and painful or it could be something else entirely If this swelling doesnt clear up within a few days or if you start to run a fever it would be worth getting this checked out by a doctor Any time there is swelling on one side of the body but not the other you cant go wrong getting it checked That said just because youre experiencing unilateral swelling doesnt mean its anything serious Lymph nodes for example often become enlarged in one small area on a temporary basis and then return to normal size I hope this helps Sorry youre dealing with this I definitely would have these new symptoms checked out There may be some causeeffect between the strep and the swollen painful joints or you may have developed something else entirely At any rate the sudden onset of the symptoms you describe in an otherwise healthy young female is reason enough to seek medical care right away Your best bet is to return to the urgent care facility where you received the strep test and injection because theyll have your medical records at hand Normally I wouldnt advise someone who believes they have strep throat to seek urgent care Its something that can be handled by a primary care provider Take care and best wishes Im sorry youre going through this I want to caution you however that you should never selfadminister antibiotics Its this type of usage that is causing a rise in the development of antibioticresistant bacteria Your best bet is to see a medical professional Your condition can only be diagnosed through a physical exam and possibly some other testing such as a throat swab or blood work It could as you speculate be a virus If it is it should clear up in 714 days No antibiotics required However it could be something other than a virus Many conditions can cause the symptoms youre describing from an inflamed salivary gland to an abscessed tooth The only way to find out is to visit a health care provider I wish you all the best Because you vomited after taking the  Id suggest you contact the health care provider who prescribed it to let them know This can signal an allergic reaction but it could also have happened simply because you were nervous about taking the antibiotic Let me reassure you that your doctor would not have prescribed azithromycin knowing you were pregnant unless he or she thought it was safe for you That said I would definitely suggest you get in touch with your doctor to discuss your concerns the vomiting and diarrhea and see if he or she can prescribe something else for you I also invite you to participate in  where you can connect with experts and other momstobe Wishing you and your baby all the best Sorry to hear youre going through this The source of your outbreak can only be determined with a physical examination and some tests Could you have an STD Yes Could you have strep Yes Could you have a yeast infection of the mouth Yes Is it possible your symptoms are unrelated to the unprotected sex Yes As you can see there are many possible causes for the symptoms you describe and only testing can get to the cause I suggest you not delay You can start by calling your health care provider for an appointment but if they cant get you in within a week or so then you might consider urgent care By the way you should notify your sex partner about these symptoms because you may have passed them along to him or her instead of the other way around And please in the future practice safe sex Even if your oral problem turns out not to be sexually related you can see how its possible to pick up STDs of the mouth by practicing unsafe sex Dont risk it Wishing you well Oh ouch Thrush is a painful condition so you have my sympathy Im assuming you were given a prescription rinse to clear up the infection Meanwhile Id recommend you eat things that are soft and cold Thick liquids like yogurt or an ice cream shake will probably go down well as will gelatin I would avoid anything salty or brittle like crackers certain cereals etc These items not only will hurt going down but can cause micro tears in the delicate tissues of the throat The good news is the antifungal mouth rinse should clear up the bout of thrush in no time Take care Im sorry to hear youre going through this and hope you get treatment so you get off the meth for good What a wonderful holiday gift that would be to yourself and your loved ones A overdose can cause serious medical problems that linger for a long time Because methamphetamine overdose can cause abnormally high blood pressure its possible for a person to suffer a major or minor stroke kidney problems and heart dysrythmias The effects of any of these things can linger for some time And I barely scratched the surface in terms of the damage a methamphetamine overdose can do to a body If you did not receive medical treatment for your meth overdose I strongly suggest you seek medical attention now A physical exam can help identify if your overdose caused any permanent medical problems I wish you peace Good for you for persevering Navigating the health care system can be daunting but you are hanging in there until you get some answers Obviously I cant diagnose whats going on with you and frankly wouldnt hazard a guess at this point Its possible all of your symptoms are related but its equally possible theyre all coincidental Or related to something else entirely Some conditions literally take years to reveal themselves enough for diagnosis Some examples but I want to make clear I am NOT suggesting any of these apply to you lupus gastroparesis fibromyalgia This process could be what youre experiencing If all of your symptoms are related to a single disorder perhaps that disorder is manifesting itself very slowly By not giving up and continuing to seek care for your ailments you may be helping yourself down to the road to diagnosis I wish you all the best in finding out what is causing these perplexing problems Id say so It may be something minor like dryness due to furnace season being upon us or postnasal drip but since the symptoms are bugging you and arent responding to overthecounter OTC remedies you wont lose anything by seeing the doctor It could be you have a sinus infection or something else thats treatable And then you wont be uncomfortable anymore Best wishes to you Good question At least it sounds like youve been able to isolate the condition as occurring only in your own house Thats a start in trying to figure out whats going on A couple of possibilities spring to mind First is dry air Lack of humidity can cause all the symptoms you describe and is common in regions where people run the furnace in the winter At the other end of the spectrum is mold Im not necessarily talking about toxic black mold but rather the more common mold and mildew that occur in humid climates If your house feels dank or if you see mold growing beneath the kitchen sink or in other areas that could be the source of your symptoms How about allergies Are you allergic to cats Did the previous tenant of your house own one or more cats If so you could be having an allergic reaction to the cats that used to inhabit your house Other allergies could be at the root of this anything from grass or plants maybe theres some particular tree or bush growing outside your window that gives you an allergic reaction to formaldehyde in the carpeting If you can find an environmental cause such as dry air or mold you can take steps to mitigate the problem Either humidify the air or get rid of the mold If this is some sort of allergic reaction it may be much harder to pinpoint the cause In that case your only option may be to move out of the house Sorry youve been suffering and hope you can figure out the root cause soon Your story illustrates why its so important to give a complete medical history to your health care provider on each visit Im wondering if the person who prescribed the penicillin knew you had just gotten over a bout of  If so then I would assume its OK to take the penicillin If not then I would suggest you call the prescribing physician tell them about your bout with colitis and ask about the penicillin treatment In the case of  antibiotics usually are given to shorten the period of time during which youre contagious Antibiotics also helps prevent the spread of strep to other parts of the body There are many different strains of Streptococcus bacteria some of them are more dangerous than others As I said your best bet is to ask the prescribing physician about taking penicillin after recovering from a recent bout of colitis That way you will have a positive answer to your question Take care Providing you dont have a fever it sounds like youre describing a or the flu If you do have a fever or if youre experiencing chest congestion fluid in your lungs that causes coughing and shortness of breath youd do well to seek medical attention to make sure you dont have something more serious As long as youre not coughing up blood from your lungs you probably dont need to worry Its not unusual to cough up bloodtinged sputum from the back of the throat If your symptoms remain mild and confined to simply nasal drainage sore throat and sneezing you may find some relief from overthecounter cold remedies They wont make the cold go away but they may relieve the annoying symptoms The pharmacist can help you choose a product and instruct you on its proper use If your symptoms turn severe and you begin to run a fever then its definitely time to get checked out by a health care provider He or she can diagnose and treat your illness if its something more than a cold or the flu Dont forget to drink plenty of fluids This will help keep the mucus thin which makes it easier to eliminate by coughing or blowing your nose Feel better You were wise to get this situation checked out because it is possible for a person to leak cerebrospinal fluid CSF through a nostril and this is a dangerous situation that can lead to a serious infection of the membranes that surround the brain However since youve had a battery of tests done that have shown the fluid leaking from your nose is not CSF then you can rest assured your brain is fine The fluid coming from your nose must be normal  Many people myself included suffer from a chronically runny nose Clear fluid coming from the nose can indeed be caused by allergies There also is an interesting condition called gustatory rhinitis which is fancy talk for getting a runny nose while eating Since your runny nose comes and goes it does sound like it could be seasonal allergies Only your health care providers can solve this mystery for you I wish you all the best I know you believe the problem is sinus drainage but has anyone evaluated you for acid reflux I mention this because people especially those with sinus problems often believe they are constantly coughing up nasal drainage when actually theyre coughing up stomach acid You can test this theory yourself by taking an overthecounter antacid for a few days to see if it helps the problem A lot of people arent aware stomach acid can move all the way up the esophagus into the posterior portion of the mouth especially when sleeping Sometimes acid reflux is actually diagnosed by a dentist who notices substantial erosion of the molars caused by stomach acid If the antacid helps or if you can correlate a pattern of phlegm with food intake you might take up the acid reflux idea with your health care provider during your next visit Wishing you well The passage way from your nostrils is connected with your throat This is why when you laugh and drink milk at the same time it comes out of your nose When you force air pressure through your nose to blow the mucus out it also can come out of your mouth Call Your Dr Immediately or go to the Emergency room That is just what I would do it could be your thyroid I would go to a walkin clinic to get it checked out No It does not Sometimes the infection can become systemic immediately if the scratch is deep enough And if you washed it properly you may have disinfected the skincapillary area You should keep tabs on your temperature just in case A systemic reaction can sometimes cause your temperature to go way up If it goes above 104 call a doctor Sounds more like allergy symptoms If you are shaking and having a headache along with your sore throat you need to see a doctor to look at you immediately Most sore throats are caused by infections but some infections are more serious than others A doctor can test your throat to see if you have strep throat or something serious Go to the doctor right away Keep your throat moist and drink plenty of fluids specifically those that will not dehydrate you less or no caffeine If you have regular issues with allergies partner with your pharmacist and physician to make sure it is right for you concerning the timing or current trimester of your pregnancy Penicillin can be harsh on the stomach It is important to take it with food and not on an empty stomach Your pharmacist may also be able to flavor the medication to make it easier for your son to take I would make sure the vomiting has subsided before giving him another dose Since I dont know the original diagnosis or the reason for his penicillin prescription I wouldnt know if the condition is causing the vomiting or the medication Let his stomach settle a bit and try giving him something small to eat something that will be light on his stomach See if he can hold this down before giving him another dose of medication If the vomiting continues consult your health care provider to discuss an option that may be less upsetting to his stomach Hello There My jaw hurt as well as my throat on the left side but the pain soon subsided breifly That Thursday there was hardly any pain but around 9 pm there was so much pressure on my jaw that I walked into my house with tears rolling down my face I tried a warm bath submerging my face and ears in the water because my ears felt like they were bleeding and being jabbed with needles as they did when I went to the nurse the first time I tried to gargle salt water drink hot drinks cold drinks ice heat pads alternating Tylenol and ibuprofen nothing was helping Friday morning I woke my mom up still crying because of the terrible pain and she took me to a Family Clinic I couldnt open my mouth enough for them to look inside but they did look in my ear and said it was fine that it was pain from my throat They gave me a shot of penicillin and 12 Tylenol 3 Ive been taking the Tylenol 3 every 5 hours as prescribed and the pain never lets up I dont think the penicillin hasnt kicked in and it has been over 24 hours My jaw is still causing me a lot of pain and I still cannot open my mouth PLEASE HELP ME I went to doctor today for the same thing and was told it is a cist at the top of the thyroid and if it gets large it will need to be removed Could be som thyroid problems especially if your throat is sore or you feel like youre choking Should bring to your physicians attention Should get checked out further could be an array of symptoms CALL HER DR Call and ask your Dr your still in your 1st trimester so i wouldnt chance anything Those arent relevant symptoms and 11 days is too soon for a diagnosis of that condition I cant imagine a nonsmoker enjoying kissing a smoker Might as well kiss a filthy ash tray Hi This sounds very unusual and if I was you I would either go to your doctor or visit your local hospital As a followup my thyroid tests have all come back find Im scheduled to visit an endocrinologist in two weeks and think that maybe another hormone imbalance may be to blame for all of my symptoms which include  Hair loss all over for about ten years but mostly on the top of my head said to be female pattern baldness which I dont buy Migraines have had for twenty years Knee pain in my right knee MRI shows nothing was told Im just chubby and getting older A fleshyfeeling lump in my throat barium test showed nothing Several yeast infections in the past year plus a UTI Blurred vision at times Trouble concentrating Trouble losing weight I went from doing nothing to exercising five hours a week and lost only 3 pounds in six weeks Anxiety attacks worse recently but have had them for about 10 years More recently in the past couple of weeks Ive been now noticing  Itchy skin mostly at night in the scalp back feet arms legs and groin pretty unbearable Heart palpitations Hand tremors Lightheadednessdizziness mostly after standing but not always Ive had so many tests but the only hormone tests Ive had are for my thyroid all of which came back normal Im a 35yearold woman and have had one pregnancy and hope to have another one once I figure this all out These things are really consuming my life and I really feel as though the doctors are trying to play everything off as coincidence but I just know theres something wrong If anyone has any advice or ideas on what might be going on I would greatly appreciate the comments Im just at the end of my rope and dont know where to go from here if the endocrinologist doesnt find anything Please help Jackie it could be the left tonsilLook at it with a flashlight by looking at the throat If you see anything white white dots they need to see a doctor That is usually a sign of Strep Throat which can be extremely dangerous if not treated right away with antibiotics If the tonsil looks healthy then it could also be a lymph node Sometimes rapid strep tests are not 100 accurate however Ive never heard of a false positive on them just false negatives The only other way to confirm the results of a rapid test is to have a throat culture sent to a lab and tested The results from that usually take 3 days How long have you been on the antibiotics for If you have finished them you should go back to the doctor since they didnt help When you say almost every time does that mean all day and night Is this problem related to eating I have the same issue after I eat which I believe is a food allergy issue If yours is not synched with eating food it could be related to environmental allergies however its hard to say without more information Thats just an idea It sounds like Mono or Epstien Bar Virus They can cause each other thogh because I had both in Summer 2012 and I still got the swollen lympnodes If you get these from Mono they can last up to a yearnot suppose to but I do and to tell you the truth I think I am getting it again but a whole lot worse Mono can lead to Lymphoma same symptoms as Mono and I know that because my ex did and well I know I got Lymphoma or Mono again but anyways if you got Mono there is no treatment for it the only thing you can do is get a lot of rest and take some over the counter pain pills and you cannot do hardly any physical activity because when you have Mono your spleen gets swollen and if you fall you could rupture your spleen and the result for that is Hospital for a while Mononucleosis Symptoms Pain or discomfort Enlarged or swollen glands Fever Excessive sweating Night sweats Skin rash Sore throat Yellow skin Yellow eyes Decreased appetite Fatigue Headache Tenderness to touch Weakness generalized

my understanding and I am NOT a doctor or anything close that there is a lot of bacteria in your mouth Some people due to cultural social or bacterial reasons will have different types of bacteria in their mouth as you ones that youve never encountered before So when you kiss you probably french kiss and when you do you exchange those germs in turn effect your throat and give you a bacterial infection Cavities plaque on your teeth are all caused by bacteria eating and growing on the food particles left in your mouth after you eat POSSIBLE SOLUTION You can try using mouthwash afterwards and try to kill the bacteria that enter your own mouth or if your close enough to your partner both use mouth wash before making out If you live with them you can try to convince them the increase their oral hygiene In theory youll eventually build up an immunity to his standard regime of germs in his mouth Youre probably as sensitive as I am this used to happen to me all the time with a previous partner but since Ive become older I dont have the problembut my current partner is better at oral hygiene Also you can talk to your doctor about things that you can do to prevent this Obviously no longer kissing is going to be a solution but I doubt that will happen If it becomes a serious issue and it doesnt go away within 3 days go to a doctor and tell them the possible origin As some one else pointed out there are also STIs that can cause oral infections ones that are transferred from genitals tofrom your mouththroat If youre getting seriously sick you need to consider that possibility that they need to be checked out He may be a carrier or host But that needs to be discussed with a doctor as well This is a great question But Id like to ask this patient if theyre taking their medicine every day Some allergy medicines need to be in the body consistently so therefore theres a level of the antihistamine in your system and therefore you dont feel the symptoms of whats going on So if the patient isnt taking this medication every day theyre not gonna have the benefit from it And if Allegra isnt working its okay because one of the things that were finding out is that people differ when it comes to medications I may take a tablet and youre gonna take a tablet were gonna have a different reaction to it and some therapies might have to be adjusted and there are other medications available as prescription for allergy symptoms If the physician or healthcare provider decides that maybe they wanna try an overthecounter Claritin or Zyrtec would be probable you know products that could be chosen So let me get this straight you want to give a 3yearold child adult cold medicine The answer is absolutely not and when I looked at the package it clearly states to not give to children under 12 It is very important to understand that children are not little adults and you have to be very careful when it comes to medication and read the package Have you tried running a vaporizer At this point you can also use some Vicks Baby Rub but that is all that I would recommend until he can be evaluated and seen by a health care provider My son is 7 and has had a stuffy noise and a bad caugh for a monthCan I give him a 300mgClindamycin If the chunks are coming from your tonsils you have a persistent sore throat and fever then you probably should have your tonsils

of strep throat are throat pain fever over 101 degrees F white or yellow spots in the back of the throat and enlarged lymph nodes in the neck area If you have symptoms like these it would be best to see a doctor for evaluation If strep throat is diagnosed it is treated with antibiotics Sore throats that are caused by viruses are not usually treated with antibiotics Here is a link to an article about strep throat with more info httpwwwwebmdcomoralhealthtcstrepthroattopicoverview Take care I had that several years ago My lymph nodes were infected had to have a biospy to find out what it was

does mention that body temerpature can be a factor You should go ahead and see your dentist who can examine the area and evaluate whether an intervention is needed The answer is no strep is caused bacteria called streptococcus and without medication it can lead to more serious problems such as rheumatic fever and heart problems Although some people are strep carriers and show no signs or symptoms People who are experiencing signs of symptoms should be treated accordingly by a physician Signs could include feverheadache body chills and or a sore throat Most often it is easier to tell when a sore throat is from the influenza or do to a cold Strep most often isnt accompanied by coughing or a runny nose The loosing your voice could be from your sinus I have the same problem ween yourself off the inhaler That cold that was going around hit hard and lasted awhile You will be fine soon While there are no drug interactions between Adderall XR and Nyquil I would not recommend Nyquil for a sore throat Nyquil contains 4 medications including medications for symptoms you do not seem to have Always ask your pharmacist to recommend the best overthecounter medication for your symptoms It really would depend on the seizure medication Acetaminophen does not generally interact with any seizure medication But without knowing specifically what medications you are referring to I could not give you a definitive answer You should talk to your pharmacist who knows what prescription medications you use and can recommend an appropriate overthecounter pain reliever Most cough drops do not contain any medication just ingredients that help to soothe a sore throat and quiet a cough from a dry scratchy throat So they are fine to use while pregnant When purchasing the cough drop just show it to your pharmacist to be sure it is one that is safe for you while pregnant because there are many different types of cough drops available Yes It is safe to combine Tylenol with amoxicillin I suggest you speak with your pharmacist first who can help you choose the best product and tell you how much Tylenol to give your child based on how much your child weighs Could it be allergies It

say if you get these see your doctor I dont think you want to do that do you Hopefully if you come off it things should get better Good Luck your allergies maybe got something to do w it mainly because it has a triggering factor before you experience it as you said especially when taking dairy products what you experience is that when you take certain food or anything that triggers your allergic reaction is that your throat lining starts to swell thus decreasing your airway and making you feel that somethings blocking your throat to verify if its allergic response that causes that feeling whenever you experience it try taking any antihistamines but make sure to take nondrowse or take it when you are not working because it will make you feel drowsy if you have a sinus infection youre gonna need antibiotics unless its a fungal sinus infection then you will need an anti fungal medication but it could also be sinusitis in that case its inflammation from allergies or a viral infection you should go see a doctor about it if he thinks you have a sinus infection hes gonna give you the antibiotics or anti fungal prescription but if its just sinusitis he will probably give you an antihistamine or possibly antiviral medication depending on what kind of sinusitis it is the worst case scenario is probably fungal I am not a doctor i just picked up a little bit of information about this so do not hang on what i tell you see a professional I have gotten thrush from taking antibiotics Mouth and throat got so tender I couldnt eat My MD prescribed a syrup that cleared it right up 4 at the pharmacy He called it in Thrush will give you a white cotton mouth Also either Crest or Colgate makes a probotic mouthwah that will help But it burns when you first start using it CONGRATS ON THE BABI Is this Possible Been where you are did that too Talk with your family doctor about a chronic viral bronchitis He or she may prescribe a course of antibiotics possibly followed by a short course of Predizone to reduce the background of upper respiratory irritation and inflammation which has built up Note though technically trained and a patient advocate for people with chronic face pain I am not a physician Red Lawhern PhD Strep happens The fact that you have never caught it before is just sheer luck and of course your good immune system Strep is usually easy to treat once it has been properly diagnosed You most likely got in from one of your kids but strep is really everywhere Most of the time adults will fight it off but sometimes your number is just up Take your medication and consider getting a repeat culture at the end for proof of cure Strep cannot be accurately diagnosed by the severity of the sore throat  it requires both a handson medical examination and a lab test for confirmation Medical providers who feel they can just look in the throat and accurately diagnose strep tend to be wrong half of the time not much better than a coin toss There are some suspicious signs of strep that one can notice by simply looking at the throat Many people get all excited when they see white stuff on the tonsils This is not a definite sign of strep and can even be food particles Strep tends to cause petechiae  tiny irregularlyshaped red dots appearing on the back of the palate and on or near the uvula The back of the throat and palate area is usually an angrylooking fireengine red The kids look and act sick Their breath smells like they have never used a toothbrush in their life For those clinicians who have spent their careers insulted by this strep smell we usually have a pretty good idea that this child probably has strep I still test them If the rapid strep test is surprisingly negative it is not 100 I tend to get a throat culture A culture takes two days but the accuracy approaches 100 percent Streptococcal infections have a bad historical reputation since it has the potential to cause heartdamaging rheumatic fever kidney disease lifethreatening pneumonia and other serious complications The reason why we treat strep when we diagnosis is to prevent these complications that are relatively rare now If you have a good immune system our bodies can easily overcome an occasional attack of strep Kids who are excluded from school with strep should have at least 24 hours of treatment and show improvement before returning to school Treatment with antibiotics usually a penicillinbased one if you are not allergic to them will last about 10 days There is really no need to keep children home that long I always recommend that they change their toothbrush after a day of treatment since strep can colonize on wet toothbrushes If you have several kids who keep their toothbrushes in the same drawer touching it is the same as sharing toothbrushes For the teenagers I warn them about taking a clandestine swig out of the milk or orange juice container in the refrigerator when no one is watching If a sore throat persists more than a week or so accompanied by fatigue a mono test should be considered Yes We tend to get reexposed to various types of Strep throughout our lives What you are experiencing now as an adult would have nothing to do with your negative test as an infant Yes Strep B as well as several other bacterial Strep is not a virus types can grow out of a urine culture when you have an urinary tract infection but this was not lingering on since birth Strep throat is due to Group A Strep  a different bug entirely Unfortunately I have no way of seeing those red stripes over the Internet to offer you a patientspecific answer If you are concerned you will need to have a medical professional examine you firsthandnot something that I can accomplish in this forum Sore throat and ear pain are all reasons to seek medical care As much as I would like to help you no one can be blindly examined and diagnosed over the Internet You have had this problem for 6 months At what point to you think it would be a good idea to seek proper medical care There can be hundreds of reasons to account for your symptoms and it is your responsibility  as trustee of your body  to take care of it The only way that you can get to the bottom of these symptoms is to SEE a good medical provider  one who can take a thorough medical history perhaps run a few diagnostic tests NOSwimming exposure to water or going outside is not going to make your sick Most sore throats are not Strep and unless your Strep throat was confirmed by a lab test we may not be sure that you even had it If you did it can come back I dont know what you took for treatment You may need to have a throat culture to determine the organism causing your symptoms but many will be viral I do not know your age but mono can cause a severe sore throat and mimic Strep so if this is a concern your medical provider should also test you for mono I have no way of blindly diagnosing the cause of your sore throat over the Internetthis is going to take a handson examination and perhaps a Strep test Because you are pregnant you MUST be carefully examined and treated with medications that are safe for you and your baby This may be just a bad cold but you will need to see your medical provider to make sure you do not have something more serious going on I cant view your image but I have seen plenty of tonsil stones and ugly tonsils in my career so I dont think it is necessary for me to see your throat but it is necessary for an ENT to see your throat if you feel you are in need to a tonsillectomy Tonsil stones tonsilliths alone rarely qualify for a tonsillectomy although this would certainly cure the stone problem Insurance companies will typically approve a tonsillectomy if recommended by an ENT for such reasons as recurrent Strep infections Strep carrier state peritonsillar abscess sleep apnea or tonsils so enlarged that are obstructing the airway or your ability to swallow You cant just go in and ask for a tonsillectomy and get one Assuming she was diagnosed accurately by a lab test and given the appropriate medication Strep should be improving in a few days She hasnt be on the medication very long The antibiotic is really given to prevent Strep complications not to help the pain so hopefully you are giving something for the discomfort If the Strep was not accurately diagnosed her doctor should consider a viral infection such as mono as a possibility If the test was not Strep then it was most likely viral One virus in particular tends to last longer than the typical weekthat is the EBV virus the virus that causes mononucleosis As you know I have no way of examining your throat over the Internet but I would strongly suggest that you have your medical provider order an EBV panel a mono test I have no idea how long your throat will be sore since healing and recovery is very individual If you do have mono it could be weeks before you are feeling better As much as I would like to help you you cannot be blindly diagnosed over the Internet by providing a list of vague symptoms While I am sympathetic to your lack of insurance and financial constraints the ONLY way that you can get to the bottom of this four year old mystery is to see a medical professional  one who will perform a thorough medical examination and order some diagnostic lab tests Sorry First and most important How do you know those bumps in the back of the throat are HPV Have they been properly tested biopsied Pharyngeal HPV is not that common and should be aggressively treated Second HPV is transmittable from one mucous membrane mouth rectum penis vagina to another Even skin to skin contact can transmit HPV The most common cause of sore throat is a virus and most will last about a week unless of course you are developing a particularly nasty viral infection called mononucleosis mono If your sore throat does not resolve in a week your doctor should consider ordering a mono test EBV panel Hopefully you had a culture done takes 23 days since rapid Strep tests are not 100 accurate As far as what to do about your extreme pain I am at a loss since I really have no way of seeing your throat or review your medical history Gargling with warm saline 14 tsp of table salt with 8 oz of warm water can help Ibuprofen can help Again it is not typical to have extreme pain with a simple viral sore throat so you may need to be reexamined They may be tonsilliths tiny accumulations of food and other debris that get trapped in the cryptsholes in your tonsils and the surrounding tissue They tend to smell andor taste nasty since the warm moist environment of the throat causes this material to decompose This is just a guess however since I have no way of examining you ANY powder can cause respiratory difficulties in children This is why many pediatricians no longer recommend them The recommended diaper treatments are ointments and lotionsnot powders If you do use it be VERY CAREFUL not to cause a cloud of powder that you or your baby will inhale You can hock it up and spit it out assuming you are man since women seem to have a nearuniversal objection to doing this You can melt it down and reduce the mucous viscosity by hydration drinking lots of water saline nasal sprays or increased humidity humidifier vaporizer or hot showers Medication wise you can take a decongestant during the day not a night such as Sudafed a mucolytic mucousthinning medication such as Mucinex An antihistamine at bedtime can temporarily dry of the river of mucous so you can sleep better This is assuming however that you are medically able to take these types of drugs Sleep with your head elevated and hang in there Assuming you do not have a sinus INFECTION this should clear up in less than a week Viruses only last a week but it is possible to get backtoback viral infections that seem to last longer One virus mononucleosis can cause a very prolonged sore throat fatigue and white spots on the throat so if this is a possibility your medical provider should order a mono test EBV panel Another possibility could be sinusitis where the constant drainage is causing you to have a sore throat It is really up to you how you utilize your financial resources but the only way that you can be properly diagnosed is to be seen by a medical professional that can examine you and order a few diagnostic tests Stop freaking out The chance of you getting an amoebic infection from shower water in your nose would be highly highly unlikelyunless you are showering with contaminated untreated water Remember this is the same water you drink and use to brush your teeth The medical provider is quite skilled at smelling tobacco on your breath but there will not likely be any telltale signs of your smoking from just looking at your tonsils You are more prone to tonsillitis and other upper respiratory infections BECAUSE you are a smoker Dont be a fool my young friend When you start smoking young you are more likely to start having serious consequences at a younger age so dont be surprised in the future when a doctor tells you that you have cancer or some type of other serious cigaretterelated illness STOP NOWnot because it is illegal but because only stupid people and people who do not plan on living a long and healthy life smoke You will need to see your medical provider or better yet an ENT specialist  someone that his the expertise and tools to directly visualize your throat to see and hopefully retrieve this piece of foil if it is there Sometimes it just feels like we have a foreign body when we do not An neck xray should also reveal a metallic foreign object This is likely your epiglottis  Many things can cause a sore throat so dont just assume it is the Advair This is not a common sideeffect but it is possible If you were excessively kissing this could have dried out your throat which could make it temporarily sore but I would have no idea how long this would last Kissing shares germs like viruses and bacteria so this too can be another possible cause Sharing germs is really unavoidable with mouthtomouth contact so I suspect you will just take the risk Yes And have a throat CULTURE not a rapid Strep test The culture is more accurate Many times a failure of azithromycin is because it was incorrect prescribed Instead of the standard Zpack dose of two pills the first day and then one pill per day for the next four days Strep should be treated at a higher dose Two pills per day for the entire five days Noit is not an antibiotic that is effective for Step Since most sore throats are viral antibiotics are usually NOT needed It is wise not to selftreat Absolutely A cold is a viral infection and a fever is just one of the ways the body fights this infection A fever can also be a sign of a secondary bacterial infection so if you are not improving or getting sicker it would be best to see your medical provider You will need to see your medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated There can be many different reasons to account for your array of symptoms but unfortunately it would not be possible to narrow them down blindly over the Internet I have no way of blindly diagnosing the reason or significance of your cough over the Internet so I would suggest that you see a medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated Your drowning sensation may be due to fluid or mucous in your lower respiratory tract or even pneumonia so it would be wise to get it checked out today Having Strep a bacteria will not effect the effacacy of the influenza viral vaccine I dont know your sons age but he should not need to be revaccinated Talk to his doctor No one can be adequately diagnosed over the Internet based solely on a description You will need to be examined by a medical provider since there can be sooooo many reasons It is possible that not all of your symptoms are connected a person can have more than one medical issue at the same time You may need a Strep test for your throator even a test for mononucleosis but a medical provider would need to make that decision based on your examination findings Most throat infections or throat pain is caused by viruses Viruses do not respond at all to antibiotics The only way a medical clinician would recommend azithromycin for a throat infection would be for a penicillinallergic person who has labdocumented Strep and does NOT have mononucleosis I do not recommend selfdiagnosis and selftreatment using leftover antibiotics or antibiotics there are prescribed for someone else when it comes to managing a throat infection Ear drops instilled in the ear canal can go through patent open surgical tubes go down the Eustachian tubes to the back of the throat Those drops would then have to travel upwards unless she is lying down at the time and go UP to the nose and travel UP the nasolacrimal duct to get to her high This is really an unlikely journey Is it possible the drops are draining out of her ear canal into her eye or a finger goes into her wet ear and accidentally rubs her eyes a few moments later As you know I have no way of seeing your throat taking a more detailed medical history or examining you over the Internet I can make a blind guess but a guess is NOT the same as a diagnostic opinion  one that can only be accomplished by seeing a medical professional or ENT specialist You may want to look up tonsilliths tonsil stones These are common accumulations of food and other debris that can get trapped in or around the tonsillar areas Again dont diagnose yourselfsee a medical professional for these matters Fever is the bodys response to inflammation or infection Amoxicillin is only effective for a BACTERIAL infection like Strep It is absolutely no effect on viruses A person can contract a virus anytime even while taking an antibiotic Fever doesnt really shock or bother medical professionals as much as it does parents but I cannot blindly tell you the significance of this brief transient fever I do not know anything about your son what you really mean by a spike so when in doubt call his medical provider  someone who knows him his particular case and someone that can offer you the patientspecific advice that you really need Keep in mind that not all of your symptoms need to be linked to one universal cause Fatigue sore throat for a month Think mononucleosis Your doctor can order a sensitive EBV panel not the lesssensitive mono spot test Lump in breast in a 17 year old male I assume This is most likely adolescent gynecomastia You can look this up on the Internet This is quite common and related to hormones but it may NOT go away in a few months It can last longer An ER doctor has the equipment and mostlikely the skill to locate an remove a fish bone I am not sure your primary care doctor is equallyequipped and skilled and may send you to an ENT specialist These tiny bones can be unbelievably annoying so it is your choice to wait or not All the doctor needs to do is just look in your mouththe tonsils are easily visible A decision to do a throat swab is really based on your medical history an the appearance of your throattonsils The endoscopy is unlikely to have a beneficial effect on thrush Thrush is a yeastfungal infection common in people like the elderly who are immunocompromised Thrush is best treated with the antifungal medication The medical provider who is treating you for Strep is not really doing it correctly If you do a brief search on treating Strep with azithromycin you will see that the standard Zpack is not sufficient Strep should be treated with two pills 500mg every day for five days twice the dose you have been given The purpose of any antibiotic in the treatment of labdiagnosed Strep I hope you had a confirmation test to prove you did indeed have Strep is to prevent complicationsNOT to treat the associated pain Antibitoics are not good pain medications so I would suggest that you take an appropriate dose of ibuprofen or have your medical provider prescribe something for you Sore throats can be caused by MANY thingsviral infections bacterial infections like Strep mono post nasal drainage from sinusitis breathing through your mouth when your nose is clogged cigarettes allergyLOTS of things Can it last two weeks You bet It is possible for me or any medical provider to be able to determine a specific cause or a treatment over the Internet No Insurance or financial constraint or not the ONLY way you can be properly diagnosed and treated is to SEE a medical provider I know medical care is pricey but so is gasoline car repairs plumbers and just about anything else Sometimes you just have to allocate some of your limited resources to YOURSELF You cannot be blindly diagnosed over the Internet based solely on a list of vague symptoms If you want to find out what is wrong with you you will need to see a medical provider so that you can be properly examined Shingles can have systemic whole body effects like fatigue headache malaiseetc but it would be uncommon for shingles to directly cause a sore throat nasal congestion and coughing My guess and it is only a guess is that your symptoms are coincidental There are no rules in medicine that state a person can only have one health issueproblem at time or that all current symptoms are related to just one cause Yes Fever is the bodys natural response to fighting off an infection An area of inflammation in the throat or nasopharynx can mimic a foreign body sensation but pieces of food or even a hard lump of mucous can do this as well You may not be able to see a source on a selfexamination but your medical provider may be able to answer this question by examining you No canker sores aphthous ulcers resolve on their own over time Lidocaine will not cure them but it takes away some of the discomfort during the natural healing process You can treat the pain with ibuprofen or acetaminophen He can gargle with some WEAK saline solution 14 tsp of salt with 8 oz of warm water The the throat pain is viral it will selfresolve in a few day to a week however if he could possibly have Strep he will need to see hisher medical provider to be properly examined diagnosed and treated Pharyngitis IS a sore throatthe word means inflammation of the pharynx throat There are hundreds of causes of vertigo and it would be impossible to determine the cause of yours over the Internet so you will need to address this separate symptom with your medical provider Are you having risky behavior Most definitely Do you have an STDHIV risk because of these two incidents Yes I think you know that Should you be STDHIV tested Yes Are the tests accurate The tests are good but tests are rarely 100 accurate This is why conscious prevention is really your only protection You are the only one who knowsfor sureof your sexual exposures You do NOT know 100 of the sexual exposure of your partners People lie about this all of the time Jake Sadly men in particular are know for their convincing ability for telling untruths You need to protect yourself YOU and you alone are in charge of your sexual activities Your partner has a shared responsibility but may not have the same moral compass as you Sex is enjoyablenature has provided this gift for us but sex is not worth risking your health sleepless nights of worry or even dying for Period We use a very accurate and easy URINE test for Chlamydia and gonorrhea called a DNA probe The urethral swab can still be used but the urine test is easier and less traumatic for the male patient A blood test can be used especially if testing for other STDs like HIV or syphilis In an adult it is not necessary to mount a fever response to Strep Some people do most people do not So you can still have Strepyou were certainly exposed assuming your son was correctly diagnosed Any chance you can get a Strep test Some clinicians will just treat symptomatic parental contacts but that would be totally up to the discretion of the clinician This is a do it yourself home procedure See a medical provider an ENT would be best or the ER if you have a lodged metal can tab in your throat One sided throat pain is more concerning than if you had both sides sore A concern would be a peritonsillar abscess Since I have not way of examining your throat or delve into your medical history by this forum I would suggest that you see your primary care medical provider and be reexamined There are more things that can cause a sore throat than just Strep one being mono a virus You need to be reexamined today if possible The word pharynx is the medical term for the throat  back of the throat Pharyngitis means inflammation of the throat which could encompass many different conditions from a viral sore throat to Strep and monoall can cause pharyngitis The most important information is the CAUSE of the pharyngitis Claritin is an antihistamine that may help a scratchy throat caused by allergy I dont know anything about you to know if YOU can take this type of medication so check with your medical provider if you have any medical problems where this drug would be contraindicated A lower than normal body temperature of 96 is just fine if you are room temperature it would be time to worry Slightly lower body temperatures is not uncommon in viral infectons perhaps the cause of your sore throat Many people have cold sores in their past history but do not remember or they went unnoticed as being something else Once you have antibodies for the herpes simplex virus it can reactivate at any time in your lifeforever Mono is an entirely different and unrelated virus Mono cannot cause herpes but if a person already has herpes antibodies exposure to an illness or getting an illness could trigger this reactivation response There can be many reasons for your symptoms so please see your medical provider so you can be properly examined and diagnosed She should be tested for mono Ask your medical provider to order an EBV panel  a very sensitive mono test Yes postnasal drainage from the sinuses can definitely leave a bad taste in your mouth mostly in the mornings after a night of dripping Allergies colds environmental irritants chronic or acute sinusitis can be involved Of course there can be dental reasons as well Make sure to stay will hydrated by drinking plenty of water If you have a cool mist humidifier use it at night for a while to see if it helps Moisturize your nose with saline nasal spray before going to bed If this helps great but if you are having any signs of infection you will need to see your medical provider for a proper examination In a laboratory Petri dish I am sure that the alcohol in the vodka would kill some or all of the bacteria but the throat is not a Petri dish There are many parts of the throat that vodka would not even touch These areas would rapidly recontaminate the nongargled areas so any partial benefit that you might achieve would be mitigated Most sore throats are viral infections that only last about a week In adults most will improve on day three or four if you do nothing at all I would much prefer that you gargle with saline a weak salt water solution than to take a chance at aspirating vodka into your lungs This can happen and it would not be pleasant When you take health advice from your friends it can either be good advice or bad In this case the advise was not wise I would not recommend that you gargle with vodka Smoking anything can cause a sore throat That would be difficult to accurately determine since some people can harbor Strep for YEARS I would assume that your son was more contagious within a day of his symptoms Strep can be passed on to others for about a day after an appropriate treatment has started Not all people are susceptible to getting Strep easily since our immune system does a good job fighting it off Your other children have just as much chance of getting it from someone else at school than from a sibling Make sure your son with the Strep does not share a drinkglass and change his toothbrush to a new one If the toothbrushes are thrown into a drawer where they can touch other toothbrushes this is a good way to pass it on Albuterol is a bronchodilator used typically for asthma and a reactive airway If the cause of your wifes cough is due to asthma or an allergic disorder then yes it may help Albuterol is not a cough suppressant however Knowing the CAUSE of the cough is always important when determining how to treat it A cough due to a cold very common is from postnasal drainage so the cough is beneficial since it helps clear the airway A cough due to allergies can be very irritation so an antihistamine may help Suppressing a cough is considered controversial but often helpful if the cough interferes with sleep A teaspoon or two of honey can help or if you are looking for an overthecounter suppressant one containing dextromethorophan DM is often helpful A cough can also be a sign of a lung infection so if any cough persists especially one that is accompanied by chest pain fever or productive of thick mucous should be carefully evaluated by a medical provider Have her drink lots of water and humidify the air she breathes a cool mist humidifierall of these things will help quiet a cough If you are a smoker or have other risk factors cancer of the throat is always a possibility but with a sore throat for only four days  one that is strep negative  the most likely culprit is a plain ol respiratory virus These viruses tend to last a week so hang in there a bit longer If your sore throat persists consider getting a blood test for mono andor see an ENT for an exam If you are a smoker STOP SMOKING Yes but it is not very common The tonsils are the huge reservoir for Strep  so once they are removed Strep is almost nonexistent Keep in mind however that your child still has a throat and the throat may always be susceptible to infection If you were properly diagnosed with influenza Tamiflu will not help any other viral infection know that this drug does not cure the flu or treat specific symptoms It briefly shortens the course of the flu and alleviates the severity Immediate or dramatic improvemenst in flusymptoms are usually not seen If you are still having a sore throat on day two of the flu then you can treat this symptom separately gargling with warm salt water taking ibuprofen for the paininflammation and drinking lots of fluids Throat lozenges can also help You should not be able to get Strep while on amoxicillin since this drug is used for Strep You can however get a VIRAL sore throat or even mono while taking antibiotics Lay off for a few days and I am sure your volume will return Most ejaculate is semen not sperm created in the prostate gland Twice a day can be a bit much for this overworked gland to recover If you are still having burning you will need to see your medical provider but as a man it is not very likely that you have a UTIbut you could have prostatitis This is just a guess however since making that call requires an examination Your cold has nothing to do with this issue Do I have the ability to diagnose you over the Internet No I do not I do not have any way of determining the cause or the significance of your symptoms based solely on your brief posting I do not know your medical history nor do I have the ability to reach out and examine you  all essential components to getting an accurate diagnosis While I am very sympathetic to your financial situation and lack of insurance there is very little that can be achieved without a handon medical examination Look for free clinics student health centers or urgent care facilities Give you body and your health the same consideration as you would if your car suddenly broke down and needed a costly repair Obviously without the ability to see these blisters firsthand I cannot offer you a patientspecific answer but many people who see blisterlike growths on the pharynx throat are really seeing ectopic lymph tissue often referred to as cobblestones in the medical world this area is rich in lymph tissue Cobblestoning can be found in a variety of medical conditions  basically anything that causes inflammation Allergies even if no allergies were identified and recurrent viral infections irriation from postnasal drainage etc all can cause these cobblestonelike effects Unless a bacterial infections is diagnosed by a culture or rapid Strep test antibiotics especially massive antibitoics tend to have no curative effects Blisters filled with pus would not be common for cobblestones If she also gets bronchitis at the same time it may not be related to this throat finding at all Most cases of bronchitis are viral Although a specific reason has not be determined by her medical providers it would be wise to keep looking Yesif you have an STD in your throat Not likely Bactrima sulfa drugis not used to treat Strep The only way to improve the viscosity of your saliva is to just drink more Hydration will help that dry throat but you can also try a teaspoonful of honey periodically to help coat the throat Yes Snoring and mouthbreathing can dry out the pharyngeal throat mucous membranes and this can cause the throat to be sore Assuming that your sore throat is caused by acid reflux I would advise that you consult your medical provider now Not all cases of heartburn are due to reflux and not all reflux treatments are appropriate for everyone Your doctor may need to do run a few diagnostic tests before prescribing a patientspecific treatment regime Most sore throats are viral and do not require antibiotics at all The only sore throats that need treated are the ones that are Strep proven by a lab test A persistent sore throat can be due to allergy mononucleosis postnasal drainage from a sinus infection or just from congestion where you are mouthbreathing Since I cannot examine you over the Internet you will need to consult or see your medical provider again for another examinationlooking for other causes You can get a flu vaccine when you have a cold or you can wait a few more days Colds only last about a week A person under treatment for Strep can still have a sore throat for several more days but they are not considered contagious about a day after starting an appropriate antibitoic regime The real purpose of the antibiotic is to prevent more serious albeit rare Strep complications not so much for just treating the throat You bet This is one of the possible characteristic signs but you do not see this with every case of Strep throat As a matter of fact there are TWO different tongue signs a RED strawberry tongue and a WHITE coated strawberry tongue I dont knowI didnt see it you did There are many possibilities but consider a TONSILLITH a tonsil stone that has dislodged You can find information about cryptic tonsils and tonsillitis on WebMD ENT board or by a WebMD or Google search It is possible but any injury would likely be very minor and accidental since the throat is really not touched A tongue depressor is used to push down the tongue in order to see the throat The child may now have an unrelated sore throat gagging from postnasal drainage or have a croupy voice from laryngeal irritationthings that have nothing to do with the examination Whooping cough pertussis can be laboratory proven by an lab testand so can Strep It is possible to develop both since they are two different organisms I trust that you are under the care of a good medical provider who has properly tested you examined you and have you under appropriate treatment These are not things you should selfdiagnose or treat at home Techinically yessince you still have a throat and perhaps even some tonsillar remnants that can harbor the Strep bacteria Strep after a tonsillectomy is uncommon however Unless your doctor actually did a test rapid strep test or culture to CONFIRM that you have Strep the diagnosis could be incorrect You may have a viral infection or even Mono Obviously since I cant examine you I have no way of making that important diagnostic call Most viral infections improve on day four even if you do nothing so if you are not improving you need to see your medical provider again If a person is allergic to house dust they can develop a chronic illness chronic allergies from it House dust is not a cause of lung cancer unless that dust had carcinogens in it like asbestos Maybe your boyfriend should come to YOUR house from now on Not directly but if you want to drink orange juice and the acidic nature of this juice does not hurt your throat go for it Orange juice will not cure or even improve Strep throat however but OJ is wetand hydration is very important when you are sick Allergies Chronic sinusitis Unfortunately it would not be possible to diagnose or treat you over the Internet since we do not know anything about you your medical history nor have a way of examining you firsthand I would suggest that you see a medical provider so you can be properly assessed and treated based on a patientspecific diagnosisnot a blind guess Saline gargles a weak salt solution of 14 tsp of salt to 8 oz of water used as a gargle will help sooth a sore throat and loosen any exudate that white stuff that often accumulates on or around the tonsils Most people tend to overdo the salt partmaking it too strong to tolerate Yes it would be appropriate for you to see a medical provider so that you can have your throat properly examined A sore throat primarily in the mornings wiht improvement in the afternoon may be due to postnasal drainage at night accompanied by mouthbreathing Allergies can cause this but so can back to back viral infections Mononucleosis is a virus that can cause a sore throat People also worry about a lingering Strep infection so this can be tested for during your examination if your medical provider feels it is necessary As you have read there are many possibilities to consider so you are wise to seek medical care at this point I think you should SEE your doctor if you have a sore throat A direct examination and perhaps a diagnostic test for Strep is really the best way to determine the cause of your sore throat White strips are not a clinical sign of Strep so nothis is not typical If you had a confirming lab test rapid strep or culture then your diagnosis was most likely accurate and you will be feeling better soon assuming you are on the correct antibiotic If you were diagnosed clinically  just by a visual examination  then there is a 5050 chance that your diagnosis was incorrect and you do NOT have Strep but rather a viral infection Viruses do not respond at all to antibiotics and one virus in particular  the one that causes mono can actually become worse when you are taking antibiotics Strep assuming your selfdiagnosis is correct can cause kidney infections as well but I would have no idea if they are related in your case without a handson examination and a thorough medical history White pockets on your throat is NOT a definitive sign of Strep Why dont you see your medical provider for a rapid strep test urinalysis and a proper examination This would answer your kidney stone and infection concern There are a few possibilities First there actually could be something caught in your throat but this would take a thorough examination by an ENT using a fiberoptic scope to make that call Second Inflammation from variety of events including reflux perhaps from a hiatal hernia as you mentioned something compressing your esophagus thyroid irritation from foodmedicinessmoking etc Third It could be psychological but before anyone tries to make this assumptiion ALL organic causes need to be ruled out I dont knowI do not know anything about your wife her habits her medical history nor do I have a way of determining the source of the blood based solely on your posting She would need to see a medical provider and be properly examined if this continues Hemoptysis blood in the spit can have numerous causes from simple bleeding for irritated or infected throat or nasal tissue to more ominous causes I dont knowI cant see them Your description of red bumps is way too vague for me to even guess A medical provider would need to examine you firsthand to offer you a definitive answer The terrible thing is that you may or may not need ANY antibiotics Most viral infections are viruses and do not require antibiotics A few are Strep but making a selfdiagnosis based solely on symptoms is not much better than a coin toss Some viral sore throats are mono mononucleosis I cant blindly diagnose you over the Internet and you may or may not have the skills to accurately diagnose yourself so my recommendation is for you to be TESTED for Strep at student healtha simple rapid test If you do have it then the amoxicillin may be appropriate assuming you have the proper doseyou didnt share that information for your weight and severity of infection Now Penicillin never works for tonsil stones The problem is that your tonsils have holescrypts in them that trap food and other debris Gargling after every meal will limit the accumulation of debris or you can take a moistened Qtip or your finger and physicallyl dislodge them They will come back again however The only definitive cure is to remove the tonsils if you and your ENT can convince the insurance company that this is medicallynecessary Yes a healthy immune system assuming you have one will handle Strep throat The reason why we try and detect and treat Strep is to prevent the possible COMPLICATIONS of Strep namely heart or kidney disease I suspect that most people have had Strep in their lifetime only to have it resolve spontaneously but that does not mean you should not seek medical care if you have any of the signs of Strep bright red dotted throat fever etc If you do have Strep and you are one of those rare people that develop a complication money will be the least of your problems While medical care is expensive just like getting your car repaired you still have to open that wallet sometimes and take care of yourself if you dont have insurance You do realized that I have no way of SEEING this problem that you are concerned about I cannot blindly address this particular question over the Internet An ENTEar Nose and THROAT specialist Scarlet fever is caused by Strep It would not be likely that this person would still be contagious months later unless of course they are a Strep carrier People can get exposed to Strep quite easily by other people or from objects that area contaminated by Strep The only way you will know for sure if you have Strep is to be tested ClaritinZyrtecand Allegra are longacting nonsedating antihistamines They are all compatible with Singulair The tonsils may have little holes or crypts in them that can trap food and other debris Sometimes this debris can calcify and create a little stonelike mass called a tonsilliths tonsil stone Since I have no way of seeing your little white spot firsthand it would not be possible for me or any medical provider to be able to give you an exact answer based solely on your brief description It is possible to have localized infections so since you are concerned it would be in your best interest to have your tonsils examined by a health care professional Many people get canker soresaphthous ulcers This is not a sign of anything bad or ominous They should resolve spontaneously in a week or soif not you will need to see your medical provider for an examination You will need to see your medical provider so you can be properly examined Your vague description of a thing hanging beside the uvula is really not sufficient for me to even guess as to the nature of this finding Orcall the doctor again I am not sure of the reason for the antibiotic if the Strep test was negative That usually indicates a virus and viruses including mono do not respond at all to any antibiotic The reason for the continue fever may also indicate that an antibiotic may have been unnecessary but of course I wasnt there and cant see his throat With that said if he is in pain not swallowing having another examination is prudent He could still have mono since some early tests are false negative and not as accurate It depends on the severity of your allergic reaction For instance someone who may be allergic to bees should not just get stung again to see what happens Someone who may be allergic to peanuts can have a fatal allergic reaction so it would not be wise to test with peanuts again There are excellent blood tests for food allergies One sample of blood can be tested for dozens and dozens of different food allergies from your list This is a safer way of making an accurate determination Strep does not really have classic white spotsit tends to have classic red spots called petechiae It is okay to take a person outside when they have Strep but unless he was on an appropriate antibiotic for at least 24 hours I would not expose him to other people I dont know that age of your son Since I dont know how you were diagnosed lab culture rapid strep test or just a look and see by your medical provider penicillin remains the treatment of choice for treating TRUE labdiagnosed Group A beta hemolytic Strep also known as Strep Throat A Zpack is really not the appropriate dose for treating Strep and I dont know the dose you received of the penicillin I can say that failure of antibiotics often means that you a never had Strep but a viral sore throat  in which case no antibiotic would help b you were not treated appropriately either by dosage etc for a labdiagnosed case c you are a Strepcarrier this can be difficult to cure by oral antibiotics or d you have monomononucleosis that clinicallymimicked Strep throat  in this case you need to have a lab test called an EBV Panel to see if you have mono Either way you need to contact your medical provider  the only one that can order any additional lab tests andor treat you further I dont know what she is taking but there is a very common amoxicillin side effect that can produce a rash near the end of the antibiotic course of treatment Scarlet fever tends to be a generalized all over the body bright red sandpaperyrough skin rash that will eventually peel especially on the palms and feet A person would not typically get a scarlet fever eruption on day six using an antibiotic that could treat strep again I dont know what she is taking Was your daughter labdiagnosed with Strep rapid strep swab or a Strep culture or was it a clinical diagnosis the medical provider just examined her throat and said Strep Clinical diagnoses of Strep are no more accurate than a cointoss in most instances You are talking about three DIFFERENT types of vaginitis yeast is fungal  BV is bacterial  and Trich is a parasite  BV or yeast does not cause trich Of course you can catch all three at the same time Tinnitus does not cause the face to droop but Bells Palsy can The same virus that may have caused your tinnitusringing could be the same virus that is now cause some nerve problems in those facial muscles Many times this is a herpes simplex virus I suggest that you see your medical provider right away about this droopy face since there are medications that can help Viruses with the exception of MONO mononucleosis do not last six weeks Just because a cause has not been found does not mean your doctor should give up looking Did he check your thyroid Did he do a mono test Liver function tests Blood culture Are you depressed or under stress There are more things that can be done so until you are feeling better Jenny your doctor needs to continue your diagnostic workup or send you to a specialist Clindamycin is fineit is one of the antibiotics of choice for a Staph infection As far as a followup culture is concerned there is nothing inappropriate in having one to be sure the Staph has resolved from the antibiotic Ask the treating medical provider for patientspecific advice however since I do not know the TYPE of Staph that he has As much as I would like to answer your call for help it is not possible for me to blindly diagnose or treat you over the Internet so the next and most important step is yours to take You will need to see a medical provider so that you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated You may have a Strep throat and need antibiotics but you will need testing first Viral infections including mononucleosis can also cause severe sore throats Treatment will depend on your diagnosis In order to help yourself you will need to see a medical provider today An urgent care facility would be good if your doctors office cannot see you You may have a torus palate  You can look that up on the Internet Could it be a swollen gland that just makes it feel like your adams apple has moved Your larynx is pretty firmly attached and you would be having debilitating pain and great difficulty breathing if it had moved No its not unusual The effects of the illness will still exist because it takes a while a week or so for the bug to be annihilated by the penicillin and your immune system Also penicillin increases your white blood cell count and so your own body is still fighting the bug The medication itself doesnt fight it Your body is still going through the purging process of getting rid of the bug So you will still feel sick and tired for a while Taking too much penicillin can cause ill effects as well so try not to do that Just let it run its course My youngest child never had a sore throat with strep When he went back to school every year I could count on a call from the nurse within two or three months and it would be strep He would have a rash on his torso and no other symptoms Yes snoring can cause a sore throat This is a common problem among snorers your throat is bruised so theres not alot you can do but you can try to not talk and maybe drink tea and honey just to coat your throat Is it possible that I never even had an infection and therefore did not require antibiotics So its possible that something else is wrong then I know this was posted a long time ago but I want to add that it could also be Vincents Gingivitis or Trench Mouth becoming more common among stressedout college kids and many other people in the past two decades Check with a doctor if it happens again After 4 days I know this has been resolved for now but it might happen again This kind of thing happens to me very frequently and what I do is  youre not going to like this  try to trigger my gag reflex not to vomit but just to launch the obstructing piece of food from my throat Try to force a cough and use your throat muscles nature should do the rest Just try not to aspirate breathe in the obstruction If this just happened the once things should be okay But for some people including me this kind of thing is almost a daily occurrence In that case not only is choking to death a danger so is a condition that can lead to esophageal cancer if untreated Barretts Esophagus caused by erosive GERD where the cells lining the esophagus change to resemble stomach lining cells instead Having Scleraderma can also predispose a person to developing Barretts I knew three people with Scleraderma one is still alive and she chokes frequently If GERD is not corrected such as by taking Prevacid or Prilosec this can result in Barretts Esophagus the dangerous precancerous condition mentioned above A gasteroenterologist can tell for sure if this is present by biopsying the lining of the esophagus during a panendoscopy During mine my gastroenterologist stretched my esophagus slightly with an instrument designed to inflate inside it under anesthesia This can help to prevent choking episodes but it can only be done once or twice  It sounds like an ENT or gastroenterology issue Gastric reflux can be very damaging to the esophagus as well as the teeth Oral rinses may help but it sounds like a medical problem Start with your internist Loss of voice can be caused due to many reason Injury swelling or disease such as Acid reflux such as heartburnThickening of the vocal chords Nodules or polyps on the vocal chords Muscle tension dysphonia Damage to the nerves that affect how the larynx function Bronchitis is also a reason which can result of exposure to airway irritants such as tobacco smoke household cleaning agents smog etc For more information on this you can visit PharmacySell To help with future coldsupper respiratory I would highly suggest start taking a Prebiotic and Probiotic DAILY Its helped me tremendously and there has been recent medical articles supporting this Even with out a fever you can still be sick You could have a virus that is going around But with sore throat and swollen glands could possibly be strep throat which can in some cases make you have nausea You do not always run a fever with strep throat I am not a doctor but it does not hurt to go to the DR The worst thing they can say is it is a virus and it has to take its course Hello about 3 yrs ago I started to get weak then started to get tired all the time Also I started having chills like the flu So I went to my doctor and he sent me directly to the emergency room They said after I got seen that I had Pneumonia hopefully you dont have it Had to stay in hosptital a wk My daughter had similar symptoms and tested positive for strep throat You should probably follow up with your Dr Sounds like you have a sinus or chest cold If the blood is just thin streaks then I dont think theres much to worry about Nothing that a round of antibiotics wouldnt cure And if you smoke STOP If if more than streaky blood in your sputum mucusflem SEEK medical attention immediately These could be signs of a more serious condition I believe HCTZ Hydrochlorothiazide maybe a possible one This sounds like to me a bad case of GERD Have your family practitioner check you out Yes it is used as an alternative for some people over pen vk Has your primary care provider suggested allergy testing I have a friend who would cough so hard that he passed out They did allergy screening found out he was allergic to molds pollens and dander and started him on allergy shots Have you had a repeat chest xray Are you running a fever When you cough are you bring up anything If so does it have color This information would be helpful for your primary care provider as well My other suggestion would be to ask for a pulmonologist referral I hope you get some

and adenoids If you still have them they might be causing your sore throat I had a similar problem last year My doctors thought I had strep and put me on antibiotics and then put me on allergy medication but when I went to a ear nose and throat specialist they said that my tonsils themselves were the problem and they had to remove them Sometimes general practitioners may not catch a problem like that so it may be necessary to go see a specialist who can more accurately diagnose your problem no You may want to check if it is really a cold you have and not a allergy of some kind My son used to have a runny nose all the time before we realized that it is not a cold but a allergy Strep throat and you need antibiotics right away no This also happens to my girlfriend the doctor told her she needed more iron in her blood this worked but whenever she stopped taking iron pills she got dizzy and had headaches again so probably a good diet with lots of iron I thought strep throat was very contagous for 48 hours without medication could be indijestion or heart goal bladder heart burn no Please check out this website You should really see your family physician 10 When Should I Call the

cause menstruation to fluctuate so your best bet is to simply relax The condom as you stated didnt have any holes and didnt break so as long as the guy put the condom on correctly you should be fine My ex and I had sex in high school when we were 14 6 years ago with no birth control and no condom for the first 3 times Let me say that it was incredibly dumb to do but we were both nervous awaiting her period and to scare the hit out of us even more she had a skipped period but was never pregnant Just relax your most likely panicking for no reason Hope this helps yes u can but there are many types of strep once you get a certain type u then become immune to that type So u could have it many times just different types gargle wantiseptic infection your voice goes higher Hi there Thank you for answering my question Id move on to someone who has better health habitsthere must be something thats causing you to get a sore throat if its happening the next day after kissing him Maybe his dental hygene is poor as well as his health habitsdoesnt seem worth it unless he comes around and takes better carebut he has to make that choice on his own stay away from oral sex There were recent discoveries of spreading conditionsdiseasevirus through oral sex So stay safe and dont do it If this feeling was caused by running a race or by running a lot faster than your normal pace then its most likely lactic acid Its ok to run just run at an easy pace for a few days I usually feel this way after any 10k or more race Nothing to worry about Its entirely possible to have multiple infections at the same time but your doctor is right antibiotics should clear any bacterial infections right up The sore throat is likely being caused by post nasal drip from your sinus infection If its strep you should see small white patches on your tonsils and its extremely painful If after you finish your round of antibiotics you still have a serious sore throat then you should go back to the doctor for more tests Good luck no most antibiotics they give for strep are Ammoxicilian ammoxicilian clavulanateAugmentin brand name cephalexin or Keflex brand name never heard of the drug you are speaking of I know you dont have insurance but think of your health I recently thought I was having an ear infection so went to doctor but did not want to pay high medical bill so went to clinic inside Walgreens and turns out it was only a skin infection of the outer ear was given cephalexin for 10 days since I can only take liquid meds have troubles taking pills I have insurance and ended up only paying 20 for the visit and 5 for the meds You should try Take Care clinic at Walgreens or MinuteClinic at CVS their prices seem to be very reasonable without insurance my visit would have been only 89 yes go back to the Dr Bronchitis can become pneumonia have you talked to the doctor and poison control they should have treatment for various type of chemical blister on lip get blistex if that doesnt work then get vaseline the thick oilyfatty one not the hand cream as it has thick layer to protect and moisturize Have you tried any nasal rinses I have horrible sinuses and allergies My ENT doctor recommended a saline sinus rinse and it works really well Check out your local pharmacies and consult with the pharmacist There are a variety of rinses Hope it helps Yes she probably does have bronchitis but since she has asthma she probably has asthmatic bronchitis go to ER anaphylaxis can require in depth treatment specialist to solve the problem and education on prevention try different hospital someone needs to do something different think about what u have done different recently when it started and its something u r still exposing urself to soap detergent new food or something u have used before that u have now developed an allergy to make a list and stop one at a time and u will figure out what it is The best thing you can possibly do to avoid a sore throat after kissing this jerk is to gargel with straight  Hydroden Peroxide for at least 2 minutes Yes it taste awful and is nasty stuff but it will keep You from getting a sore throat Works every time Do this before going to bed and do not rinse Your mouth or drink any thing else until morning John I would definitely look into and have retested by the Endorinologist I have dealt with unexplained pain fatigue weight gain Asthma symptoms Asthma Meds did not helpand many other symptoms and doctors were unable to come up with a diagnosis Thyroid tested fine etc I did find out that I have GERD this is due to vagus stomach nerve not working but none of the meds I tried seemed to help wthose symptoms either My diet doctor tested my thyroid function and found it to be a little low She prescribed a 14 grain of NatureThroid daily and the difference in my joint pain alone is amazing She also prescribed Phentermine which not only helps me lose weight but seems to work in conjunction with Thyroid Med My symptoms of fibro get even better when I am taking both of them I wake up feeling refreshed I dont have trouble walking due to aching joints I used to get so tired I would stutter and forget what I was talking about midsentence Even my stomach problems have all but disappeared Do the research there are many sites and support groups for Fibromyalgia online I would also look into symptoms of low thyroid mine was not that low and was causing lots of havoc Also I think finding the right type of Doctor for exmy Diet Doctor deals with thyroid problems daily and therefore is more knowledgeable is key I would get as much info as I could regarding my symptoms so as to be better able to paint a clearer picture of what is going on to the Endocrinologist you are going to see Ask for a referral to another ENT Sounds like the inflammation is only getting worse they may tell you polyps Chicken noodle soup and the like helped to sooth my daughters irritation and they finally prescribed Augmentin

FROMhttpwwwncbinlmnihgovpubmedhealthPMH0002347 IVE HAD THIS PROBLEM SEVERAL TIMES AND WAS DISCOVERED TO FIND THAT I WAS ANEMIC THERE IS MEDS YOU CAN TAKE TO HELP it posible that if you feel like there something in your throat and it began after you started throwing up your throat could just be sore and swollen that happens  now the more important question when u say mucus what does it look like

i needed  also does it burn thats another sign its stomach mucus  if you begin to throw up yellow water what looks like yellow water def go to the hospital it happend to me thats the water stuff in simple terms from your small intestines and that can be very bad i would say if you can to drink as muchh water as possible it will help  cause throwin up takes alot of water out of your body and eat light foods  and go see your doctor about this it wont get better without help hope this answerd your question it does take time if your coughing it up thats a good thing your bodies breaking it down

much worse  youll be fine in to time  hope this helps Antibiotics are not an enemy You dont have to worry about killing your immune system The only time people really have to worry about antibiotics is if they take them on a regular basis over and over again andor when they dont need them As you have only taken them once that you know of Im sure you are in the clear As for the strep throat the best defense is hand hygeine Wash your hand often and use hand sanitizer Homeopathic remedies can and do work so dont give those up Just remember that if you have a fever that lasts more than a day or two or a sore throat with difficulty swallowing for a week or more you should probably see a doctor It sounds to me like you may have GERD or acid reflux Ive never had heart burn but I do have GERD It started with a bad taste in the back of my throat and a nasty tasting cough I could also feel it in my sinuses The acid from your stomach can affect your voice as well Look up GERD here on WebMD It seems like you have quite a few of the symptoms Good Luck  Hi my name is nohealani and believe it or not when my nose gets that bad as wierd as this may sound when I go to sleep at nite or when Im at home relaxing I get some tissue and roll it up and put it up each of my nostrilsIt really helps me at nite because Im not constantly getting up to blow my nose It usually takes a few days but before you know it your nose will dry up sounds wierd but wouldnt hurt to try it and it doesnt cost anything I used to get strep once or twice a year I received the same treatment just about every time The antibiotics I received usually made me feel better about two to three days after consistent use Gone within a week I think it is a swollen gland I get them sometimes as well I have also had the same problem of pain when swallowing food I have drunk hot tea with honey no milk and that helps with the pain Drink often as needed and the pain will subside Honey acts like an antibiotic and has natural healing powers unlike over the counter medications no this could cause heart palpitations and increase her blood pressure Sounds like thrushdefinitely go see a doctor as this usually happens because of suppression of the immune system An antifungal will clear it up if it is thrush Hello I am not a doctor but i can help a bit You did not specify as to whether or not you had protected or unprotected vaginal sex Protected vaginal sex puts you at a low risk where as unprotected vaginal sex puts you at a high risk of contracting HIV There are no clinical symptoms associated with HIV This means that no consistent physical symptoms have been observed among people with HIV With that being said some infected individuals do experience a strong flulike illness 23 weeks post exposure and this last for about 810 days However some infected individuals experience no symptoms at all The World Health Organization guidelines consider all testing to be conclusive at 3 months So make sure to get tested after 4 weeks try using more pillows to elevate your head so you do not have to resort to sleeping in recliner No it is not you could pass the virus on to other people Lidocaine is a topical analgesic it is a pain killer and really has no properties to cure anything it just makes it feel better while it heals Have they checked for blockage from the heart just wondering Could be an allergic reaction to something Maybe a medicine youve been taking Hair in your throat feeling Do you have pets in your home at all If so you may really have a piece of hair in your throat I have

HAVE THYROID DISEASE and this is called a  Goiter immdiate attention is needed to family physician first then heshe will send you to an Encronologist for testing of Thyroid Disease no Sources Sounds like you are experiencing sleep apnea If you are waiting up not being able to breath it is most likely that strep throat I think it can be but not always I would go in to have a biopsy done of it for the past couple of weeks i have experienced the same symptoms but its becuse i am preagnant im in my first trimester mabye you are you shuld mabye just check just to make shure I should also add that my temperature runs low  I am usually 976 so a fever of 100 is significant Seek medical attention now This could be related to a more serious condition rather than just a headache Because your headache presents itself when you lie down this could be tumor related I had the same symptom for 3 months When I finally went in and they did a CT Scan I had a Primary Brain Tumor You might have high blood pressure Im surprised your ENT didnt order you to get a CT scan I had a swollen lymph node in my neck for several months and I was eventually diagnosed with lymphoma "}
