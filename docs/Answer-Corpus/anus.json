{"text": "It sounds like you have genital herpes or warts Have you had any flu like symptoms too Often times people with gential herpes will get flu like symptoms upon their first outbreak When someone with genital herpes has an outbreak sores will appear in their genital area including around the anus these sores will often cause extreme pain or discomfort especially when urinating Next time the sores appear have a doctor test them for the STD or you can get a blood test which might offer a more difinitive answer A general or rectal surgeon is the appropriate physician to see for treatment of an anal abscess An abscess is a collection of pus An anal abscess may develop in the deep tissues surrounding the anus or be more shallow under the skin They both require immediate treatment to lance the abscess and let it drain Therefore it is important that you see a surgeon A general practitioner may be able to take care of a small abscess in the office Antibiotics alone usually cannot treat the problem Without proper treatment an abscess can cause a widespread infection septicemia You are more likely to get an anal abscess if you have diabetes inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohns engage in anal sex or have an impaired immune system such as from AIDS or chemotherapy If you have recurrent anal abscesses and there is no clear explanation for their cause a consultation with a physician who specializes in diseases of the gastrointestinal tract gastroenterologist may be appropriate  Your posting appears to be inappropriate for WebMD Answers I dont need to see any pictures The obvious reactions that you were attempting to achieve by inserting sexually crude content failed I am neither shocked nor angry I am disappointed I had this problem and it turned out to be a hemorrhoid my doctor recommended benefiber which is taste free and it actually worked With his diet laid out that way it looks to me like he may have a possible yeast infectionfrom al those starches in his dietIs the child overweight And does he not eat meat  It is not normal to bleed for 2 weeks following anal sex You may have experienced anal or rectal tearing or other problems If you try anal sex again in the future consider using a lot of waterbased lubricant going slowly and stopping if you experience any pain at all  I would also like to indicate that I only started havin these symptoms after I looked them and started worrying about Also just talked to the girl she said she was clean Im sorry to hear youre going through this How unpleasant Id recommend you have this situation checked out by a doctor If youre scratching something is causing you to itch And you need to find out what is causing the itching It could be something simple like a fungal infection   But then again it could be some type of  While youre waiting for your appointment with a health care provider its very important you Do not have sex even with a condom Do not scratch the affected areas Wash your hands frequently To ease the itching feeling you probably are safe to wash the affected areas gently with warm soapy water and thoroughly dry them You may find it helpful to soak in a tub of warm water with an oatmeal bath Assuming youre not allergic to any medications you might try using a bland powder cornstarch or talc to keep the area dry until you can get a diagnosis from the doctor I wish you all the best Yes this could be normal If you have hemorrhoids for example inserting a toy into the rectum could cause a bit of bleeding You could have small internal hemorrhoids and not even know it As long as the bleeding is not severe and doesnt cause you pain or discomfort youre probably not in any danger You might try avoiding any overthecounter NSAID pain relievers aspirin motrin ibuprofen naproxen for a few days prior to having anal sex Those products make a person bleed easier Hope this helps The short answer is Everyone should know hisher HIV status You may have known your status prior to this episode of unprotected anal sex but now your status may have changed It would be in your best interest to get tested again Because which is what the HIV test is designed to detect you may need to be tested several times over the next 12 months to be sure you didnt pick up the virus from your sex partner Id also suggest you have a conversation with your health care provider about whether or not you should take more aggressive measures than repeated screenings He or she is in the best position to advise you Above all else please practice safe sex by using a condom Unprotected anal sex isnt a wise idea but remember its also possible to transmit HIV through vaginal sex Anyone who is sexually active should take responsibility for the safety of himherself and hisher partner Hope this helps Im glad you asked this question Many people would be too embarrassed but its important to discuss these difficult subjects I suggest you make an appointment with your primary health care provider as soon as possible to discuss the situation A small amount of mucus in the stool or coming from the anus isnt necessarily cause for alarm However larger amounts of mucus especially if its mucus alone not with stool could indicate a health condition that needs to be addressed Youd be wise to start a conversation with your doctor about this in order to obtain treatment if required Wishing you well Im sorry youre dealing with this but its a good thing you noticed You need to get these pimples checked out right away Lesions in the vagina in the area of the vulva or around the anus can be signs of a sexually transmitted disease such as or  If you have one of these conditions its imperative you know it so you can get appropriate treatment and understand what you need to do to protect your sex partners These STDs are easily transmitted Until youve had these pimples diagnosed you must avoid having sex of any kind oral vaginal anal Of course its possible the pimples youre describing are not any kind of STD This is why you need to see a health care provider to receive a diagnosis Please remember to always practice safe sex by using a condom A properly used condom will not protect against the transmission of all sexually transmitted diseases but its a good start Take care The good news is Probably not The Dtap vaccine which includes dipetheria tetanus and pertussis is considered protective for 10 years We recommend everyone get revaccinated with Dtap every decade That said the only way to tell for sure youre protected because not all vaccines take the way theyre supposed to is to look at your blood antibodies If your blood contains antibodies toward tetanus then youre golden Bottom line Your best bet is to consult a health care provider Even if youre up to date on your tetanus vaccination that wound could get infected with bacteria which could cause problems Better to have it looked at and washed out if necessary Hope this helps Well I dont know But I am sorry youre going through this The only way to discover what these mystery lesions are is through a physical examination by a medical professional Several conditions could cause the blisters you describe and some of those conditions are more serious than others I recommend you see a doctor as soon as possible to get this diagnosed and treated Meanwhile please avoid having sex even with a condom Because you describe lesions that cover a fairly broad area a condom may not protect your partner from contacting one of these blisters In the event this is some kind of  you dont want to risk infecting anyone else I hope youre able to get this treated promptly Feel better soon Well my friend it sounds like you are  And on top of that probably have a  yes That would account for any visible red blood on the stool or in the toilet water after you have a bowel movement While I applaud your devotion to Greek yogurt I agree its probably wise to cut back from 812 containers per day Eating excessive amounts of dairy products can indeed cause constipation If you manage your constipation you can avoid further trouble from hemorrhoids First you need to make sure youre drinking plenty of water each day Second eat a fiberrich diet that includes a sizable portion of minimally cooked plant foods In the short term you can take an overthecounter stool softener NOT laxative such as docusate sodium Please do not do anything radical like a bowel cleanse Its not necessary and can disrupt the natural flora of your gut which are important for your immune system Just read up on constipation using the link above and you should find your problems resolving within a week or two Wishing you well Generally if there is sufficient lubrication and gentleness bleeding is not a problem There is a sexual practice called fisting also some very large objects have been removed from the rectum by ER doctors Thus if the anal opening can relax enough or be lax enough there is less chance for bleeding from trauma However if the recipient has an internal hemorrhoid very common or rectal polyps bleeding can be possible These are common sources of bright red blood on the stoolespecially a hard stool Small anal fissures in the tissue can also prompt bleeding but this is often less overt blood than internal hemorrhoids or polyps Bottom line the duration of bleeding depends upon the actual source If you continue to have problems PLEASE see your GYN or clinic There is a short clear plastic device that a GYN can use to look for internal hemorrhoids or polyps just inside the anus It is totally OK to talk about your symptoms and sexual practices with the GYN We have seen and heard about just about everything in terms of sexual practices Nope you will not be able to play if you just leave the pain You must see your doctor and tell himher what you have The doctor should give you something for your foot Thanks It ended up going away on its own I think it was from my wisdom teeth trying to come in They still havent come in They come out and then go back in and then out again I have no idea as I have never done anal but if you do not feel right since this in counter you should go to the docs just to be on the safe side This is the product Alli or Orlistat thats available overthecounter and is still available as prescription known as Xenical What they do is it actually binds to fat thats in fatty foods and it absorbs it and makes it bind together so when you actually have a bowel movement its passed through that way So its never really absorbed in the body the fat Triazole 938 its like a sponge it soaks it up Its very safe It is effective The overthecounter version is actually half of the dose of the prescription so therefore there are less treatment effects such as abdominal pain A lot of people say that they see oil or fatty stools thats absolutely fine thats actually the medication working What it does is it tries to train you to eat better The Alli website has a lot of great examples of menus They even have a book that will tell you when you go to places like McDonalds or Burger King what you can and cannot eat If you happened to have a really fatty meal youre going to know because you probably will be in the bathroom for a little bit longer than what you expected but once again its training you to eat healthier So they are really good product and once again all their literature is great because they advise you that you should be doing things like exercising and drinking more water using things like a pedometer tracking your progress and then also having realistic expectations Youre not going to lose 20 pounds in one month thats not really a good goal to have Gradual weight loss is the way to go and if you end up losing two or three pounds per month thats great and plus too youre changing your lifestyle A lot of pharmacists have gotten a lot of questions about this product since it was launched in 2007 and it really has been a great way for pharmacists to get to know their patients better Come and ask us for the medication experts were happy to help you Yes it is very important that you see a health care provider as soon as possible and get a tetanus shot Let me first start by saying I am not a doctor just your fellow WebMD follower and I have had Crohns Disease for 12 years and know a little something about bowel movements Two important questions My first question is is the blood red or black Red blood means there is irritation either from a hemorrhoid or rectal bleeding which generally is not concerning It either means you need to start drinking more water andor taking stool softeners You usually can tell if you need more water by bleeding and large hard stools My next question would be If the blood is black or the stool is tarry this is where you need to see a doctor This means there is bleeding up high in the colon or intestine a colposcopy is highly recommended I suspect what you are feeling is a large hemorrhoid when you feel inside Again I hate to say it but see a doctor andor stick to extra water stool softeners and continue with you yogurt as this will balance you Without being able to examine the area it sounds like either a hemorrhoid or possibly an abscess  However your doctor needs to examine you to exactly determine what it is In addition to the bump a hemorrhoid is often itchy Its typically caused by constipation or having to strain more when having a bowel movement They arent typically sore but can be especially if they get inflamed However an abscess is more likely to be tender as it is a bacterial infection with a build up of pus in the area I have included a couple of links above to help you learn more about both of these conditions You need to determine exactly whats causing it by seeing your doctor in order to know how to treat it It could be one of these conditions or something else Could it be a hemorrhoid Preparation H Hi Just

of backed stools at the same time see what they say Good Luck Hi See Above Answer sorry it wont come up without a prompt glitch on WebMD Sounds like leg cramps Try a 6 oz glass of tonic water before each bedtime I am glad that you went to the doctor for an exam and testing From what you have described it does not sound like Herpes A primary new infection typically takes 2 to 14 days to present itself A Herpes outbreak typically lasts 13 weeks and consists of blisters which cause pain itching and burning First off consult a doctor for a std screening Secondly one of your partners most likely one of the two who gave you a blowjob may have had a virus or infection in their mouth Absolutely Tetanus shots are statistically good for ten years although many clinicians will suggest a booster after five years Tetanus shots only prevent tetanus lockjawit does NOT prevent a wound infection so watch for any signs of infection It is really up to you to get a tetanus booster or not but theoreticallyl your vaccine is 2008 is still effective You need to get another tetanus shot Yes the vaccine lasts ten years but not to the day or month To be safe get another one and you will be good for ten more years The vaccine is 100 effective and tetanus the disease is just about 100 fatal so it pays to be safe I have lots of ideas but ideas are NOT diagnoses You cannot make a blind diagnosis over the Internet based solely on a vague description of bumps let alone recommend a treatment The ONLY way that you can have these bumps properly diagnosed is to see a medical professional Once there is a definitive diagnosis you can thenand only thendiscuss treatments The bumps could be hemorrhoidsskin tagswarts condylomataor  There are numerous possibilities Because you are also having problems with defecation this is another reason to see a medical professional Unfortunately without the ability to examine your foot I would have no idea if you will be able to play in your tournament a few days from now Medical providers do not like making blind decisions like this so you will need to be examined A tetanus vaccine prevents tetanus but does not prevent INFECTION Deeper wounds like you have described could become infected if not cared for properly No it does not Tetanus shots only protect against one thingtetanus Although not specifically approved for cold sores antiherpetic drugs used for genital herpes and other herpetic infections like Shingles and chicken pox may help These would include medications like acylovir Famvir etc You would need to address this with your medical provider I would suggest that you see your medical provider so that you can have your rectum examined or have a flatplate xray of your abdomen No bowel movement for a week would seem to indicate a possible stool impaction but your comment about the anal area being obstructed concerns me that you could have a foreign body do you think this is possible or even a rectal prolapse Even if you are carefully examined a week ago it would be good to be reexamined Something is amiss That would be a a colorectal surgeon In some areas a gastroenterologist or general surgeon may do this type of procedure An anal abscess can be a simple drainage procedure or a more involved surgical removal so finding the most skilled specialist is important Without the ability to see this beadsized lump near your anus firsthand Please dont post a picture I cannot blindly determine what you have but some possibilities include anal skin tags hemorrhoids skin abscess condylomata warts etcmany things There is no way to avoid the inevitableyou must see a medical provider so you can have this properly examined diagnosed and treated If you want an exact answer then you will need to be examined by a medical professional Based on the information you have shared there is a very good chance that you do have a perirectal abscess or a pilonidal abscess Either of these two painful conditions require immediate medical attention Do not delay Tell you parents This may just be a common ANAL FISSURE most likely from a particularly large bowel movement very common when you are constipated They tend to break open over and over again after a subsequent bowel movement Since most young men would rather die than using the bathroom at school I see these quite offen in my Adolescent Clinic Get it checked out While you may experience a little embarrassment by having your butt checked this can get worse Why not get it checked while the problem is still minor and fixed by some ointment and stool softeners You are an official adult now so get you butt in gear so to speak and see a medical provider See a urologist You are having symptoms suggestive of prostatitis an infection or inflammation in the prostate gland I am not sure if there is a relationship with your boweldiarrhea and fatigue issues so this could easily be an entirely separate medical problem Making the diagnostic call requires an exam not something that can be accomplished over the Internet I pilonidal cystabscess is a possibility but so are other skin abscesses like sebaceous cysts I would suggest that you see a medical provider and have this painful area properly examined so you can have a definitive diagnosis and treatment plan You are in a real pickle if you excuse the pun I would suggest that you visit your friendly neighborhood ER and have a skilled medical professional remove it There is a strong possibility that the cucumber has lodged sideways creating a potentiallyserious condition Suppress your embarrassment and just go to the ER You are not the first person to do this You should always be concerned about chest pain but it would not be likely this would be related to your tetanus shot in any way I dont know anything about you  your age risk factors or anything about your medical history  so if you are concerned enough to post you should be concerned enough to see a medical provider  someone who has the ability to examine you and determine the reason for your chest pain and irritabiltiy Call his medical provider This is an easyfix with prescription medication Other family members may be at risk so dont be surprised to find others with similar symptoms You can get a tetanus shot at many pharmacies nowwithout a doctors visit Call around and I am sure you can find one so you will not have to wait Tetanus vaccines last about ten years tetanus is relatively rare in the United States but keeping your vaccine up day is VERY important since tetanus although rare is usually fata Get your vaccine as soon as you can A hemorrhoid is really a varicose vein in the circle of veins around your anal ring They can be inside the anus internal or outside external but not an inch away Your mass is something else but it would not be prudent to blindly guess You will need to be examined It could be cyst or even an abscess if it is tender but there are other possibilities Get it checked out You will need to have your family doctor examine you It would not be possible to blindly make a diagnostic determination without the ability to SEE and EXAMINE you The prostate is not visible on a routine examination and is can only be felt and examined by a trained medical professional since it is located a fingerlength up inside your rectum No You could have pinwormsthe live in your rectum and come out at night dont ask me how they know it is night and lay eggs around your anal ring This is one common cause of pruritis ani Latin for itchy anus You will need to have your medical provider order a pinworm test If this is not the cause then you will need to see your medical provider for an exam to see if their are other treatable reasons Nothing bad will happenthis is why an adult needs to keep track of those things Sexual hygiene is important for everyone to practice and many types of sexual activity can put you at risk for contracting an unwanted disease The anal area no matter how clean it may appear is awash in enteric organisms like E coli and enterobacter  potential pathogens that are part of the normal intestinal flora Exposure to these germs does not necessarily mean you will contract an illness but no one can dispute that the germs are there Of course there are plenty of different germs in the mouth that have diseasecausing potential as well Consential practices require a certain amount of consideration for the partner who may be at risk so thorough hygiene before contact is the very least that should be exercised There are many things that can cause an itchy anal area so your first step is to be properly examined and diagnosed Not wiping carefully after a bowel movement can result in irritation and this irritation can itch Soap residuals after bathing laundry detergents or perfumed dryer softener sheets can cause a chemical reaction around the anus Minor skin infections or anal fissures tiny cracks in the skin can itch And finally if you have close association with children pinworms are notorious for causing an itchy bottom Pinworms typically come out at night Each of these would have an individual treatment so having a correct diagnosis first is essential even if you are not enthusiastic about having your medical provider examine this area If you had a Tdap in 2013 the   in the dap is a tetanus vaccine that is good for ten years I dont think you will need another tetanus vaccine for quite a while Although tetanus is extremely rare in the US and even more rare from getting it from a utility knife cut the sooner you get the vaccine the better Tetanus vaccines last TEN YEARS so you may still have a viable immune response from a previous vaccine If the injection was given improperly it is very possible to involve nerves in this area Since it has been a month you should be examined by your medical provider or the place where you received the injection These could be pilonidal sinus TRACTS or openings based on your description These areas are capable of forming cysts or infections abscesses but as long as you are not having any problems just leave them alone If you are a male make sure to keep hair from these areas If your partner has HIV then you should be worried If you have no idea of your partners HIV status then you need to seriously reevaluate your risky sexual practices Condoms do protect from HIV if used properly HIV is more likely to be transmitted anally than orally If you are having stranger sex it would be best for you to be testedand tested again on a regular basis There is no way to calculate an individuals HIV risk from just one encounter but you did have some very risky sexunprotected open wound on penis bleeding female partner and someone whos sexual history is unknown I would strongly suggest that you see your medical provider so you can be properly examined and have STD testing especially for HIV It may just be an innocent skin tag quite common but unfortunately this would require an examination to confirm A description is really not sufficient to make a blind diagnosis Next time ask your medical professional during an examination in this area You will need to physically see a medical provider for this answera photo is not going to make the diagnosis See a medical provider so that you can be properly examined and treated There is really no way to make a blind determination as to the signficance of this tear fissure based soley on a very brief posting YesEcoli can be one of the possible pathogens since this bacteria quite prevalent in the neighborhood I dont believe there would be any contraindication to getting a pertussis vaccine as an adult but run it by your medical provider  someone who knows you and your complete medical history Sex toys can spread STDs so it would be wise to use new ones or ones that are carefully and thoroughly sanitized Herpes can remain viable on objects for many hours The fact that you and your partner BOTH have genital herpes would make me question if you are both virgins Someone may not be telling the whole truth You cannot get pregnant from anal sex nor can you become pregnant when you are not ovulating not likely four days after your period It is best that sperm be keep far away from your genitals area if you are trying to avoid pregnancy so I would suggest the use of condoms from now on Usually at six weeks the surgeon may give the okay for vaginal sex Assuming that your partner is well and painfree you may can probably get the okay from the surgeon by calling their office for patientspecific advice Anal sex should not be a contraindication Well we both know that it is not a clitoris even though I cant see it I suspec you either have a skin tag hemorrhoid or a polyp You will need to see your medical provider so you can have this mysterious growth properly identified Treatment would depend on your diagnosis Yes you may be at risk Having same sex anal intercourse without a condom puts you at risk if your partner has HIV Unless you saw his negative test results and knew the test results of ALL of his past partners and yours then you only have his word HIV can enter the body through microtears in the genital and anal area ejaculation is not relevant You will need to be tested retested and retested again Your boyfriend may be not be telling the truth Chlamydia is caused by exposure to someone else that has Chlamydiasimple as that Going from anal to vaginal sex can cause a severe bacterial infection from pathogens that live in the colon This is not a safe sexual practice Both you and your boyfriend need to be carefully tested since Chlamydia is often accompanied by other STDs Word to the Wise Use condoms with this guyand other guys too Anatomically there is really nothing you can do to change this close proximity other than being very careful not to contaminate the vagina with any germs from the anal area It is what it is A tetanus shot should still be administered She wont need another until she is 93 The tetanus vaccine is good for TEN YEARS but some medical providers will recommend a booster vaccine sooner than that if there is some doubt as to the previous date or if the wound is particularly prone The disease tetanus is very rare in the United States not so rare in other countries but if you should get it it has an extremely high fatality rate Getting a vaccine every ten years for 100 protection is really the best deal out there in the vaccine world Getting the vaccine 24 hours before a planned injury  is unlikely to be very effective unless of course you have prior immunity from a previous tetanus still on board Hemorrhoids can definitely bleed but if you are having bleeding from an area other than your anal ring it is from another source I suggest that you have a medical examination to determine the specific reason If you are going to be doing surgery at home with rusty scissors it woudl be best for you to get a tetanus shot These shots are good for ten years so it is not very likely this isolated event with the rusty scissors will cause you to get tetanus Yes It should not be a problem There are not egg or nut substances in this vaccine Nothis is not normal You may have a rectal prolapse I would suggest that you see a proctologist rectal specialist for an examination I do not think it is a good idea for you to Super Glue a surgical wound near your anus Please call your medical provider for patientspecific advice in this matter since I do not know the size of the wound how it was closed and when or the reason for the surgery in the first place There is no way for a medical provider to blindly answer that question without an examination I am sorry I would suggest that you call your medical provider  someone who knows you and your particular case  for advise in this matter Anal fissures are tiny tears or cracksthey do not typically have bubbles so I would be concerned about a cyst or abscess forming I do not know anything about you or your medical history not even your sex and I do not have any way of examining you over the Internet As much as I would like to help you you need more than just a blind guesssomeone needs to examine you to determine the causereason for your symptoms NoChlamydia is an STD sexuallytransmitted disease and that is how you got it He has cheated on you in past and probably lied about it so what makes you think he hasnt done it again It is not likely you got Chlamydia from sex toys but most likely from the boyfriend who has been toying around with someone else Assuming you are completely cured the answer would be no but it would still be wise to practice safe sex Since HPV can cause anal cancer it would be prudent for you to have a very careful cancerscreening examination on a regular basis by a proctologist or gastroenterologist This specialist would be the person who could give you a patientspecific answerthat you are diseasefree No You can not get pregnant from anal sex even if someone told you this is where attorneys come from Old joke If you are taking birth control PILLS you will not be ovulating You do realize that I have no way of examining you over the Internet  the only way to offer you a patientspecific answer Your description is just too vague for me to even guess if you have inflammatory skin tags Polyps Warts condylomata or hemorrhoids If you have had these things for four years perhaps it is time for you to be properly diagnosed Since your regular medical provider did not offer you an answer then seen a gastroenterologist or proctologist This is really their department I make it a personal rule not to look at these photos since a picture is never the same as a direct medical examination Common perianal lumps would likely be hemorrhoids or anal skin tags Other skin lesions like warts can also mysteriously appear in this sensitive area All have the tendency to bleed when irritated from bowel movements or wiping If you really want a definitive answer you to forego modesty and embarrassment and be properly examined by a medical professional To seasoned clinicians looking at your butt is no big deal But you do have bright red rectal bleeding which is NOT normal so like it or not you need to see your medical provider GI specialist or proctologist for an exam You may have fissure tear or an internal hemorrhoidone you cannot see with that hand mirror of yours Dont ignore this If the blood was bright red then it is likely from a hemorrhoid or fissure Darker olderlooking blood can be from higher up in the intestinal tract and black tarry blood is usually from the stomach Dont panic There is a good chance that this is an innocent finding but you will need to be examined to determine the exact source of the blood These may be tiny fissures or tears but this is just a blind guess since I cannot see it Fissures should heal in a week or so if you keep the area very clean and dry be careful when you towel dry it would be better to pat dry this area Use a topical antibiotic ointment and check the area periodically with a mirror to make sure it is not getting infected Make sure that your underwear is not irritating this sensitive area Wear more breathable cotton ones for now Should this area fail to heal or if you think it is getting worse you will need to see a medical provider i can feel it with my finger it appears to be stuck against the bone and i cant unstuck it for a lack of a better word yes It may be that your allergic to one of the minerals alone or a combination I was just unable to take any kind of pills while pregnant in all 5 pregnancies talk to your OB GYN or midwife for more Advice on what to do It is not likely so no I used to worry about things like that and I feel silly that i Had been worried Id say dont worry about it There are different things that can contribute to your bowels being upset It could be digestive issues gall bladder a parasitic issue colitis of some form If this continues I would reccommend you follow up with a gastroenterologist  I have suffered from these type issues myself and it was recommended to me to use a cap full of aloe Vera juice in whatever your drinking to help calm own the gasto track It helps but knowing the cause of the problem is always best Herpes doesnt travel around your body like that Certainly the genital and anal areas could be herpes but I would be very surprised if those on your torso are herpes If you wonder more you should have them swab tested when they appear Also herpes doesnt usually recur in the mouth but rather on the outside of the mouth Sores in the mouth are more often canker sores not caused by herpes virus This sounds like some of the symptoms I experience before I have an IBS irritable bowel syndrome attack my ability to regulate my body temp is poor I cramp I feel nauseous or faint and sometimes have loose or painful bowel movements If you dont have a history of IBS perhaps this is your bodys response to anal penetrationI know I feel a bit logy the few times after Ive done it Should be safe There for womens huhmmumm and if there safe enough for that then yeah should be safe for the anus Just dont forget to take it out at least every 8 hrsbut u have to use the bathroom between then so remove it before you end up stooling it outgross anyway just in every so you dont take it out every 8 hours you could be at chance for TSStoxic shock syndrome well I think the anus is up of TSS But I know this is your business with a tampon in the anus but why a tampon when I read this I was like omg this is a first sorry if I said something that may affended you tell me if it works out ahh nevermind Sources Female sounds like it might be a urinary tract infection A Pilonidal cyst after a certain time usually becomes infected or inflamed And can become hard to even set on it As it usually is located right on the tip of the tail bone And yes it can be surgically removed However is usually left open and has to heal from the inside out Involving sits baths and antibiotics I am surprised at the fact that you have all these diagnosis And test results But have not been treated for the symptoms It may just be a urinary tract infection I would revisit the Dr who gave you this imformation and results from your test And tell him or her that the problem still persist Have you tried an OTC Over the counter stool softener May solve your problem If not see your primary care Dr It could be TMJ Go see a dentist to confirm it I have the same pain in my jaw closer to my ear as well I also have really bad migraines due to it Hope i helped yes Id go see Dr Phil jk I wouldnt worry about it most likely you tore tissue in your rectum from masturbation as it appears to have been your first time Dont stress about it since it only happened once and was a little bit of blood and some people have phobias to that such as myself Maybe get some ky jelly or lube before you try again  I would see a natural pathic Dr a ND can tell you exactly to a tee what its from and if there is any issue they can get right to the root of it medical drs only know pharmaceutical drugs and will just say here take this and out you go See your primary care physician heshe may need to refer you to a specialist for colon testing none I will ask for help when I have this problem Thank you for assumption Yes the tests for celiac have a lot of reasons for potential false negatives  not eating gluten until right up to the test is one of them Your Anus is definitely not connected to your Vagina Two seperate openings two seperate functions Simply put no Could be just hemorrhoids have you been constipated If so than I would definitely call it hemorrhoids and it is very painful but the best way to help that that I have found is soaking in a hot bath the hottest that you can stand soak for a while than get it out But I would also just keep an eye out for it and if you realize its getting bigger and more painful than get a hold of a Doctor but I would think it would be hemorrhoids Couldnt see the pic had one of these bad boys myself 30 years ago but let me say bless you surgical revision is probably the best solution because not only does the doctor have to drain the cavity the lining needs to be removed too i am very sure techniquesprocedures have changed greatly since i had mine repaired but due to the location it is painful to have repaired i had to go back to the doctor weekly or every two weeks to have it cleaned out drained and repacked until it healed it is nasty as you probably know by now and it will be difficult to sit even with a doughnut pad going to the bathroom postop is another story fluids soft diet and stool softners help  yes as lng as your partner is not having a out break u should be fine HERBS people HERBS try mryhh or goldenseal tea wash with this and then sprinkle some of the herb on it and cover with bandaid or clean cloth Repeat if needed Read up on herbal remidies  library and or web or bookstore From personal experience this may or may not be the same thing youre dealing withI went to the dr for the same thing Apparently people have the Staph bacteria all over their body all the time and usually youre fine but sometimes the bacteria will get balsy or get into tiny openings in the skin and cause what feels like little cuts I was getting them inside my nose for not apparent reason and nothing gets rid of it and then it happened in the same place youre talking about I was prescribed Mupirocin and it went away in about 3 days How can I tell the difference between a haemorrhoid and an abscess if not medical maybe that is some inner thought that society has placed that anul massage during sex is forbidden an if so jusst speak with ur partner about this issue to talk make fix it You must refrain for a while to allow complete heaaling Usually six months is adequate I have found many non gay friendly providers feel you have to stop but there is not a good reason if full healing has taken place Now more aggressive forms or anal play may have to be stopped FF should of giving u more info about a week ago my friend and i w r having fun with her dildos she put one in my ass and now it keeps pulsing having a little trouble going to the bathroom and a little stomach pain  and bloated If this was my child I would take her to the doctors and shehe will probably give another DTP DiphtheriaTetanusPertussis shot just to be on the safe side Tetanus is a very very bad thing to get and is not so easily cured it has to run its course Best be on the safe side Same thing happened to my sister turned out she had a cist on her ovarie that burst during sex I am not an expert but I have a history of pain during intercourse mine was a severe case of endometreosis this is caused by scar tissue building up on our internal organs during our monthly cycle I would definitely check with your OBGYN doctor and they should hopefully be able to find what is causing this Hemorrhoid You probably have hemmoroids I had them and required surgery to have them removed after alternative therapy didnt work creams You need to discuss with your primary physician and he will probably refer you to an general lapro doctor Hope this helps Could be a cyst or boil or possible external hemorrhoid Keep area clean and eat plenty of fiber to ease BM If persist or worsens consult your family doctor If you masturbate frequently you may have accustomed yourself to the friction of your own hand Try varying your masturbation technique use lube to simulate a wet mouth use a lighter touch etc I would also add that if you are basing what you think your sexual response ought to be on images from pornography you may have the idea that all men can come from oral sex Keep in mind that even in pornography most of the men masturbate themselves to finish rather than finishing in their partners mouth "}
