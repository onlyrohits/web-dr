{"text": "I had same problem wneck Please go get Cat scan they blew it off cause I was too young to have Throat Cancer Well I just finished operation on inside of throat 29 treatments of chemotherapy and radiation for STAGE 4 THROAT CANCER FROM HPV Good luck A bulging disk can cause paralysis I would diffidently seek treatment it could be a bug go into the ear or a ugly ear infection you should take her to the doctor and have it looked at No I want to kill myself male breast IDENTICAL SYMPTOMS appeared in my ankle preceding a bite from a Black Widow spider in the topIfoot The actual bite she gave was ABSOLUTELY PAINLESS A bad sprain is more painful than a break i have experienced both you will recover faster if you use it carefully doing some walking and assisted standing while holding a support a few times a day Progress from here Do not lay in bed for a year It could be that your period is about to start soon Cramps can occur before the period actually starts If you dont think its the right time for your period to be starting soon and it doesnt go away after a few days it could be something more serious Ovarian cancer is one of the possiblities so you may need to get it checked At least put up your both feets at a horizontal way with some cusion to help it should lower your swelling Yes RA can cause a lot of problems I would get it checked as soon as possible before it gets any worse It can just being something small and simple and an easy fix But definitely get it checked Although you sound confident that this most recent incident is just a bad bug bite I would worry about the possibility of cellulitis since swelling and redness are common to both and cellulitis can start with just a bite I would err on the side of going to see your doctor Another possibility is speaking with him or her on the phone and ask if he or she is willing to view a good quality photo sent by email An infection in this area cannot be ignored Swelling in mostly across toes and top of foot and fingers Keep gargling with hot water with salt added You could also keep drinking lemon juice mixed to warm water and add honey insead of sugar You could have green tea with honey Keep having warm soup and water Take care May be gout if it is near the joint Not a doc but strep usually presents with red swollen lymphs and while spots Have no idea what your daughter has but would take her to doc post haste  does she have any other symptoms  fever blurred vision redness or yellowing skin other enlarged lymph nodes in the body etc  if thats the case child should probably go immediately to emergency room I know from my own experience with arthritis that your complaint sounds very much like arthritis You should however see a Dr for it as there is a difference between Osteoarthritis and Rhuematoid Arthritis Either way a true Dx should be made  Inguinal lymph nodes are located bilaterally in the area of the groin The presence of lymph nodes throughout the body is a normal anatomical feature for both men and women The physiological function of inguinal lymph nodes is to filter lymphatic material that channels to the groin areas the feet the legs and the genitals During periods of infection the lymph nodes can be overburdened doing the work of cleaning the body of debris and become enlarged usually the lymph nodes are about the size of an eraser head Due to the location of an enlarged inguinal lymph node I knew someone with one the size of a golf ball the swelling can be uncomfortable reddened and sometimes painful Due to the body attempting to fightoff an infection the patient may have a fever and not feel well Yes any bodily infection including jock itch and yeast infections can cause the lymph nodes to enlarge somewhat But there are other possible causes including a cyst may be benign infections of the legs feet and groin areas sexually transmitted diseases cancer rarely and allergic reactions If the lymph node has not returned to its normal eraser head size within the 7 day period following the start of antibiotic treatment I would suggest that you follow back with the doctor for further evaluation Sometimes a 2nd round of antibiotics is needed or a different antibiotic may be required Occasionally the lymph node is biopsied to ruleout cancer andor to determine the best antibiotic to treat the enlarged lymph node I hope that this answer has been helpful and that you feel better soon  A certain amount of edema tissue fluid buildup in the arms hands ankles and feet is a normal occurrence for a woman in her 3rd trimester of pregnancy Drinking additional amounts of water can be a helpful form of treatment for your edematous condition  I recommend that you contact your doctor about the swelling of your face and puffiness around your eyes It is important to eliminate a serious medical condition as the cause for your facial and eye symptoms One of those serious medical conditions is called preeclampsia Preeclampsia can cause a spike in blood pressure and result in kidney function irregularities Conclusion Most women experience swelling of the arms hands legs ankles and feet during pregnancy A sudden swelling of the face and puffiness around the eyes should be assessed by a medical professional I hope that this answer has been helpfulBest wishes for the upcoming birth of your child May labor and delivery be a positive experience full of joy It is certainly possible to miss a fracture on xray examination Another possibility is that you did not sustain a fracture but instead a bone bruise  I had bruised ribs after a base runner slid into to me hard with his head at 3rd base and blindsided me I had been looking towards the outfielder for the ball being relayed from leftfield A bone bruise can cause more pain than a fracture and last for up to six months With severe bone bruising the pain may continue for even longer than 6 months A bone bruise is usually caused by some sort of violent collision to a bone such as you describe There may be damage to the outer surface of the bone resulting in bleeding seeping into areas around the bone accompanied by discoloration pain and stiffness Although I suspect bone bruising in your case a swollen ankle lasting for 2 months should be reexamined by a physician Lets look at the first part of your question Yes medications can remain in the system for hours and days after taking your final dose As a matter of fact I am still experiencing some residual allergic reactions from the medication Bactrim 3 days after taking the final dose The 2nd part of your posting questions whether Keflex caused allergy symptoms 5 days after you took the final dose The answer is most likely no and heres why Keflex an antibiotic is excreted by the kidneys and has a relatively short half life of less than an hour 09 hours The half life represents the time necessary for half of the drug to leave your system some people may experience a more delayed drug half life if they took Keflex with milk or have kidney disturbances After 1 or 2 days of having taken the last dose all of the Keflex should have left your system  10K 20K is a big price range and although very expensive it could be the going rate depending on some variables There can be a big difference in medical procedure costs based upon the geographical area of the country the person who is doing the procedure the exact type of epidural procedure and the facility where the procedure will be preformed The costs are typically lower when preformed in a doctors office but that savings comes with additional risks for medical complications Of course large medical insurance carriers can negotiate the costs of procedures significantly lower to what is referred to as Usual  Customary Charges wherein a noninsured individual pays the highest rates I see a common range for the epidural procedure to be between 3000  7000 It is probably in your best interest to contact multiple providers for this procedure in your area and compare prices Some large hospitals make available as public information on their web site the average charge for most procedures  In order to eliminate products that may be adversely affecting your daughter she needs to continue with her current daily routine I recommend that you begin to keep a journal to document all of your daughters daily activities Note all meals  snacks  fluids ingested and all medications taken Reference the time and date of each activity Also note other activities of daily living including playtime computer time television time and bathing List the environmental location where the activity occurred car yard bedroom school etc Every single product used by your daughter also should be listed crayons soaps bubble bath detergents etc When your daughter has another allergic reaction the incident should be annotated completely as to time place duration and describe accurately the observed event After a short period of time you should look for obvious patterns associated with the allergic reaction You may want to take your daughter to see an allergist bring the journal with you to the appointment who can also do blood testing that will reveal the offending agent Your investment of time in documenting your daughters daily activities should be rewarded by providing you with the correct allergen responsible for the negative reaction It means that your liver is struggling to perform its duties according to your bodys requirements to regulate glycogen and filter toxins Skin discoloration may appear yellowish or jaundice and leg swelling are classic symptoms of liver cirrhosis Bleeding easily increase of blood pressure portal hypertension abdominal swelling ascites and itchy skin are other symptoms Since you have been diagnosed with cirrhosis hopefully the swelling and discoloration symptoms were explained to you in detail I suggest that you notify your hepatic specialist of any changes in your symptoms The sooner that new indicators of the disease have been treated the better the eventual outcome tends to be Best wishes for your recovery Some common causes for your three noted symptoms viewed in a collective manner may include Crohns Disease Hypothyroidism Kidney Disorder and Urinary Tract Obstruction Of course may other conditions may be the root of your problems Looking at your symptoms

individual can exam you question you look at your medical history do preliminary testing and refer you to other specialist if needed Many of the over the counter pain relievers contain at least some common ingredients Since you do not really know which ingredient in these medications is causing the negative sideeffects it may be a good idea to discuss the reactions with the family doctor and to be referred to an allergist specialist Its really not the that she is reacting to but instead at least one of its ingredients Another valuable source of information is the neighborhood pharmacist This individual if the sideeffect is frequently seen in  may be familiar with the ingredient responsible for the negative reactions  Swollen neck lymph nodes may be the result of an infection inflammation cancer or viruses In your case it is suspected that your recent cold is the cause of the enlarged neck lymph node Treatment is dependent on the cause with bacterial infections possibly needing antibiotics a virus needing to run its course and cancers being attacked with multiple individualized treatments The link below will access a WebMd article on the topic of lymph nodes httpwwwwebmdcomatozguidesswollenlymphnodestopicoverviewwwparam1307921683  t Well you should bring her to the doctor I had a tick on my armpit once and the doctor was a big help he dug the whole tick out YES it is usually yeast and can make your tongue very sore and sensitive and the back of your throat too take a look if you see it red or white ask your doctor for something for thrush and it will feel better in a few days If you have had this for 5 days or more see your doc asap It could be many different things and out little lymph nodes seem to be the first thing we notice when other things are wrong The list is too long to even guess so see your doctor and never ignore any swollen glands they are swollen for a reason ever notice that is some of the very first things a doctor or nurse as myself will check when you come to the office Make an appt let me know how it goes If you have a primary care doc go see him or her it may be yeast or just a rash Could be as simple as the type of material you wear in your underwear or have you changed soaps in your laundry Or changed the kind of soap you wash your body with Be sure to keep the area clean and dry and wear loose fitting pants around the house to let it get air I would try some cortisone cream to see if you get relief if not then you might want to see a dermatologist to rule out other skin infections Been to the beach lately Sometimes sand mites and fleas can cause this type of thing if the beach is a no then see a doctor or at least one online First I HATE CANCER My daughter has it and I am a nurse so I know what she is going thru Is your brother a small person or a large person I only ask because I would think that if the testicles are not hurting too much he may just could wear a larger size of some really soft boxerbriefs they would feel soft on the skin and yet give some gentle support without feeling so constricted Right now if he was here I could fashion him something that would be comfy but not knowing it is hard for me to say If you have a mom or a grandma maybe fashion some sort of sling that would have some soft wide elastic at the top and then the fabric attached to the front and the back going under the scrotum holding them softly up a little so they dont hang and hurt him when he is up and walking or even just sitting in a chair I can see it in my mind so clear I know it would work Use some sheep skin material for the supporter that would attach to the wider elastic band that would go around him and thru his legs and connect to the back Then all he would have to do is just step into it and pull it up GOSH I hope someone in your family can sew this would be so great for him I hope this helped this brave guy some Blessings and be well I had total knee surgery twice First the left knee and then the right My doctor gave me the correct excersizes to do thank heavens In comparison to some other people I had spoken with what I did was right I had the physical therapist come to the house for the first time And you  MUST DO THESE EXCERCISES TWICE A DAY WHETHER YOU FEEL LIKE IT OR NOT  30 minutes before you start excercizing you take your pain pill Then lay flat and start leg raises one leg at a time Keep stiff leg and work to get that leg as high up as you can Then do peddling a bicycle with the little 2 foot high bike you can get at a medical store to rent Or maybe you can do that laying down and peddle like a bike with both legs Try it Dont baby yourself I was given a long strip of plastic like a strip of inertube and you put that under the ball of your foot of the affected knee sit straight up and pull it tight with both hands and press down like you are stepping on a gas pedal in the carKeep your leg straight and the rubber tight Eventually you will have to lift some sort of weight with your legSit in a chair and tie something to your ankle like a can of something heavy in something you can put around the ankle to hold it as the weightRrAISE SLOWLY RELEASE SLOWLY RAISE SLOWLY RELEASE SLOWLY These are some of the excersizes I did But when you are done doing all of these put an ice bag on the knee for about 20 minutes Rest YOU MUST UNDERSTAND IF YOU DO NOT DO THE EXERCIZES YOUR DOCTOR GAVE YOUYOU WILL END UP LIKE YOU ARE By this time you should be well on the way to no pain and swelling The ice bag after therapy is probably the answer for you But going to therapy out of the house will stop you from taking you pain pill before you start I would guess Just that little help to ease the pain will make you work harder You might do better doing all your therapy at home using the pain pill and ice packs I hope this might help you You didnt state what you therapy involved  Then you progress from 2 crutches to one crutch on the opposite side of the bad knee From that you go to a cane NO WALKER Its something I would call his pediatrician about A physical exam can help rule out more serious causes of breast development in a boy and ease your mind During puberty as in other stages of life it is not uncommon to see breast development in men For example a newborn baby boy can have some degree of breast development which can be completely normal Its due to exposure to estrogen from the mother or the placenta during development A health aging male can also have some degree of breast development and this would not necessarily signal a serious medical problem These are settings in which the hormone estrogen stimulates breast development About 40 of adolescent boys develop some degree of breast developmentnot to be confused with breast enlargement because of fatty tissue You might see one or both breast develop or a boy might complain of breast tenderness This usually resolves as the transition and hormonal changes of puberty are established Certainly take you son to see his doctor as there can be other more serious reasons for breast development in boys And while a physical exam may help reveal the answer he may also need some type of breast imaging and blood test to help determine the cause I too am on blood pressure medicine and am very swollen in the legs ankles feet hands and fingers Not so sure that my belly isnt swollen somewhat I just read on WebMD that increasing water and cutting down on sodium and exercising is a big help I just wanted to add that I am on 2 mood stabilizers and was told that the family of drugs can be a reason for retaining fluid One of the side effects is weight gain so yay  Check all of the medicines that you take to see the side effects and then report this to your doctor like I did He cut my medicine in half Im afraid because these meds can also raise my cholesterol and my liver function which are culprits for edema as well I think Are either of you allergic to other meds Seems like my body has changed and am having allergic reactions to Chantix and Cipro and have been allergic to NSAIDS since 2005 had to go to the hospital because of the swelling in my throat  tongue Ive never had food or drug allergies before Ive also been told that Im menopausal now and that could be part of my weightgain problem but I think a lot of it is swelling Hope that we all get the swelling under control its very aggravating and causes pain in those areas after a while Wow  sounds like some form of edema  I would definitely have her see a doctor Soon There are promising new treatments that are being developed using stem cells to stimulate cartiledge growth Your orthopedic surgeon is focused on surgery so he probably wont mention this and may not know about it After having one successful knee replacement arthritis Im biding my time till this treatment becomes available for the other knee First make an appointment with your doctor as it is probably pink eye which is contagious A warm tea bag placed on the eye with eye closed of course helps with crustys that may form and will also help with the excess of mucusand timepatience is needed as this may last up to 7 days Your best option for pain relief would be minor surgery If you have a high tolerance for pain you might benefit from physical therapy yesand sometimes all he way around the whole eye it is almost five months now since i order a pregnancy spell cast on me on Facebook Oduduwa Ajakaye i saw in a website on how he help a couple to get pregnant and i contacted him which i started seeing changes on my body since the first week of last 4 months and i am 18 weeks gone and i am carrying my own baby in my womb i am so happy that i finally got pregnant after all i have been through contact him for any problems you are having he will surely provide you a solution All thanks be to him it is almost five months now since i order a pregnancy spell cast on me on Facebook Oduduwa Ajakaye i saw in a website on how he help a couple to get pregnant and i contacted him which i started seeing changes on my body since the first week of last 4 months and i am 18 weeks gone and i am carrying my own baby in my womb i am so happy that i finally got pregnant after all i have been through contact him for any problems you are having he will surely provide you a solution All thanks be to him As for the valtrex Im not an expert or anything it is important that you definitely need to check with the doc and make sure that there is no danger in you NOT taking the meds They may still require you to take them Obviously none of us are medical experts so all I can tell you is my opinion on what I would dothink if I were in your situation What did she eatShe may have an allergic reactionWhen she sleeps keep her head propped up so she dont risk the chance of choking A definite break Sounds like you may have the beginning stage of a sty Stys are normally found under the eye lid or along the eye lash area When I get a sty I take a small amount of rice and put it into a baggie and place the open baggie with a wash cloth under the baggie into the microwave heat it for one minute Remove the baggie and wash cloth seal the baggie then fold the wash cloth around the baggie this will be hot if you wish wrap another wash cloth around the baggie and first wash cloth to avoid burning yourself Apply to your eye to help with the swelling and help the sty to come to a head so it can pop on its own Do not try and pop a sty as this could lead to infection and a longer period of time to heal Allow the sty to pop on its own always If need be see your doctor if the swelling gets worse or is still swollen for more than a week Do you still have your appendix If so you should go to the ER Im sorry to hear what youre going through Its probably rather alarming Some swelling of the feet and ankles is common with pregnancy However if you have been diagnosed with and this swelling is new I would suggest you contact your OBGYN to let him or her know of this development The fluid retention in your lower limbs may be nothing to worry about And then again it might be Your best bet is to not try diagnosing this yourself Let your doctor do it If youve been diagnosed with preeclampsia and experience sudden swelling of the hands arms or face then you should contact your doctor right away Wishing you and your baby well If youre so weak you truly feel almost lifeless you really need to seek immediate medical attention Any number of things could cause you to experience sharp stomach pains but an inability to eat combined with extreme weakness is cause for alarm Please have someone take you to the emergency room or call for an ambulance Im sorry youre going through this and wish you all the best The short answer is this Yes you should see a doctor You could have a cyst a lipoma or something else Your best bet is to have this examined by an appropriate health care provider such as a dermatologist though you can simply go see your primary care provider if necessary Unfortunately we cant diagnose a skin lesion like this via the internet And if its an infected cyst or something youll need to have it drained because it wont clear up on its own Best to you Assuming you havent traveled to any thirdworld countries recently its highly unlikely you have a parasite in your gums Its much more likely you have something lodged in there such as a popcorn hull If your gum is very swollen it naturally is going to move yield when you push on it with your finger If the swelling is caused by an  then you could feel fluid moving around under the skin If the situation doesnt clear up on its own within a couple of days or if you begin experiencing severe pain a high fever andor discharge from the swollen area then a trip to the dentist is in order Wishing you well Im sorry to hear about your accident Its always painful to injure the ankle Unfortunately its impossible to diagnose a broken bone without Xrays Even in an exam room a medical provider may not be able to tell by looking if the ankle is broken or not The fact you can put your full weight on the joint and have good range of motion makes me think its probably just sprained If the swelling goes down and the pain decreases then you can be pretty sure it was just a sprain The bruising may take quite awhile to clear up and the joint may be painful for some time Soft tissue injuries can take awhile to heal completely If youre still having trouble with the foot after a week to 10 days then it would be worth seeing a doctor Perhaps he or she will want to get an Xray simply to rule out any fractures Wishing you well It sounds like youre saying your friend was removed from life support and if so Im very sorry for your loss Im sure the family did not make the decision to remove the ventilator without a lot of input from the doctors caring for your friend A family cannot unilaterally decide to withdraw life support Ultimately that decision is made mutually between the care team and the loved ones Regarding pain You may not be able to feel pain if youre unconscious but pain causes a physical reaction in the body This is one way we can tell if an unconscious patient is experiencing pain As you noted high blood pressure and agitation can be symptoms of pain I encountered this frequently as a recovery room nurse when my patients were still asleep after surgery but obviously were experiencing a pain response To set your mind at ease about the withdrawal of life support let me just say some brain injuries cannot be overcome Brain tissue cannot repair itself the way most other body tissues can For example you get a cut on your finger and eventually skin cells fill in the gap It doesnt work like that in the brain or the heart for that matter When brain cells die they are dead forever If your friends doctors felt he was brain dead it means he never would have recovered no matter how much time he was given Again Im sorry for your loss Im sorry to hear youre going through this It sounds very unpleasant First just to clarify an IUD is an intrauterine device Its an implant that goes inside the uterus I think what you meant to say is you had birth control implants rods removed from your upper arm You dont say when you had this procedure done but its not unexpected you would experience bruising possibly considerable bruising since the inside of the upper arm is a very tender area and pain for the same reason You also would experience swelling which is a normal response to having a minor procedure like the rod removal Its also not abnormal for the stitches to ooze for the first 24 hours after you have the birth control rods taken out Your health care provider should have given you some instructions about what to do regarding the stitches sutures Generally speaking you should be able to Gently cleanse the stitches using lukewarm water and plain soap pat dry Apply an antibacterial ointment such as triple antibiotic ointment or Neosporin to the sutures as long as youre not allergic to any of the ingredients in the ointment Many people fear any wound will become infected so they monitor closely for what they believe is pus coming from the wound Usually any fluid you see oozing from a wound is not pus but is simply part of the natural healing process It takes several days for an infection to develop so if you just had the birth control rods removed today it would be virtually impossible for you to be experiencing symptoms of an infection where the rods were removed If it has been more than three days since you had the rods removed and youre experiencing symptoms the next step is to take your temperature using a thermometer  If you have a fever over 101F then you may indeed have an infection You should seek medical treatment In general you can elevate your arm apply ice packs and take an overthecounter pain reliever to help ease the situation At any rate if youre concerned about whats going on you should contact the health care provider who removed the birth control rods He or she is in the best position to advise you how to proceed Wishing you well Im not trying to alarm you but you need to seek immediate medical attention Although you have a family history of COPD the symptoms you describe point to something else  a heart issue The GOOD NEWS is most heart issues can be wellmanaged over the long term with early diagnosis and treatment I urge you to have a friend drive you to the emergency room You need to get yourself into the hands of medical professionals Wishing you well Im sorry youre going through this Its always scary when we have a problem with our eyes The first thing to clarify is this Is it your actual eyeball thats twitching Or is it your eyeLID Twitching of the eyelid is called and is quite common It tends to come and go as you described It can get worse and more frequent from time to time and then clear up for long periods Stress fatigue and caffeine are common culprits of blepharospasm If its your eyeball thats twitching that would be more worrisome to me When a persons eyeballs twitch its usually both of them If your eyeball itself is the problem Id advise you to see a doctor I realize you said you dont have insurance but most communities have free or lowcost health care clinics You could start by getting checked at one of those just to calm any fears you may have about this situation I wish you all the best Well thats a good question Have you had your ankle examined by a health care professional or are you diagnosing this as a sprain on your own Because your symptoms could be caused by a  for sure but also by a fracture break in the ankle or the leg So Id recommend you see a doctor as soon as possible to have the ankle examined Your health care provider may want to take an Xray to make sure nothing is broken The symptoms you describe can be a normal part of the bodys healing process When we injure tissue the body sends a big healing response to the damaged area Various cells march into action and these can cause the tissue to temporarily become hot and swollen The pain is caused by nerves that have been irritated or injured With any injury like the one youre describing we recommend you elevate the injured area and apply ice packs Do not place ice packs directly against the skin use a towel or something in between The usual recommendation is 20 minutes of ice then 20 minutes with no ice However I again want to caution you to get examined by a doctor to make sure you havent broken or dislocated a bone So sorry youre hurting I hope you get some relief soon This is something that deserves to be checked out right away by a health care professional especially if your vision is changed or limited in your right eye Its possible to rupture a blood vessel in the white of the eye called  This can be triggered by something as simple as sneezing Occasionally there is pain involved as well as mild swelling of the eyelid Its not possible to diagnose your eye problem in a forum like this because you need someone to conduct a physical examination to see whats going on Chances are youre experiencing a subconjunctival hemmorhage which usually is benign doesnt cause any harm But youll want a health care provider to tell you that in person Good luck to you This certainly merits a call to the pediatrician He or she may want to examine your son to discover whats going on here Diarrhea shouldnt cause the scrotum to swell This symptom may be completely unrelated to the diarrhea or there could be some sort of injury to the childs testes that is causing the diarrhea Either way you want to get this assessed Id suggest you call your pediatrician as soon as possible Meanwhile keep your son hydrated by providing plenty of fluids Wishing you all the best I think you should get this looked at Whatever is causing the problem its not normal You may want to gently inspect the position of the  It should naturally cover the head of the penis the glans You should never pull the foreskin back on a boy younger than about age 5 not even to clean At age 2 you can easily damage your sons penis by forcibly retracting pulling back the foreskin At any rate a red swollen painful penis in a child is not something to take lightly Id suggest you put a call in to his pediatrician as soon as possible Best wishes to you both Sorry to hear youre experiencing this It must be uncomfortable Its really impossible to say what could be causing this without a physical examination Your best bet is to make an appointment with your primary care provider and let him or her take a look at your toe Because the range of possible causes is so wide and depends a lot on your physical history medications and so on only your health care provider can provide a diagnosis I hope youre able to get this resolved quickly Im sorry youre going through this but Im glad to see youre so vigilant about your breast health Way to go First let me say breast cancer in a 16yearold is exceedingly rare I want to put your mind at ease about that The problem is likely something far less serious It wouldnt hurt to get this situation checked out by your doctor or nurse practitioner It could be related to hormones because of course they fluctuate or something else thats very simple such as circulation issues Even if the situation clears up over the next few days Id suggest you get this looked at Youll feel less anxious and your doctor will get the condition into your medical history in case it occurs again Wishing you well Id suggest you see a doctor about this You can start with your primary care provider and he or she will refer you to an orthopedic doctor if necessary You dont say exactly what kind of surgery you had in 2009 Im thinking it was an arthroscopy to remove pieces of the meniscus If this is the case and youre experiencing new or worsening symptoms youd be well served to see a health care provider I wouldnt necessarily recommend wearing a knee brace You could reduce your range of motion and have a hard time getting it back The only way to truly solve this problem is to get an examination by a health care provider He or she can discuss with you all the various options from physical therapy to surgery that can help solve your knee problem Good luck Youre wise to ask questions like this I suggest you ask them directly of the medical professional who is treating you Your questions are legitimate and you can be assure your physician will give you straight answers In general Botox botulinumtoxinA has a good safety track record To my knowledge there are no reported instances where it has caused anaphylaxis or has traveled throughout the body though this has been reported with other botulinumtoxin products One of your concerns is about having repeated injections There are two issues to that aspect of your question First is that no one develops an allergy to a substance on the first exposure The major symptoms you describe anaphylaxis breathing issues are related to major allergic reactions If youve had three injections without an allergic response then you probably dont need to fear an allergic reaction at this point The other thing about the issue of repeated injections is that Botox only remains active for about 90 days After three months the botulinumtoxin has been fully metabolized by the body So youre not adding on to the amount of Botox in your system Youre replenishing it After the botulinumtoxin exits your system it no longer works Unless you get another dose your lazy eye problem will return Keep in mind I am not a physician As I said at the beginning you should address all of your concerns with the doctor who is treating you with Botox He or she will welcome your questions Wishing you well I suggest you contact your surgeon immediately While scrotal edema swelling of the sac that holds the testicles after is not necessarily uncommon the fact its occurring 5 days postoperatively and seems to be linked to some sort of painful activity means the swelling may not be normal in your case You dont say if you ejaculated via intercourse or masturbation If you had intercourse just 5 days after inguinal hernia repair surgery you may have caused too much strain on the sutures and ruptured them which is what may be causing your scrotum to swell If you ejaculated through masturbation you still may have somehow disrupted the internal repair Your best bet is to call your surgeons office to report this or make an appointment Dont be ashamed to tell the receptionist youre experiencing scrotal swelling with pain You dont have to tell them over the phone how this happened but you should be frank with your surgeon in order for him or her to provide you with the best care Hope this helps Im sorry youre going through this As a former plastic surgery nurse Ive worked with many young men who have the issues you describe Id like to suggest you get your parents to take you for a visit to your primary care provider You can request to be seen privately without your parent in the room if that would make you more comfortable Show your health care provider your chest so he or she can determine if you have a condition called  Its not uncommon in young men Gynecomastia is an overgrowth of breast tissue in boys It can be caused by the hormonal changes of puberty If your health care provider suspects you have gynecomastia he or she may run a few blood tests to check your hormone levels Gynecomastia is treated with surgery Generally a small incision is made around the nipple and the excess breast tissue is removed A few stitches close the incision Of course other conditions can cause enlarged breasts in adolescent boys Your health care provider can make an accurate diagnosis and get you the appropriate care or treatment Best wishes to you Sorry to hear youre experiencing this It sounds unpleasant Youre right It could be  It could also be something entirely different  for example can cause a tinglingprickly sensation to the toes The only way to determine for sure whats causing your symptoms is a physical examination by a health care provider And even then you might not get an answer to your question Why Because there are so many possible causes for the symptoms you describe Unless or until you experience additional symptoms a physician may not be able to pinpoint exactly whats causing the toe tingling One things for sure The only way to begin figuring this out is to see a health care provider Id suggest you start with your primary care provider Wishing you well Im sorry to hear youre going through this It sounds awful First thing WASH YOUR HANDS very thoroughly before and after touching that eye In the event it turns out you have pinkeye you can easily spread it to others with your fingers Plus you dont want to contaminate your ailing eye with any other germs when you touch it Second what youre describing is not normal There are several possible explanations for your swollen eye but you need an examination by a medical professional to get a diagnosis If the swelling and gunk are confined to just one eye it could be a symptom of a foreign body in the eye  so Never take chances with your vision I suggest you either go to urgent care or make an appointment as soon as possible with your primary care provider Wishing you well You should get medical attention for your brother as soon as possible These symptoms could relate to a variety of ailments and only a health care professional doing a physical examination can give you a diagnosis Any time a persons symptoms get worse or change suddenly its worth a trip to the doctors office In your brothers case this is especially true because his symptoms are causing him to be unable to walk I dont want to alarm you but I urge you to seek medical attention for your brother as soon as possible Best wishes to you both Sorry youre experiencing this Do you know what is causing the swelling For instance did you injure your knee in some way Or did it suddenly just balloon up Do you have a prosthetic knee knee replacement The reason I ask is because any of those things could cause swelling and the treatment might be different for each cause Youre doing the right thing by elevating your knee The ice is probably OK if you think the swelling is due to an injury Otherwise the ice is probably useless And at that ice generally is only indicated for a few days postinjury If this is a chronic problem youve had it happen before or if it doesnt clear up within a few days or if the swelling is accompanied by redness and heat in the joint plus a fever then Id suggest you seek medical attention Hope this helps and you feel better soon Sorry youre dealing with this I definitely would have these new symptoms checked out There may be some causeeffect between the strep and the swollen painful joints or you may have developed something else entirely At any rate the sudden onset of the symptoms you describe in an otherwise healthy young female is reason enough to seek medical care right away Your best bet is to return to the urgent care facility where you received the strep test and injection because theyll have your medical records at hand Normally I wouldnt advise someone who believes they have strep throat to seek urgent care Its something that can be handled by a primary care provider Take care and best wishes Im sorry to hear youre going through this Unfortunately its impossible to say what could be causing this without a physical examination I suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider as soon as possible because the earlier this problem is diagnosed the better the outlook for treating it effectively Youre doing a wonderful service in caring for a disabled child I salute you and hope you get a diagnosis soon Im sorry to hear this can be very painful I hope youre under the care and treatment of a doctor because cellulitis requires antibiotics to be cured Cellulitis is a bacterial infection that gets through the skin and into the underlying tissue areas Depending on how severe the case of cellulitis is a patient may receive oral antibiotics or have to go into the hospital for a course of intravenous IV antibiotics Unfortunately theres little you can do to help the swelling go down You can try keeping the hand and wrist elevated which might help some In terms of pain control please check with your health care provider to find out if its OK for you to take overthecounter pain relievers or if a prescription pain reliever may be in order If the pain gets worse instead of better or if the swelling begins to move up your arm then you need to call your health care provider as soon as possible This could be an indication you need more aggressive treatment I wish you all the best Gotta love a person who admits she has a short fuse and a hot temper Id suggest you make an appointment with a medical professional for a physical examination When you push down on your shin bone and the skin stays indented that is a sign of fluid retention in the legs This symptom combined with your shortness of breath warrants a checkup It might just be that you need to cut back on salt But it could also be sort of an early warning sign of additional heart problems besides your mitral valve regurgitation It wouldnt be a bad idea to get this checked out so if it is something with your heart youve caught it early Wishing you and your temper all the best Im sorry you experienced this and hope it has cleared up by now Rashes can be caused by many things One important thing to remember is this If a rash is accompanied by swelling of the throat or difficulty breathing its time to call 911 These could be the symptoms of a rare lifethreatening  Luckily most rashes are not lifethreatening This can be helpful in figuring out whats going on with you If your rash has not gotten better by now your best bet is to see a doctor He or she can help figure out whats going on and treat it if necessary Best wishes to you Unfortunately your question is lacking crucial information to provide a good answer How old is your son Has he received routine childhood vaccines Enlarged lymph nodes can signal a variety of potential conditions Your best bet is to take your son to his pediatrician for an exam If your son has not been immunized against the MMR vaccine you definitely should seek medical attention Mumps in a young man generally older than age 10 can cause a related condition called  which is swelling of the testicles This can cause fertility problems down the road Regardless of your sons immunization status having enlarged lymph nodes is not normal and you should seek medical attention If your son is running a high fever you should seek emergency medical treatment Wishing you well Im sorry youre going through this It sounds unnerving Unfortunately theres no way to diagnose this problem without doing a physical exam Many things could cause such swelling from a serious sinus infection to an abscessed tooth Your best bet is to contact your health care provider for an appointment as soon as possible If you begin to have severe pain or start running a fever over 101F then you may want to consider visiting an urgent care facility to get this checked out I wish you all the best and hope you feel better soon What youre experiencing sounds awful I hope you get some relief soon I strongly suggest you see a health care provider to evaluate these symptoms Sometimes things like leg pains in children dont need to be treated but youre an adult now and still have the pain That definitely deserves to be looked at The may or may not be related to the leg pain Anyone can develop migraines Many people believe they have migraines when they actually have common headaches Migraines are a very specific type of headache that requires special treatment Only a health care provider can tell you if you are getting true migraines or not Again I urge you to see a health care provider about this And I wish you all the best Even in women with regular periods what youre describing can be normal Sometimes our bodies hiccup a little bit Maybe thats what youre experiencing Other things to consider Have you recently had unprotected sex could you be pregnant Its possible to have a very light period right after becoming pregnant So if pregnancy is a possibility Id suggest you take a home pregnancy test At the other end of the spectrum is it possible youre premenopausal This could be another explanation for your unusual period this month If neither of these scenarios apply to you youre probably safe to wait and see what happens next month If everything proceeds as normal then youre good to go Hope this helps Im sorry to hear youre going through this My concern is that you dont have at all Normally shingles isnt described as hives all over the body that itch In fact if you have welts on both sides of your body as divided by the spinal column then I can guarantee you do not have shingles Shingles only affects  Even though you dont currently have health insurance Id suggest you find a way to get checked out by a medical professional preferably when youre having an outbreak of these hives Most communities have free or lowcost medical clinics to serve people who have no insurance You can locate one of these clinics near you by calling your local Medicaid office or by performing an internet search for free health clinic and your city name I wish you all the best at finding a solution to this annoying condition Hi As a former plastic surgery nurse I feel uniquely qualified to answer your question  Its not uncommon for a woman especially one like yourself who considers herself a natural type person to feel uncomfortable physically and psychologically with her enhanced breasts in the time period immediately following the surgery In my experience this discomfort goes away pretty quickly as you get used to the new breasts When I was a plastic surgery nurse the surgeon I worked for always advised women to wait at least 3 months before making a decision about the size or removal of implants At the threemonth mark virtually all of the swelling has gone away and youve had time to adjust to your new look I can tell you in my experience none of our clients who felt as you do opted to have their implants removed once they got used to them I hope this helps ease your mind Youre still recovering so be kind to yourself and give both your body and your emotions time to cope with this surgery Best wishes to you Im sorry to hear this It sounds at the very least annoying Without more details its impossible to tell whats going on here If the swelling and redness is confined to the small area between the eyes it could be caused by anything from a mosquito bite to a pimple and dont cause swelling but they do cause flaky patches that could look raised or welted If the symptoms dont get better you certainly can take your mother to her primary care provider to have this looked at I hope your mom feels better soon Im not sure what that is but it sounds very unpleasant Id suggest you see a dentist for an examination The bump youre describing could be anything from a skin ulcer to an to an  A dentist can evaluate the situation and tell you what youre dealing with He or she also will either provide appropriate treatment or refer you for medical treatment I wish I could offer you something more specific but unfortunately its not possible to diagnose your problem without a physical exam I wish you the best of luck Im sorry youre experiencing this It sounds very unpleasant Id suggest you get checked out by a health care provider as soon as you can The symptoms you describe can be caused by a variety of conditions some of them more serious than others Im not suggesting youre experiencing an emergency but Id recommend you get this checked out sooner rather than later If your calf or thigh hurts to touch and is hot red or swollen this could be the sign of a  and you should seek immediate medical attention Feel better If youre concerned about having surgery why not get a second opinion Doctors dont take it personally when patients do that And it might give you peace of mind to hear another doctors take on your situation Your doctor can explain better than anyone what it means that your spleen is swollen inflamed and has nodules on it because he or she has seen the films such as the results of an ultrasound exam CT scan or MRI and lab results Id suggest you schedule another appointment and take a written list of questions Your doctor will be happy to explain exactly whats going on and why he or she wants to remove your spleen an operation that is called   People can live normal lives without a spleen Ask you doctor about possible complications from the surgery It should not slow you down though its true people without a spleen are somewhat more susceptible to develop infections like the flu Your doctor can explain what it will be like to live without a spleen Best of luck to you Its always worrisome when a loved one is experiencing painful scary symptoms like your husbands In fact I always think its harder to cope with these things when its happening to my husband instead of me dont you So many conditions could cause the symptoms youre describing Thats why your husbands physician is having him undergo an  This test will help figure out whats going on so that you your husband and your physician can work together to put together a treatment plan Its also possible the endoscopy is just one of several tests your husbands health care provider will run before making a diagnosis It can be very hard to wait through all of this testing but hang in there Meanwhile remember to take care of your own health needs too As the caregiver youre under a tremendous amount of stress and you dont want to get sick Be sure to eat right drink plenty of fluids and maybe go for a walk when you can Try to get plenty of sleep Youll feel better and youll be in a strong position to see your husband through this health crisis Best wishes to you I suggest you get this checked out by a medical professional Many conditions can cause the symptoms you describe but one that comes to mind is a  Obviously if thats the case you want to get treatment as soon as possible Itching is not normally a sign of Staph infection but it still would be good to rule this out At any rate youre having abnormal symptoms that are worth getting checked Meanwhile be sure to wash your hands thoroughly and often In the event you have some sort of communicable infection you want to take every precaution not to transmit it to someone else I wish you all the best Your girlfriend should see a health care professional about this Its not the kind of thing you should try lancing yourself as that can introduce infection into the wound and cause more problems Your description of the lesion makes it difficult to tell if it is a  though it doesnt sound like it These types of cysts occur very close to the vaginal opening Like I say your girlfriend needs to see a medical professional about this Wishing you well Just an update I went to the doctor and it was something called Hidradenitis suppurativa Use cold spirituous pledgets on swelling skin tissues But keep wound sterile bandaged Sounds like it may be Neuropathy At first you may notice numbness tingling abnormal sensations or pain in your feet Some people feel like they have socks on even though they are barefoot Over time this feeling spreads to your legs and hands Not sure is a friend it could be your thyroid I would go to a walkin clinic to get it checked out I would say you need to The faster the better I have the same thing and I know I dont feel good at all You may have strained a tendon or ligament I would go to your primary care provider and have it checked out Yes it is part of the inflammation process You may want to try ice compresses for 20 min on then 20 min off and rest You should definitely go to the Dr It could be an allergic reaction or something totally unrelated that also needs attention It is extremely unlikely to contract HIV by kissing HIV is passed through blood not saliva so both of you would have to have open wounds on your mounts to be able to pass it It sounds like you just had the flu you will be just fine  I havent fallen and hurt my legs at time in the last few months no gout gout Allergies and sinusitis can sometimes cause swollen lymph nodes in the neck but these usually go away fairly quickly If you have noticed persistent swollen lymph nodes under the arm it would be best to have them examined by your doctor Keep your throat moist and drink plenty of fluids specifically those that will not dehydrate you less or no caffeine If you have regular issues with allergies partner with your pharmacist and physician to make sure it is right for you concerning the timing or current trimester of your pregnancy Cant be positive but it could be genital herpesor it could just be a contact dermatitis allergic or sensitive reaction to clothing soap menstrual pads While genital warts are often said to be painless sometimes the tissue around them can become inflamed or infected by fungus or bacteria Either waygo see your doctor If they are genital herpes the antiviral treatments now available make them very treatable and their recurrence very less likely than they were even a decade ago Warts are nowadays easily and painlessly treated with laser so if that is what you have please ask for that the older methodliquid nitrogen is not that bad but often requires a few treatments And with warts you will have to have follow up paps more often for a few years as they have been associated with a higher incidence of cervical cancers Hey this happened to me before I seen a doctor and he said its from 3 things 1 not showing enough 2 sweating 3 its kinda weird when he told me but he says its also from Jerking offto much  you probably support most of your weight on the foot Its probably just stress on the bones and joints I have problems with my right ankle when i stand on it for to long and im flat footed as well I would suggest getting an ace bandage the brown stretchy ones and wrapping your ankles before going to work It will give you more support dont wrap them to tight or youll cut off circulation but do it comfortably tight If that doesnt help then try jell insoles I hope this helps You really shouldnt try to walk too much if it hurts And you should elevate it and alternate ice and heat at this point Take some antiinflammatory pills and rest it I have had swollen lymph nodes in my neck for year and I was told its from smoking is this something I should look into further id advice to seek medical attention right away Start taking low dose asprin daily If you know you already have them you may want to take 2 If the clots go to ur heart or brain without breaking down it can be fatal I would It may just be a bruise but you could have chipped or cracked a bone This can sometimes happen once you start doing personal grooming in that area Sometimes it can happen if there is a lot of friction as well It is most likely an ingrown hair What happens is that a hair follicle gets infected from not growing properly and a pimplelike pustule forms It can be red or purple in color and can be very irritating and painful Solution It needs to be lanced or popped Its going to hurt when you do it but once its done the pain will go away Be sure to get a qtip with rubbing alcohol or hydrogen peroxide on it and apply it the area But JUST to that area It might bleed for a little bit too Just apply a little pressure on it for a few minutes and it will stop bleeding Bathe or shower as normal Just be sure to keep an eye on it Hi there Happy to help First you should know what is one of the causes of liver cancer and that would be tobacco smoking andor genetic mutations from your DNA That means your DNA gets damaged and your body cant fix it But to get the professional help that you need its a good idea to check in with a doctor and tell himher your symptoms of liver cancer and the other symptoms that i am looking at for this question But if you are 78 years old then chances are that muscle mass will drop That is what happens when you hit the late ages If you have right side pain most likely you might have appendicitis So you must go to a hospital so they can remove that infected appendix Nausea is caused by appendicitis And feet swelling is mostly caused by late age so dont always panic if you get pain It depends on the condition of the bruise Usually It takes about 2 weeks for a bruise to heel A bruise means broken blood vessels inside your skin The color comes from red blood cells leaking out of the broken blood vessels Bruises are caused by deep pressure like an object hitting the skin with a certain amount of pressure The bluish color comes from the skin metabolizing meaning breaking down the blood cells that leaked out of the broken blood vessels It shows that your body is healing itself After about 5 days the bruise becomes a yellowish green and after 1014 days the bruise fades out Hi First you should know what causes cancer One of the major things is tobacco smoking or genetic mutation from your DNA Perhaps you need to use a waterbased lubricant as well The best I way I have found is to use refreezable cold packs but nothing is 100 When using the cold packs I use an ace bandage between the skin and the pack and then over the packs to give compression to the cold pack This is the most helpful way for me I am also very active and using the ace bandages allows me to get up an walk around with them on if I need or want to After the cold packs I sometimes will use a hot bath or heating pad for a short time and then stretch and flex the knee to protect range of motion it could be the left tonsilLook at it with a flashlight by looking at the throat If you see anything white white dots they need to see a doctor That is usually a sign of Strep Throat which can be extremely dangerous if not treated right away with antibiotics If the tonsil looks healthy then it could also be a lymph node Any bug bite has the risk of becoming infected Due to your symptoms I recommend that you see your doctor It may not have been a roach that bit you People can also be allergic to roaches believe it or not I dont know the answer but I can tell you that my friend keeps her feet in ice while she gets chemo so that she doesnt get problems with her feet I suggest asking about it at your next treatment As long as the chemo doesnt need to get to your feet you should be able to do that It restricts blood flow to the feet and blood flowchemo flow She also did the same with her hands Hope this helps Best of luck and keep fighting Sometimes rapid strep tests are not 100 accurate however Ive never heard of a false positive on them just false negatives The only other way to confirm the results of a rapid test is to have a throat culture sent to a lab and tested The results from that usually take 3 days How long have you been on the antibiotics for If you have finished them you should go back to the doctor since they didnt help  The pain in your armpit and chest area sounds like Mono I know because I had it summer 2012 and i am getting it again or lymphoma Sounds like you got the Epstein Bar Virus or Mono I have had both and am getting it again well rather that or Lymphoma but as for the bite might not have anything to do with it but you might want to set it checked out along with a Mononucleosis test or Epstein Bar Virus test just to make sure and they can take up to a week for the results and Mono does not have a cure or treatment you have to get lots of rest and get some over the counter pain pills the reason I know is because I have had Mono Summer 2012 and I am getting it again well rather that or Lymphoma It sounds like Mono or Epstien Bar Virus They can cause each other thogh because I had both in Summer 2012 and I still got the swollen lympnodes If you get these from Mono they can last up to a yearnot suppose to but I do and to tell you the truth I think I am getting it again but a whole lot worse Mono can lead to Lymphoma same symptoms as Mono and I know that because my ex did and well I know I got Lymphoma or Mono again but anyways if you got Mono there is no treatment for it the only thing you can do is get a lot of rest and take some over the counter pain pills and you cannot do hardly any physical activity because when you have Mono your spleen gets swollen and if you fall you could rupture your spleen and the result for that is Hospital for a while Checked ones is what I got Mononucleosis Symptoms Pain or discomfort Enlarged or swollen glands Fever Excessive sweating Night sweats Skin rash Sore throat Yellow skin Yellow eyes Decreased appetite Fatigue Headache Tenderness to touch Weakness generalized Swollen tonsils Tender glands Unable to blink or close eyelid Yes it was discovered I was allergic to Sulpha which is a main ingredient in Bactrim I did a little research for you my friend and it seems to be several things The one that might be above all is you might have a slipped disc in your Spine If it sometimes seems to radiate through your spine to one of your legs this could be an indication as well Try some yoga stretching and try to keep your spine in proper posture when this pain happens and see if it helps OR It could be gall stones which can cause the same type of pain However None of this will be as good as a physicians Xray of your back If you can afford to get it checked out  Its very possible it is gas Gas can get anywhere in your body and make you feel like youre about to die Have you tried eye drops or putting a cool rag on your eyes for a few minutes you should try this this is just a suggestion though Unfortunately spider bites have a tendency to cause infection and I believe we may be at this point in this situation This could be the start of cellulitis which is a bad skin infection I would advise seeing a health care provider as soon as possible An antihistamine like Benadryl will not help One of the questions I need to ask this parent is if they used an antihistamine like Benadryl orally or just topically and does the pediatrician know about this condition I also advise parents to use topical hydrocortisone and antihistamine products sparingly since it can be absorbed through the skin What you really want to watch out for is if your child is having problems breathing or seems really tired or nonresponsive In that case they need to go to the emergency room immediately If these symptoms are not present I would schedule an appointment with the pediatrician for further evaluation If you have any questions about proper medications to use in children ask your pharmacist Thanks for submitting a great question When I hear that eyes are red swollen and have pus my recommendation is to see a doctor or health care provider as soon as possible These are signs of an infection and you want to take this seriously because if not treated it can lead to vision loss It may be due to TMJ I had a swollen lymph node in my neck left side for months and then it disappeared The diagnosis was TMJ Overthecounter lip plumpers use ingredients that increase blood flow to the lips like cinnamon and wintergreen When blood flow is enhanced the lips tend to get mild swelling and increase in redness Sometimes these lip plumping ingredients can cause a sensation of tingling Here is a link to an

kind of swelling youre describing doesnt sound typical to me at a guess Id say it may mean that you have an infection That doesnt necessary mean an STI BTW  it can be a typical gardenvariety infection But make an appointment to see a urologist so he or she can assess it live and in person and let you know how it should be treated Too many men decide to just ignore things like this because theyre embarrassed but keeping an eye on penis health is really important Guys need to check themselves out every day just to see if there are any changes that might indicate something It also can help to

and see your dentist who can examine the area and evaluate whether an intervention is needed Without examining you it would be difficult to diagnoseUlcers in the mouth could be due to various infectious and noninfectious causes Since this has been going on for over a week it would be best to checkin with your healthcare provider to take a look formulate a diagnosis and initiate treatment to relieve your discomfort It would be best to see a health care provider for an exam and possibly xray to check for dislocation or fracture Here is more info about finger dislocation httpwwwwebmdcomfitnessexercisefingerdislocation I had a total knee replacement in March of 2010 and I too had some swelling it will go away with lots of Physical therapy exercise and lots of ice Okay so I am assuming this glob is semihard almost like a stone If so you have tonsil stones What happens is when you become sick or come in contact with some bacteria it flows down the back of your throat and your tonsils act as a filter so it doesnt reach the lungs Once inside the tonsil this bacteria or foreign substance begins to reach the cells and the tonsil sends blood to that area From there the white blood cells begin to attack the substance and form a barrier around it I have some that are big as a pencil eraser Soon a cough or even a rise in blood pressure can cause the tonsil to squeeze and pop it out of place landing at the base of your tongue The trick is to expel and not swallow it but if you do there is no harm in it You can take a flashlight and look at your tonsils If you see one you can take a qtip and press next to it It might pop out I read somewhere that by doing this it actually helps promote tonsil function and blood flow Hi you should really have no swelling Take it easy and no heavy lifting for any reason Get plenty of rest and a well balanced diet If it does not seem it go down than I would go see my dr Adderall is not associated with the side effects you mentioned MS Contin may cause swelling of the hands and feet as a side effect However it is not associated with causing joint pain I suggest you talk to your healthcare professional if you are having symptoms that are bothersome There are many things that can cause swelling below the knee known as edema It is usually a result of fluid retention and can be caused by several different health conditions Cyclosporine has been associated with causing edema in less than 2 of the people that take it I suggest you contact the prescriber and notify himher of your fathers swelling They can tell you how best to handle it considering his past medical history  Swelling in the back of the neck and back in fibro especially during a flareup is usually due to painful muscle spasms and bulging Muscles that go into spasms will shorten in length meaning they become thicker or bulge up This appears as a swollen area to observe and one can feel the lump or muscle swelling as well Its not a true edema or fluidtype swelling Heat or ice can help painful swellingknotsnodulesspasms in the muscles I prefer heat but some like cold better Massage stretching and rubbing in a muscle cream are other types of selfdirected treatments that may help and can be done by anyone anywhere A doctor may consider prescribed treatments if the selfprogram does not settle down the pain  Swelling can be associated with FM Swelling is also seen in many other conditions including thyroid disorders vascular problems venous insufficiency lymphedema heartliverrenal disease and medicine side effects Swelling should always be evaluated by your doctor to determine its cause In FM its those darn dysfunctional sensory and autonomic nerves again that create the FMrelated swelling problem One of the many sensations the sensory nerves are capable of signaling is the sensation of swelling We with FM often complain of feeling swollen even if there is no clinical evidence of swelling due to a dysfunctional misfiring of the sensory nerves We with FM get actual swelling usually a fluctuating puffiness in the fingers and anklesfeet especially due to dysfunctional signals between the autonomic nerves and the small blood vessels causing more leakage This can cause our rings to become so tight on our fingers for example And if theres swelling theres more mechanical pressureirritation of the small sensory nerves leading to increased pain Thats why it can be quite uncomfortable Because our nerves wax and wane in their dysfunctional behavior so can our painful swelling symptoms if they are due to FM Allergies are the result of an overactive immune system In response to a substance like pollen or pet dander the bodys natural defenses become overactivated to fight the invader Inflammatory reactions to allergens commonly occur in areas including the eyes nose and throat An influx of white blood cells and local release of irritating chemicals are the bodys response during an allergic reaction Swelling in the lymph nodes in the area of the neck jaw and throat can sometimes occur However swollen lymph glands can also be caused by viral and bacterial infections and other causes Like the other symptoms of seasonal allergies swollen lymph nodes eventually go away without causing any problems If you have lymph nodes that are persistently swollen for several weeks see your doctor for further evaluation Swollen lymph nodes closer to the surface of the body are generally diagnosed by a doctors examination and feeling for areas known to have coalescence of lymph nodes for example swollen lymph nodes under the arms axillary lymph nodes swollen lymph nodes in the sides of the neck cervical lymph nodes or swollen lymph nodes in the groin inguinal lymph nodes These swollen lymph nodes can be seen and felt easily Other times deeper lymph nodes could be seen on imaging studies such as CT scan of different parts of the body Tonsils in the back of the throat are also lymph nodes and they are the most visible ones in the body Diagnosing the cause of swollen lymph nodes may be challenging at times The most important component of evaluating a swollen lymph node is a thorough medical history and a complete physical examination by a doctor The doctor may ask you about symptoms such as sore throat fever and chills fatigue weight loss as well as ask for a complete list of medications sexual activity vaccination history recent travels as well as your own and your familys previous history of cancers if any A group of lymph nodes in a particular area of the body react to disturbances in that general region If there is a specific infection in the region of the swollen lymph nodes that may be the most likely cause of swelling For instance an infection of the leg or some sexually transmitted diseases can cause swelling of the lymph nodes in the groin area Physicians usually examine the lymph nodes by feeling them and characterize them based upon what the lymph nodes feel like They could be characterized for example as Large or small Tender or nontender Fixed or mobile Hard or soft Firm or rubbery These characteristics can be useful in suggesting the cause of the lymph node swelling For example a hard nontender nonmoveable lymph node may be more characteristic of a cancer that has spread to that node On the other hand a soft tender moveable lymph node could more likely represent an infection If the enlarged lymph nodes are suspected to be related to a cancer then a biopsy of the lymph node may determine the cancer type For example a swollen lymph node around the collar bone supraclavicular lymph node may signify lung cancer in a person who may have other clinical clues suggestive of lung cancer Possibly hypothyroid Look up conditions on here and see if they relate That would be my best guess without knowing more It can make you feel really bad if left untreated i am having some chest pain as well it started with swelling about a week ago and the pain seems to be getting worse everyday my breast is burning and feels very heavy i am more tired than usual and my armpit is sore also This is very normal There are lots of nerves associated with the teeth and mouth so swelling and pain is to be expected  I dont know Hi Yes its a problem but as they say there are no problems just solutions So have you change you washing soap lately Try getting her in a sea salt bath this may help in calming it down just two handfuls of SS will do get her to do this twice a day If it will help get not to wear any knickers when shes indoors Only wear cotton knickers no trousers or tights This is a start Have a read up on this Behets syndrome its just a thought read through this link its from the Uks NHS httpwwwnhsukConditionsBehcetsdiseasePagesintroductionaspx Just copy this link into google to open and read Will keep searching Good Luck Hi Has your wife by any chance changed her washing powder brand lately you may be getting a reaction to if try buying and wearing some new briefs for a few days see if it clears up if so you know wear its coming from Good Luck Hi I think you should see a urologist to get this small problem seen to it would be the only way to go Good Luck Hi In that case I would get off to your doctor ASAP Good Luck Hi found you this nice piece of info from Dr Dhide The simple answer to that is yes many antibiotics do affect menstrual periods The mechanism of how that happens is mainly related to reducing the available estrogen hormone which can lead to a change in the cycle and make it irregular Details As you are aware in the first fourteen days of a 28 day menstrual cycle the follicle starts growing and the initial hormone production is mainly estrogen This starts making the lining of the endometrium thicker After ovulation estrogen is joined by progesterone from the corpus luteum making the endometrium denser and mature Estrogen is not only metabolized by the liver but also recirculated between the gut and the liver enterohepatic circulation Antibiotics can affect estrogen metabolism in two ways Most antibiotics are metabolized in the liver and their presence can affect the rate of metabolism of estrogen and progesterone This can change the supply of estrogen available in the blood and that can cause irregularity of the cycle Some antibiotics cause diarrhea like symptoms as they change the gut flora This causes excessive excretion of estrogen through the gut as there is less time for reabsorption of estrogen thus affecting the enterohepatic circulation This too reduces levels of estrogen in the blood Thus by changing the levels of estrogen in the blood the cycle will get disturbed because the pituitary gland secretes its hormones depending on the level of estrogen in the blood It is now getting the wrong information and wont act as expected Ovulation is dependent on the pituitary gland identifying that there is enough estrogen in the blood and all these delicate balances are scuppered on antibiotic treatment This way many antibiotics can cause irregular menstrual cycle The other point to note is you take

lung cancer and heart disease Now its time to read about what smoking does to your feet Sometimes a doctor can tell just by looking at patients feet whether they smoke says James Mahoney DPM an associate professor of podiatric surgery at Des Moines University in Iowa The skin on their feet is often thinner shinier and reddish in colour he says Your feet are located a long way from your heart which means that even under the best of circumstances they dont receive as much blood circulation as other parts of your body And if you smoke your body is definitely not working under peak conditions A condition called peripheral arterial disease  which affects about 8 million Americans  is one way that smoking can seriously harm your feet Did say tells it like it is Good Luck It could be a number of things but it sounds most like it might be a bulging disc I would start by going to you doctor or to a physical therapist In some cases you can get steriod shots to relieve the pain but thats dangerous because you could risk further damage too I would check with your doctor before doing any other kind of strenuous labor like moving heavy items lifting furniture carrying heavy packages etc It is probably not gout if it were gout it would be swelling in one particular area like the base of the big toe It could possibly be athletes foot but I would try to see a podiatrist or even possibly a dermatologist I wouldnt try any more home remedies that might be increasing the irritation Hiatal Hernia can make you feel like you have swallowed something the wrong way or make you get choked or a blockage while eating It can cause pain in your chest similar to heart attack  Usely goes away in a few minutes unless you get a blockage Then you cant swallow any thing No it is by prescription only go see a doctor NO WAY It is not worth the risk of giving yourself a bigger pain with that ankle What I now know is that when an ankle bruised All those muscles that were able to help you not get hurt before are strained and stretched and if it heals proberly then you might be able to continue same lifestyle AFTER it has mended If you make one simple bad move that might not seem difficult It could That is when you potentially always have a bad ankle Really just sit this one out those are typical allergic reaction especially she has identified those that triggers it those laboratory findings got

it could have something to do with a nerve See a rheumatologist for an arthritis evaluation could be bad circulationgo see your family doc I have gotten thrush from taking antibiotics Mouth and throat got so tender I couldnt eat My MD prescribed a syrup that cleared it right up 4 at the pharmacy He called it in Thrush will give you a white cotton mouth Also either Crest or Colgate makes a probotic mouthwah that will help But it burns when you first start using it It could be due to less circulation of blood and lack of enough oxygen Wearing stockings would improve the blood flow When does a doctor decide to remove a swollen non cancerous lypmph node HI I am eight weeks postop and still have pain and swelling albeit much less then it was a couple of weeks ago I do exercises every day I also use the Flexinator machine three times daily for flexion helps relieve pain providing u can get thru the pain of using itits TOTURE LOL Use your pain pills do your physio work thru the pain and dont give up Yes I think that pain eight weeks following surgery is normal but you should also have shown vast improvement from two weeks postop FEEL BETTER and do your physio I also wanted to mention there is almost no bruising just some VERY SLIGHT discoloration All of us are anxious to see results Whether it is cosmetic surgery or building a home we like to see the work done and sometimes become inappropriately impatient I often have to remind patients that with any operation it takes nature 100 days to do the basic repair work and absorb most of the swelling Whether that is an artificial hip replacement a hernia repair a breast reduction or rhinoplasty or septoplasty rhinoplasty with turbinate resection which not only improves appearance but also improves the airway and prevents sinus problems  it takes time for ole Mother Nature to do its job We cant rush nature we cant push the clock We have to understand that this is what it takes to finish the job You know the old saying Rome wasnt built in a day Great noses are built in day But it takes weeks or months for all the swelling to go down Now this does not mean that the nose looks hideous or is unattractive Typically within seven to 10 days the nose looks very good But it continues to get better It ripens like wine Swelling goes down Refinement sets in The nose becomes thinner and more delicate less bulbous But all this takes place a tiny bit each day Patients while told ahead of time that it takes weeks and up to a couple months for the appearance to optimize often become impatient and ask Whats wrong Why is my nose still swollen or What can be done to make the swelling go away We have to be frank and say to them that we cannot push nature beyond its speed any more than human beings can run faster than the fastest runner can run or make corn grow six feet in one week There are certain limitations that nature imposes on all things human However if the cosmetic plastic surgeon reminds the patient that the outcome will be better than it appears at a week or a month or two months or three months then hopefully the patient  and family  will accept that Just this week one of our cosmetic nasal plastic surgery rhinoplasty patients came in Prior to surgery she was an otherwise attractive young lady but had a crooked nose that was bulbous had a bump Too big for her delicate face Further it was turned down such that every time she smiled her nose almost hit her lip The crookedness implied internal blockage and indeed she had trouble breathing because of a deviated septum and enlarged turbinates To make matters generally worse she had some facial asymmetries which were also mirrored in the nose That was another reason why it looked crooked Not the simplest of cases right Nonetheless the prospects for success were very good when we took on the case in June of 2009 The case went very well Mission accomplished We straightened the nose corrected the asymmetry took off the bump narrowed the tip We raised the tip from the lip and prevented the nose from plunging with every smile But the nose was swollen in the first week or two  perhaps a bit more than the average  but that reflected how much work was done But after the second week things got better and three weeks later she was looking quite decent and could now appreciate the improvement Unfortunately the patient and her parents were a bit anxious and somewhat unrealistic about what it would take nature to deliver the final result I kept assuring them that everything was on course that things were getting better and not worse and that nature would finish the job by adding additional refinements as the swelling was reduced At six months the nose looked terrific but I knew it would look better even after a longer period of time Now in this case understand that because the patient has thick skin and such extensive surgery the complete healing period was somewhat prolonged When she came in this week it was 13 months after the surgery She looked fantastic Extremely happy Now a beautiful woman Since the last visit the nose had improved significantly over a period of months as predicted Yes it took nearly a year which is not typical usually it is three to six months for optimization but thats what it took for this particular young ladys nose We had no control over nature But we had trust The important thing is to remember that once the result was in this teenager has it for the rest of her life Yes it takes some patience and fortitude to ride out the reduction of swelling and the further improvement But when you think while it took longer than usual one year compare that to the lifetime of pleasure that now follows Maybe that wait wasnt quite so long Who are you dating Hannibal Lector Yes a bit can cause a deep bruise called a hematoma and this can form a lump for a while It should eventually go away as you body reabsorbs the blood in this tissueand if your boyfriend bites you again HE should go away Sounds like it is time for you to see your medical provider so that you can have your throat and ears properly examined If you have an infection that is causing the pain your medical provider can help If your son is urinating okay the bruised penis should heal without an lifelong problems If he is having any pain or restriction in his ability to urinate it would be good to have his medical provider examine him In the meantime cool compresses may help Every time I see a girls bike without those crossbars I often wonder why only girls especially girls who no longer where long dresses or skirts use them They are much more appropriate for boysfor this very reason As you know I have no way of seeing your boyfriends tailbone area but based on your description he may have a PILONIDAL SINUS TRACT You can do some personal research on this relativelycommon condition on the Internet by putting those words in your search engine The only cure of pilonidal sinus tracts especially ones that occasionally or frequently become infected is their surgical removal It is important that this area remain very clean and if possible hairfree Hairs can occasionally grow into these open areas and some have hair follicles within them When this happens there is a greater chance of a secondary infection That would be highly unlikely unless the swollen prostate completely blocked the urine flow and no one did anything about it and the person went into kidney failure No Ibuprofen 800mg is the maximum single dosenever take TWO Yes your finger could be broken IF the xrays did not clearly show your finger The palm of your hand is a different area called the metacarpals so make sure the xray viewed this area as well or you may need another film Sprains do not show up on xraysjust bones Since I cant examine you you may need to see a medical provider again if the treatment is not helping The cause would depend on whether you were a male or female but basically the urethra is subject to inflammation associated with sexual activity andor infection urethritis You may want to repost your question with a bit more details than just a few words Finding the cause or causes of hives is VERY clinically difficult There are no tests that would conclusively determine the specific cause You can due hundreds of tests and perhaps get a few things that show up positive but that does not prove this is the specific cause There are no tests for rare causes unfortunately Of course you and her mother are frustated Who wouldnt be Frustration does not make it any easier in finding a cause so the next best thing to do is just treat her for hives with something that worksand something that she can take every day No this is not a sign of bruising but it may be a sign of contact reaction Since the redness and swelling has occurred in both hands at the same time there is a possibility that he picked up more than just a sand bag If he picked up or handled cement this is an entirely different problem Cement does cause the hands to become red and irritated Did he put his handprint into some fresh cement I think you need to do a little more investigation of a nineyear old boys day The medical provider is quite skilled at smelling tobacco on your breath but there will not likely be any telltale signs of your smoking from just looking at your tonsils You are more prone to tonsillitis and other upper respiratory infections BECAUSE you are a smoker Dont be a fool my young friend When you start smoking young you are more likely to start having serious consequences at a younger age so dont be surprised in the future when a doctor tells you that you have cancer or some type of other serious cigaretterelated illness STOP NOWnot because it is illegal but because only stupid people and people who do not plan on living a long and healthy life smoke If you are not improving in a day or so you may need to see a medical provider for an examination Medical providers are bound by confidentiality so please dont worry that your secret will be revealed to a parent Just insist on being in the exam room alone and then disclose how this happened What you tell a parent is really up to you In the meantime spend some time sitting in a hot bathtuband keep fingers and other objects out of your vagina until you have healed You will need to see your medical provider right away This is not something you can accurately diagnose or effectively treat at home A pimple may have caused a deeper skin infection in the skin lining of the ear canal called cellulitis This requires prompt treatment usually with an oral antibiotic andor an antibiotic ear drop A pimple will not cause a middle ear infection but it can certainly cause in external ear infection otitis externa AhhhSandbox Eyes I see this quite often The next step assuming he is still crying rubbing his eyes and complaining is to see a medical provider to see if he has a CORNEAL ABRASION  a painful scratch on the cornea You will need to take him to an Urgent Care facility The medical provider will put a drop or two of an anesthetic solution to numb the eye instant relief A tiny amount of brightyellow fluorecein dye will be put in the eye to reveal any scratch It can be seen using a black light in a darkened examination room If he does have a tiny scratch he will need some antibiotic drops or ointment for a few days while it heals These things are painful but fortunately they heal very fast Lymph nodes perhaps but never a ganglion nerve cyst Her prognosis would be unclear at this time Not knowing the details and findings of her scans CT MRI etc and her neurosurgeons assessments there is really no way to guess at an outcome The fact that she survived to go this far is really a miracle so since this is a season of miracles you can sincerely wish for a complete recovery in time How long That also could not be determined The brain has a remarkable way of healing itself if the damage is not extensive I am sure that the family has been wellinformed so you may want to talk with a family member for more details Go visit her if you can Sometimes the voice of a dear friend can be excellent medicine too What KIND of medication You may have a common case of balanitis due to yeast or even a bacterial infection but unfortunately this would take an examination to definitively determine  not something that can be accomplished over the Internet See your medical provider so you can be properly diagnosed and treated Not likely A toe injury should not cause the systemic symptoms like you are describing You most likely have something else going on perhaps a viral infection in addition to your injured toe There are no rules in medicine that states that a person can only have one issue at a time or that all symptoms must somehow be connected Your toe needs medicallyevaluated but it is not really considered an emergency If you have the option seeing your regular medical provider or an urgent care facility may be more appropriate and less expensive The blood under the nail may need evacuated and the toe may need to be xrayed There can be many reasons but it would not be possible for me or any medical provider to be able to specifically determine that cause you YOUR testicle pain blindly over the Internet You will need to see your primary care medical provider or a urologist Not knowing the type of spider venomous or not or the agewieght of your son I would advise you to seek medical care An area of swelling the size of an orange is very concerning The condom can cause an irritation but so can the act of vaginal sexespecially for the first timeThe redness or swollen area at the entrance to your vagina could be from some tiny tears along your hymen assuming you still had one at the time you had sex for the first time Burning on urination could be cystitis irritation and inflammation at the opening where you pee used to be called honeymoon cystitis back in the days when the honeymoon was the first time a woman had sex or even a urinary tract infection Sexual activity can stir up a lot of germs in this area  and germs can lead to a urinary or bladder infection Germs can come from fingers mouths oral sex as well as a penis Now that you have chosen to be sexually involved you have a responsibility to make adultlike decisions when it comes to your medical care If you do have a urinary tract infection burning on urination frequency urgency or even blood when you wipe this needs to be medically evaluated A urine test will not reveal your recent sexual debut so it is really up to you whether to disclose this information A pelvic examination is not usually needed to make this diagnosisonly a simple urine test My suggestion would be for you to get checkedjust in case Women and girls of all ages can get urinary infections whether they are having sex or not Obviously infections are more common if you do have sex I am pleased that you and your partner used a condom Make sure you use them 100 of the time or urinary burning will be the least of your problems I dont knowyou didnt post the LOCATION of this gland or lymph node For genital herpes this is usually in the groin area Nothe arm may or may not be swollen and the child could still have a fracture or dislocation All the doctor needs to do is just look in your mouththe tonsils are easily visible A decision to do a throat swab is really based on your medical history an the appearance of your throattonsils He can start with his primary care medical provider While an orthopedist or rheumatologist could be needed the primary care provider would be able to determine which one would be appropriate based on his or her examination and diagnostic blood tests I have no way of assessing the severity of your injury over the Internet nor predict if you will get a subsequent injury In order to get those answers you would need to be examined firsthand no pun intended by a medical professional and perhaps have an xray of your hand to rule out a subtle fracture Only if the shingles are on your face Shingles follows a specific nerve pathway I really cant address your question since I do not know anything about you your medical history or if it is indeed your ovaries that are causing your symptoms Women can have ovulatory pain but without knowing your cycle I cant really make that blind assumption I would suggest that you call your medical provider  someone who does know your history and someone who has the capabilities of examining you firsthand A hemorrhoid is really a varicose vein in the circle of veins around your anal ring They can be inside the anus internal or outside external but not an inch away Your mass is something else but it would not be prudent to blindly guess You will need to be examined It could be cyst or even an abscess if it is tender but there are other possibilities Get it checked out Zithromax will have no effect on influenza It is an antibiotic and this would only work for a BACTERIAL infection influenza is a virus The prednisone may have been for wheezing  Neither medication will cause swollen lymph nodes but your underlying medical issues whether it was influenza or not certainly can You would need to see your medical provider again to properly evaluate the significance of those nodes Not necessarily We often wait a week or so before casting If you put a snug cast on a freshlyinjured area the cast will not fit properly when the swelling goes down and even worseif the area started to swell more this could compromise the blood flow to the feettoes Many will put the person in a special boot instead of a cast but that depends on the fracture There are many types of ankle fracture some are more stable than others If your doctor feels that a plate is needed this may be because this fracture is unstable Because the ankle is a weightbearing joint there are many considerations when it comes to managing these fractures Your son should be totally on crutches with no weightbearing and hopefully he has not had subsequent injury in the last week since the original fracture was diagnosed this can happen A comparison xray may be required An enlarged liver or spleen in someone with mononucleosis would prohibit them from playing contact or collisiontype sports Everyones recovery from mono is different so there are really no set rules for when to return to sports She would need to be  who would certify that a her liver enzymes have returned to normal b her liver and spleen are no longer enlarged and subject to injury and c she has recovered to the point of being able to handle the rigors of practice and games again This could be a peritonsillar abscess onesided severe tonsillar swelling is the primary sign of this potentiallyserious problem Since I cant see it my advice would be to seek medical care as soon as you can You need to be reexamined Unless your doctor specifically tested you for Strep before prescribing the Keflexfailure to respond or even worse on antibiotics could indicate that you have mononucleosis mono so this should be considered when you are seen today I cannot specifically advise you since I do not have the ability to SEE or EXAMINE your injuries so seeing a medical provider would be prudent  a vague description is not sufficient information to determine the significance of your injuries Call the orthopedistthe one that performed the surgery You are going to need to be reexamined today in most cases It is very difficult for me to comment on your case since I do not know any of the details including the reason for the antibitoics in the first place Not all swollen glands are bacterial so if you a a viral infection they would not help no matter what antibiotic you chose If you are getting worse it is up to your doctor to run some additional diagnostic test I think this would be better than just throwing another a 4th antibiotic at it without really knowing if the underlying reason justifies it There is always a possibility of a fracture when you have a crush injury The only way you will be sure is to have it xrayed If you dont have any fracturesgreat but if you do it is going to require a different treatment plan The sooner you know FOR SURE the better You will need to see your medical provider so you can have your handfingers properly examined It would not be possible to determine the reasons for your swelling over the Internet since the exact details of your fractures is not known It is not really the swollen node that is the issue but rather the underlying CAUSE of the node reaction The groin lymph nodes drain a huge area of the body  from your toes to your groin People are often surprised when the culprit is an infected toe or irritated scratch on the leg Inflammation in the groin itself like infections I dont know if you are male or femaledifferent parts ingrown or hair follicle infections shaving etc all can cause groin reaction Having a careful exam  looking for possible sources of this node reaction  is important but this is not likely to be a rush to the doctor right away type of urgency It should be checked however It is not possible to make a blind diagnosis over the Internet In other words if I cant see it firsthand during and exam and actually feel it it would not be possible for me or any medical provider to offer you a definitive answer You will need to see a medical professional or dermatologist Sorry Rocephin is very appropriate for cellulitis but may need more than just one injection We often give one injection a day for three days depending on the severity of the cellulitis and response and yesit is very important to remain on oral antibiotics for a period of time until the cellulitis has resolved Penicillin is only one of the many choices that can be used It is not your inner ear This is any entirely different part of your ear near your brain If the pencil went that far you would have other issues for sure Assuming that you are the one who put the pencil in your own ear my advice would be for you to just leave the ear alone now A bit of dried blood is not going to hurt anything but any attempts to remove it could cause more problems You may have even punctured your own eardrum Without an examination by a medical provider there is really no way to know what is going on in your ear CANAL It could just be scratched but that is a blind guess By posting this question you are indicating concern so it would be in your best interest to see a medical provider so that you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated  not something that can be accomplished online in this forum Because you are hypersensitive even allergic to the mosquito bites It would be wise for you to use an effectie mosquito repellant when they are about and have a good cortisonebased cream to apply the bite sites An oral antihistamine may also help I am sorry but I have no way of blindly diagnosing your ear problem over the Internet let alone treating you If your current medical provider is not helping please ask for a referral to an ENT Ear Nose and Throat specialist See a dentist immediately You may need to see TWO professionals a dentist and your primary care medical provider if this ends up not being a dental problemunlikely See the dentist first Firstice compresess or soak it in a glass of ice water Second you need to make a determination based on the severity of the injury and the nature of the injury how it happened if you need to seek medical care for a possible fracture Since I dont know the details I would suggest that seeing a medical provider would be appropriate I wish that I could address your question but without the ability to see your infection firsthand I would only be making a blind guess not something that medical providers like to do My suggestion to you is to call your medical provider  someone who has seen this infection and is treating you  for patient specific advice This infection is being treated and managed appropriately so I cannot imagine that you will not get better There could be several different reasons to have a mass in your scrotum Some of the more common reasons could be an i or a  I am not sure what type of cyst that you had removed four years ago but it is time for you to see your urologist again to have this new lump properly examined diagnosed and treated I cant see it as you know nor can I take a more detailed medical history or examine you to narrow down the possibilities This can be a bite spider or you may have secondary infectionjust a blind guess Without a handson examination you cannot be properly diagnosed or treated so I suggest that you seek a medical evaluation today Unfortunately I do not have enough information to address your question Example I have no idea of the location of the previous MRSA infection the age of your child etc I can tell you that there are dozens and dozens of reasons for lymph nodes to react enlarge so it is really up to hisher pediatrician to determine the cause and significance of the nodes Most lymph nodes are innocent but I do not have sufficient medical information about your child nor the ability to examine him her to make that important call You are asking for very patientspecific advice Since I do not know the medical details of your case it would be impossible to blindly give you the okay to go swimminggo to schoolworkor even make a determination if you are contagious I dont know the location or extent of your cellulitis the type of bacteria that was cultured or even the name and dosage of your antibiotic The only person that can give you this okay would be the medical provider who is treating you I am sorry Those are signs of a continuing or recurrent yeast infection so you may need that Difucan again I am surprised that the cream was not helpful so perhaps your medical provider can suggest a different topical or vaginal medication for you to use I addressed your question on the Ear Nose and Throat Community Unfortunately I have no way to confirm if your roommate has a mole or an abscess inside her ear but a mole does not suddenly occur within hours of a scratch a skin abscess can form The fact that this skin lesion is constantly draining is the real concern It needs to be properly diagnosed and treated Since I cant examine your roommate I cannot determine the true nature of this draining lesion Sorry Her sinuses do not drain in her ears but they can drain down the back of her throat There is an opening of the Eustachian tubes in her throat but this fluid will not drain UP into the ear The ear has the potential of creating its own fluid that can become stagnant Prednisone has plenty of sideeffects but it can be very beneficial when properly used It does not cause fibromyalgia however As a matter of fact no one really knows what causes fibromyalgia His pediatrician or pediatric urologist will need to examine him It is not possible to offer you a definitive answer based solely on your description Yes it could be an inguinal hernia or a hydrocele A torsion twisting is also possible but these are very painful and quite seriousI suspect he would be in obvious pain if this is happening but torsions can occur and quickly detorse in some children Either way an examine will be required to make that important determination If he is in pain due to this swelling or if the swelling is becoming larger an emergency room visit is warranted and an scrotal ultrasound is usually ordered to help make the diagnosis No obvious drainage The amount of fluid in a Bartholin cyst varies and a small leak may not have been obvious A burst cyst would have been Sometimes the cystic fluid is simply reabsorbed by the body so there is no drainage If you are having reoccurring Bartholin gland cysts perhaps it is time to have a more definitive surgery to prevent this from happening There is no cure for severe sunburn Severe sunburn is caused by people who do not use an effective sunscreen expose themselves to the bright son and stay out too long This is really all your fault you know Cold compresses Ibuprofen And a bit of selfreflection to realize that this could have been prevented I cannot answer your question without a direct handson examination  obviously not possible over the Internet I strongly suggest two things See your medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated and two You are at risk for CAUSING an infection by doing this You are correct Bactrim DS is an antibiotic that will not be helpful in the management of gout Unless the medical provider felt that there was a possibility of an underlying infection Bactrim is often used for Staph infections there would be no use if just treating gout You cant diagnose an illness based on vague symptoms alone but your symptoms are troubling Brownish or yellow eyes could mean jaundice hepatitis or other liver problems Throwing up blood can be a very serious sign It would be in your best interest to see a medical provider as soon as possible Then get an opinion from a MEDICAL DOCTOR such as an orthopedist All you have now is your chiropractors opinion  someone who is getting some financial benefits from keeping you under care for a long period of time If you have osteoarthritis chiropractic is NOT going to cure you So see an orthopedist Have an MRI of your neck There are four step required for your answer 1 You must first have a medical history I do not know anything about you or even the reason you were hospitalized 2 You must have a medical examination of your swollen feet  there can be many different causes 3 You need a diagnosis and a treatment plan 4 Finally if all of these steps are done you may get that cure you are seeking Unfortunately you are asking for something that cannot be provided over the Internet so you will need to consult your medical provider Plantar means bottom of the foot warts may require more than on treatment using liquid nitrogen but this method can still fail There are other prescription chemical treatments that your doctor may suggest if your wart has not resolved but there is nothing other than salicylic acid that is effective overthecounter Any medical provider should be able to help You most likely have an infection but a concern would be a retained foreign body a tiny wood sliver so make sure the health care professional considers this possibility Whooping cough pertussis can be laboratory proven by an lab testand so can Strep It is possible to develop both since they are two different organisms I trust that you are under the care of a good medical provider who has properly tested you examined you and have you under appropriate treatment These are not things you should selfdiagnose or treat at home Only if your TMJ and knee pain is BOTH caused by a type of arthritis otherwise most clinicians would consider them to be separate problems Yes You may have a corneal abrasion If your brother was specifically prescribed a diuretic by one of his physicians who are treating his lung cancer then yeshe should take it Each person on chemotherapy is uniqueoften taking different types and dosages of chemotherapeutic agents and not every person would need a diuretic Your brother appears that he does I wish your brother and family the very best on his treatment Oops I missed the lid part If the dog did not actually scratch your eyeball then a corneal abrasion is less likely If the dog only scratched your skin clean it very throughly and apply a topical antibiotic ointment or cream If it appears to be getting infected in spite of these home treatment efforts then you can see your medical provider It may not have ever been a spider biteOne consideration would be a herpetic whitlow  a fever blistercold sore of sorts that occur on the finger It will come back over and over itch at first and will definitely get red or even have a tiny blister Like most herpetic infections the body keeps it suppressed most of the time unless of course you are going through an illness or stress Look this up on the Internet and see if it fits As you may know I cannot make a blind diagnosis over the Internet but your story seems to point in this direction There is no direct connection between a fractured clavicle collar bone and swollen feet assuming you did not sustain an injury to your ankles or feet at the same time as the clavicle incident It would be best to consult your medical provider  someone who knows you and your medical history  and someone who has the ability to examine you to address our swollen feet See an ophthalmologist eye physician for a second opinion A droopy eyelid may be ptosis a problem with the nerve leading to this eye lid There can be other reason I dont know the whole story here but mono mononucleosis is a viral infection so yes you could have mono or another viral infection I dont know what tests have been run on you but an EBV panel is consider the most sensitive test for mono Yes these little are normal and they can even leak a drop of breast milk You and your child shared a blood supply and your blood had high levels of a hormone that prepared you for breastfeeding Those same hormones are in your daughters blood supply right now but it will soon dissipate Then you will not see those breasts again until she make her own hormones A bulging eardrum can cause vertigo due to the pressure This usually means a middle ear infection but cephalexin would not be my drug of choice to treat this in an adult although I dont know your dosage or medication history The medicine probably is not your culprit but rather your ear disorder Vertigo is also common in INNER EAR infections and these are often viral Viral infections do not respond to any antibiotic therapy Since I have no way of knowing your diagnosis or severity of symptoms you will need to consult your medical provider if you are not getting better Unless a dentist removed your wisdom teeth you can still have them but there can be other reasons to account for your symptomssuch as an abscess or infection or a reactive lymph node Please see your medical provider or dentist so that you can be properly examined and diagnosed Nogive them your right arm to take the blood pressure reading Ice compresses and ibuprofen assuming you can medically use this type of medication Wear opentoed shoes for a while Elevate your legfoot You may want to consider buddy taping your injured toe to an adjacent uninjured toe to give it more support Persistent knee pain lasting over a month from a jogging injury where there was a loud pop could be many things but a full or partial tear of one of the ligaments tendons or menesci would be high on the list as well as cartilege tears It would be in your fiances best interest to see a good orthopedist he should have done this weeks ago He may need some imaging studies like an MRI of that painful knee Scarlet fever is caused by Strep It would not be likely that this person would still be contagious months later unless of course they are a Strep carrier People can get exposed to Strep quite easily by other people or from objects that area contaminated by Strep The only way you will know for sure if you have Strep is to be tested Yes its safe to soak your feet in Epsom salts but I am not sure this will really help your swollen feet Please talk to your OBGYN about this issue since swollen feet during pregnancy is something that may need to be addressed medically Make sure you are elevating your feet as much as you can good excuse for taking it easy this last monthyou are going get quite busy soon and closely watch your salt intake Some special compression socks may be helpful Tonsils that have an abscess can certainly burst Severely enlarged tonsils from mono may seem deflated once they retreat back to their premono size I have no way of seeing your tonsils as you know so I cannot blindly determine if what you are seeing is normal or not You would need to see your medical provider for an examination No a pimple will not likely show up on an MRI I am sure the MRI was ordered to look for other possible causes for the swollen facenot just the pimple It is NOT normal to continue to have ear pain five months after tube grommet insertion so I would suggest that you try and get a second opinion from another ENTsince two ENT heads are better than one The area behind the ear is the mastoid sinus but postauricular lymph nodes can also be painful Obviously ruling out mastoiditis  a complication of chronic middle ear infections  would be very important The leakage otorrhea is likely the drainage of fluid through the grommets from the middle ear space The most common side effect of this treatment is what you are experiencing namely burning and irritation Assuming you have used this agent properly the cure rate is higher than some other methods The chemical podophyllotoxin causes necrosis and destruction of the condyloma and a bit of the surrounding healthy tissue This can appear burned white or even black This is expected Soon this damaged tissue will heal and you should be returning to normal but you will need to be carefully examined again since some of the smaller condyloma may have escaped destruction and will also need carefully treated Get a paper tablet and write one thousand times I will not mess with a pimple in my ear every again Then call your medical provider explain the situation You will either be prescribed an oral antibiotic over the phone for the infection you most likely caused or you will need to be examined firsthandand then prescribed an antibiotic It is not possible to make a blind diagnosis of a dermatological problem I would need to examine your son which obviously I cannot Impetigo is a Staph Strep infection MRSA is a specific type of Staph infection Both can cause those symptoms and both would require a wound culture to make the diagnostic distinction If he is worried about MRSA the culture is essential Bactrim and Bactroban would treat Staph infection but Strep one cause of impetigo would not be improved by Bactrim Send him to Student Health or an Urgent Care facility so he can be examined tested and treated It could be both Yeast infections in the vagina tend to itch urinary infections tend to be painful with urination only and can be accompanied by the urge to urinate even after you have urinated See your medical provider for a urinalysis to see if you do indeed have an infection needing to be treated A vaginal yeast infection can usually be treated over the counter with antiyeast vaginal medications There can be many reasons for perianal itching including a lack of personal hygienechemical irritation soaps detergents dryer sheets hemorrhoids fissures tiny cracks around the anus andpinworms Pinworms are notorious from causing itchy butts usually at night Any patientspecific treatment instructions should be done by the medical provider who is caring for you but if you do not need the pain relief from Vicodin now you can switch to ibuprofen at any time if your doctor is okay with it The Vicodin will not be bioeffective after six hours or so so anytime after that Why dont you give your swollen penis a day off Save the Viagra to use when your penis is no longer swollen Will sunburned legs hurt the baby No What can you do How about using some sunscreen next time so you will not have to deal with unnecessary pain Right now you can just use coolcold compresses The temporary pain you are experiencing is to remind you not to let this happen ever again When you have your baby you will need to carefully protect him or her from the burning rays of the sun too The big concern would be a secondary infection You can call the medical provider that surgically removed your nail or see another medical provider If the ER is your only option this would be an acceptable next step Get the finger in ice water If the accumulation of blood is under the nail subungual hematoma then it may need to be drained A hole is bored through the nail not as bad as it sounds to allow the blood to be released The pressure of the accumulated blood is painful so this procedure relieves a lot of pain If the blood accumulation is in the soft tissue of the finger it cannot be drainedit will need to be slowly reabsorbed by the body If you think the injury could of resulted in a fracture only an xray could confirm this My son is biracial and his dr said that its just his tyroid gland that its ok that they are swollenjust as long as there is no painHe said that alot of boys get it You suffered a broken toe that quite possibly did not heal as it should have or either it is not fully healed When it first happened did you see a doctor or have an xray done I broke my big toe 6 weeks ago and I still cant bend it either You have all the signs of a broken toe maybe it needs more time to heal Im not a doctor but from experiencing the same thing I think you need to have a doctor look at the toe so an xray can be done You need work if you eye get better on it own If not you need make dotor trip I strongly recommend returning to both the eye doctor and a dermatologist While it isnt common blindness can be caused if the shingles virus infects the eye If the blisters are anywhere near his eye this can be a concern It is also possible that the antiviral they have him on simply isnt effective for him I was prescribed two different antivirals to treat my shingles outbreak last fall because the first wasnt giving the results we wanted probably due to an incompatibility with my own body chemistrythats what the dermatologist told me Sounds like cellulitis See your doctor immediately Not necessarily Be calm and assess the damage first Is the nail damaged at all Is there bleeding It is doubtful the injury is severe enough to warrant an ER visit It probably hurt like the dickens and scared you to death but it would be hard to sustain a serious injury this way Elevated your foot with an ice pack and call your family doctor in the morning This would definitely be a good reason to contact your surgeons office immediately It may be a post op comlication but let your doctor decide that Please review your post op home instructions There should be a number for you to call Well I went about 6 weeks ago and he said itll go down If it aint went down yet I cant see it going down at all I tried wearing a jock strap to keep it pointed upwards that helped a little but as soon as I took it off the swelling came right back Not enough information Age might help Apparently Dr Oz just did a piece about The Triangle of Deaththat area from between your eyes to just below the corners of your mouth Most people will have their hands in and around there doing something either consciously or subconsciously at least once a day Pulling nose hair and popping zits on the nose and near the lips can easily lead to infection including infections that can spread to the brain Im not suggesting you did any of those things but swelling is a common sign of infection Unfortunately I have to agree with the other person here I dont think its acne Doesnt sound like acne It also doesnt sound like an ingrown hair either Sorry sister but I think you might have an STD Youre going to want to go get a real medical opinion on it Dont google it because the pictures will gross you out Go to your doctor Thats the best advice There are many possibilities such as an aphthous ulcer or canker sore an abscess or an erupting tooth If your child is in any pain I would recommend a trip to the pediatric dentist for an evaluation I have tried heat and medications for the fibro flare ups but I dont know Ticks can carry Lyme disease which can cause major medical problems I would take himher in for testing You should still have her seen by a doctor Especially if you do not know what type of tick it is Do you know if it left a bull eye mark They can treat with antibiotic as a preventative if caught soon enough I would call your Dr Even with out a fever you can still be sick You could have a virus that is going around But with sore throat and swollen glands could possibly be strep throat which can in some cases make you have nausea You do not always run a fever with strep throat I am not a doctor but it does not hurt to go to the DR The worst thing they can say is it is a virus and it has to take its course frequently i have an issue with feeling the sensation to pee but no urine i find that drinking lots of water usually fixes that see doctor about it being genital herpes perhaps pressure may be on her nerves I would make an appointment with your doctor you may have stepped on a tiny splinter or something small that you dont even realize it or it could mean that your shoes are too small for your feet You have Diabetes so you really need to be cautious about your feet I have seen too many amputations because diabetics just let their feet go after something simple as an irritated toe You may be experiencing a pinch nerve try to change into loose fitting clothes and take some antiinflammatories in you can and if it still is bothering you after a few days make an appointment with your doctor Depends on the grade of tear I had a grade 2 MCL tear and it took about 12 month till I could do daily things without a limp or limitations Took 67 months until it was strong enough to resume sports or work outs Now mind you I wasnt going to a doctor getting surgery or getting physical therapy so it took longer for me than somebody else quite possibly Hi there is no way we can tell you via the internet whether this treatment was appropriate or not as all injuries and people are different Here is some information on

in your cheek Please dont delay Go see your dentist as soon as you can You must call your dentist I deliver new crowns every day and there should be no pain after the cementation At most a very mild soreness after the cement is removed By the next day all should be back to normal Having severe gum pain after delivery of a crown is not normal Please call your dentist It sounds like water retention

worth checking out We are 4 weeks postop and have lots of complications If you are uncomfortable then it is worth checking out I have also had this problem and i am allergic to latex I would strongly suggest using non latex condoms from now on If it still continues to hurt to the point you dont want to urinate i would go to a gynecologist Or the health department if you dont want your parents to find out I would go to the hospital immediately You probably had an allergic reaction Sounds like a bacterial infection Get an antibiotical ointment or cream for the penis Give it five day to a week to heal Also dont wash the penis with soap I know that you wish to teach him cleanliness but there is a possibility that soap could be caught between the penis and the foreskin causing bacteria to build up Warm water on a cloth is good penis health Keep a relationship with your pediatric doctor just in case the ointment or cream does not help Update The cut is healing over with a scab but there

httponlyandroidapkcomfifa14fullunlockedapk httponlyandroidapkcomhowtoinstallandroidgamesfrompctoyourphone the hache with the light and stuff sounds like a migraine but the swollen lip either could be a bite an absess or their allergic to something they ate so back track and try to remember exactly what they ate they sound like it may be an allergy I would a see a doctor asap I know this must be really scary The tact I usually take in these situations is that I try not to let my imagination run wild and not think the worst I am so glad that he is going to the doctor I did see this article on Crohns Disease Thought it might be helpful if he had more of these sorts of symptoms httpwwwwebmdcomibdcrohnsdiseasecrohnsdiseasetccrohnsdiseasesymptoms I wish you all the best Sounds like you are allergic Take benadril right away If swelling continues or your throat starts closing go to ER right away Some soiders can cause deadly bites Did you keep the spider i have sorness to the touch on my right side about 2 below the armpit I do not feel any lumps The tenderness comes and goes when I touch the area it feels like it is along the upper part of my rib cage swelling in the body is edema See a specialist specifically a gastroenterologist Its important not to let it wait too long As one of member previously said light to throat and find any white or block dots if it is severe consult the doctor you could possibly have a deep vein thrombosis blocking blood flow to your lower legs in other words it could be a blood clot you should get to the doctor and have him do a doppler asap when any infection is present in you body your immune system kicks in you may not even know that the infection was there in the first place and sometimes your lymph nodes can remain swollen indefinitely if you have been to your doctor and all the tests came back clear i would not worry if they start to increase in size then i would return to the doctor if there was any underlying problems they would have surfaced before now no when you have any vaccination your bodys immune system fights the vaccine this is how our body becomes immune the reddness and soreness is just your bodys defences this discomfort should only last for 3 to 4 days If however you start to notice a high temperature then i suggest you contact your doctor cat scratches can be serious keep the wound clean and be aware that there may be an infection there if you start to feel ill cold like symptoms i would contact the doctor i have already given an answer but feel i must advice you to seek medical attention if your leg is leaking fluid there is an infection if left too long the infection can travel to other parts of your body so please go to the hospital Anytime I have swelling I alternate Ice and Heat if possible I also take naproxen which over the counter is aleve Take two aleve Ice it for 15 mins then heat of 15 Another option is to ice it then put on ice hot or sportrub It will help relax the muscles causing the swelling as well Youll need to go to the doctor With abnormal discharge you could have an infection I recommend seeing a Dr since symptoms can be very similar between numerous types of vaginal infections It could be something as simple as a yeast infection Or it could be a symptom of a STD or other more severe problem Automatically treating for a yeast infection can increase discomfort and hinder proper treatment options of some other infections Its best to have a swab test done to find out EXACTLY what infection you might have and get exactly the treatment you need do you have a history of neck problems Do you have any history of heart problems or high blood pressure or cholesterol Compare your symptoms with cervical neuropathy and for cardiac arrest I think it has more to do with your neck but you didnt give much info and I want to make sure you check cardiac issuesjust in case Only YOUR body can cause an allergic reaction Your body is reacting to something it views as a threat or invader A bite cant cause an allergy but it can cause your body to have a reaction The prior bite is probably unrelated to your symptoms Especially since it happened 3 months ago and youre still having issues Keep in mind that you can develop an allergy at any point Example Perhaps you drink Orange Juice every day3 times a day You can even develope an allergy in the same day Imagine drinking the first and second glass of OJ and be just fine Then you could drink the third glass and have a reaction Because of your eye symptoms it makes me think its more likely youre allergic to something in the air Im sure youve heard of hayfever However latex allergies can be very dangerous Lets say you have a SEVERE reaction and need to go to the Emergency Room Guess what The Drs and nurses will be touching you with latex gloves which would make it worse You need to be tested to find out your allergen What it is thats causing your bodys reaction You can have your doctor test you or even use one of the home allergy tests they have on the market now CONSTANT eye drainage should always be checked If you have possibly damaged your cornea it could be leaking out slowly It is very important to have it checked by your eye doctor In some cases it is just allergies to something in the air It can also be a problem with the tear ducts But if it contiues with no let up DO see a doctor You could also have something called Cellulitus which left untreated can be fatal it is a form of staph and requires some atibiotics  if there is redness swelling and it feels like the skin has a fever then you should go see a doctor It is possible that you have a fracture or break I would not take anything other than Tylenol without approval from your doctor Generally that is all you are allowed to take for pain but it will not reduce swelling I would suggest elevating your ankle above your heart and using ice On for 10min off for 30 Just remember to wrap a towel around the ice pack so damage to your nerves and vessels does not occur from the cold Bad news is around that stage in pregnancy you will most likely be experiencing ankle swelling anyway which could complicate the ankle pain a bit Hang in there Frequent drinking of hot beverages that contain caffeine like coffee and any kind of hot tea No Yes I would go to the ER if the pain is worse Do you have any other symptoms When did the pain start Radiating heat around the sting sights as well as reddening and swelling is normal for the amount of stings and being from a wasp As a fact you can have the same problems with just one sting However you are doing the right things medically as you can May take 3 days to a week for the heat and swelling to subside I would not exercise right away And if you have not had an xray of it to make sure there is no fracture Keep it elevated until the swelling goes down It may take weeks for the bruises to go away If you exercise on it now The swelling may get worse Suggest you get an xray of it to be sure there is no fracture first Usually just a lubrication like liquid dish soap will do the job No water Just a dish soap like Dawn or Joy Apply it above and below to get it under the ring And start moving the ring up and down the finger turning it as you do it And it should slide off can some one help me With a muscle spasm if bad enough you can have bruising and some swelling but to me it sounds like when the muscle spasmed it may have ripped or torn a muscle or tended maybe even closed something off like a blood vessel or artery but you are doing the right thing by making and going to the doctor and specialist it my take some time but Im sure everything well work out great I really hope this helps thank you and good luck to you and yours Have you been to the dentist It could be an abscessed tooth in your upper jaw As a layperson but with experience I highly recommend avoiding hormones as they can lead to cancer and estrogen based cancer has occurred in people I know Depending on your age and reason please defer to your doctors as it is very serious i have two compressed fractures confirmed from MRI and Neruosrgeionspine I can after weeks short walk and mostly bed rest use a cane I highly recommend you ask your doctor and your body will tell you major pain at least for me you must see a doctor immediately or er or urgent care center I speak from experience but I am a layperson nerve damage to your hand I have this problem also all the time for years now and take Furosemide and Hydrochlorothiazide for this but I am also having to really lower my intake of sodium and get a lot more exercise Too much salt and not getting enough exercise WILL cause swelling and numbness and tingly sensation in feet ankles legs face hands and fingers Also a pinched nerve in the neck andor lower back will cause this as well I cannot sleep on my back without waking up with my face eyes hands and fingers swollen numb and tingling and this is because I have had 3 herniated disks in my neck and even with epidural shots in the disks to take the swelling off the nerves the pressure of sleeping on my back causes the disks to press against the nerves which will cause all the swelling and numbness The major thing though is the salt intake amount and lack of exercise When I cut out the salt and move around more by cleaning house gardening mowing the lawn get on my exercise bike and work at the restaurant and try not to stay on my back at night when sleeping the swelling and fluid retention is reduced tremendously Also drinking at least 10 16 ounce glasses of water everyday is a big help towards this My prescription water pills which are also BP meds plus all that drinking of water everyday usually will knock out all that swelling and numbness I hope this helps you because I know how uncomfortable and miserable all this swelling makes you feel This is more common than you think and not serious Avoid tight clothing such as jeans and apply warm compresses and it should clear up in a few days yes I would say its probably infected Yes It could be a recurrence of the same problem Wear your brace Internist sounds like a infections Could be caused by bacteria infection in the intestinal track Id take him to see a doctor asap it could be from your socks or shoes try getting diabetic socks or shoes or just the regular shoes that are wide with i mean i am not a doctor but i have heard if other people doing that It sounds similar to some sensations I get from FibromylagiaIf the sensation is like a burn and it makes it hard to move your muscles sometimes I would do some research on other fibromylagia symptoms and see if it matches up Good luck Most of the time people do not react to bedbug bites Because of this alot of people who have them dont even know it My wife and I had to deal with an infestation My wife reacted to the bites which caused intense itchyness but not much else I however did not react or feel anything You can a trap to see if you have an infestation and if you catch one youll know I hope this helps and good luck could be a local infection you may want to see a doctor I had the same problem with my thumb and 2 fingers next to it It was caused by a blood clot they dissolved the clot and the two fingers cleared up rapidly but the thumb hasnt cleared up yet I will have to go back to be checked for another clot or possibly gangerine Rod when I was a preteen boy we rather than be caught riding a girls bikeand the crossbar was perfect for giving girl or a friend a ride home from school Its a shame present day kids are growing up in such overprotective little fun but safe times Little wonder the kids are growing up as couch potatoes And dont get me started on the removal of diving boards from swimming pools Poor kids it sounds like an infection try alcohol and cleaning it soak it in warm water with salt also take an alergy pill just in case if you have them worstcase senario you might have an alergy to whatever scratched you but i general is just sounds like an infection Here is some more info about myself I was in a long term safe sex relationship in college After that I had protected sex with two Asian girls at a spa I dont think the condom broke but Im not 100 percent positive I havent had any kind of sexual intercourse in over one year About 3 or 4 weeks ago I did get a table shower at an Asian spa No intercourse of any kind but she did scrub my erect penis quite hard with a spongy thing during the table shower I also have red spots on the left side of my public region near where my waistband rests They do not really seem to be raised and they are not puss filled The spots only seem to annoy me when my waist band rubs them I never noticed and bumps or anything on my penis or scrotum before I have noticed different kinds of bumps and rashes in my pubic area where my waistbelt sits in the past Could this all be related to the possible fungal infection or do I have an std NO You have a different problem going From my daughters experiences possible nerve impingemen in prone position It can possibly But only from killing any bacteria that has grown in or around the area most likely you should just have them removed tonsils can cause a lot of pain when inflamed you are also more likely to get tonsilitis and other infections because of them i had to have mine removed because they were the size of golf balls and i missed a yr of school bc of it so my advice see a doc and let him decide but stay away from chips they will and can get caught in your tonsils if they are swollen enough js from experience YES GO BACK IMMEDIATELY i had it after a c section and it can spread to other parts of your body that are compromised the doc will give you more meds take them all and watch for signs of it happening again now that you know what to look for thats my advice coming from my own experience If it grows rapidly in size and is extremely hard and painful it could be MRSA or Staph infection However if it is staying the same size it may just be an ingrown hair Ingrown hairs can get infected and become staph so make sure you clean it and not mess with it I may turn the salt shaker one time only once in a while but mostly I do not use salt the only salt I keep is sea salt Good sea salt that dissolves instantly We use too much salt A friend of mine had these symptoms and was diagnosed with diabetes  low blood pressure I have had a lot of fire ant bites when I lived in FL Some discomfort My wife on the other hand had problems She would get mild swelling and depending on bitea red line would show up and and would spread towards Thyroid Glands to expel I found once bitten put nail polish on it let dry then peel it offIt pulls everything out Benedryl helped her too But this is what we did You are the one to make any decision following your Health Had this huge thing inside the inner lip for the last month I thought it was a blood blister but my ENT said it was a mucous plug Its very painful httpwwwnewdentalimagescom I have a swollen gland on only one side of my neckI also have recently be diagnosed with a skin allergycould there be a connection Do you detox your system every season three to four times a year also are you drinking plenty of water and watch what you eat ContinuedYesterday it became swollen again in the morning I was in pain it was itchy it was still swollen It later got extremely better at the end of the day No more signs of cold sores and significantly less swollen But this morning I wake up and it is huge again I am continuing to take Valtrex But I have no idea it is it even my cold sores doing this Please help Ive avoided food that I ate the first day considering allergens Please help I have a midterm in two hours this might be a tooth problem or TMJ problems I have a node behind my ear and one on my neck that is sore and larger then usual My one year old has never been properly diagnosed with Eczema but his pediatrician has told me he has a feeling thats what he has About a month ago my sons finger became extremely inflamed and during this time his eczema has flared up extremely bad on his knees and the back of his legs We spent the first week in and out of the ER 5 times The first visit they lanced his finger It got worse so the second visit they had a hand surgeon come in a sedate him to lance it again After almost a week on antibiotics and it being drained it did not get better The size increased and the redness down his finger was spreading The 5th time going to the ER they admitted him to the hospital and put him on IV antibiotics They sent us home the next day and just changed his antibiotics I hate his little body being filled with these drugs that dont seem to be doing anything His skin began to peel off his finger and it seemed to get better for about a week but now his finger is swelling again and extremely red They told me it was paronychia at first then a felon and herpetic whitlow I feel they have misdiagnosed him because its going on over a month now and he is still going through this Ive had friends and family tell me it looks like he has MRSA Has anyone dealt with anything like this Is there a link between Eczema and whatever is going on with his finger Who should I seek out for this because the surgeon and his doctor havent been very helpful Why is this recurring so quickly He has an appointment tomorrow with his pediatrician He is my first baby and Im very worried and not sure where to look for the next step He was on septra cephalexin and acyclovir the first go round and he was taking them multiple times a day He is now on acyclovir and cephalexin again but only once a day this time His cheeks have also been very red the past few days as well but no fever lubricate dry tissue and surrounding area problem wpatella This is very strange as I have heard of people having severe allergic reactions to fire ant bites however I have never heard of a case where the reactions lasted as long as five years I would go to the doctors just to make sure there is nothing else that could be causing this I have the same issue happening to me right now I broke my leg just above my ankle in 1999 and ever since I have had issues around the platescrews site The doctor told me that what is most likely going on is over time the screws begin to loosen and even if they loosen just the tiniest fraction it is enough to rub against soft tissue and cause irritation He told me the best way to take care of this is to have it taken out which for me right now is not an optionno insurance no go So when it flares up I have to stay off my feet as best I can ice it elevate it and take an antiinflammitory That is what he told me to do if it looks like the stitchs could be pulled apart or if theres pain due to swelling id go to the ER exercise depends where you stitchs are located im sure Knee replacement is painful for about 46 monthsthere will be some swelling and the clicking is normal I had a full replacement in 2005 and I am now 59 years old The main thing is to keep doing your therapyeven though it is painful it will pay off in the end You have to have a good therapist to get through thisand you have to push yourself hard to maintain minimum loss of usage in your knee While I still have some problems with it especially when it is cold I managed to retain 87 per cent usage of my knee I can straighten it out completely but cannot do a deep knee bend No Pain No Gain i work in a dental office and it sounds like you have ulcerated the gum tissue from the seeds the mouth heals rather quickly i would rec rinsing with warm salt water for a couple of days if not any better you should see your dentist swelling from ankles to knees till my lower legs are wider then my knees try adding real lemon to your water and drink as much as you can tolerate and rinse your mouth with organic coconut vinegar before swallowing it dont swallow often as this tends to lower your blood sugar level greatly this technique will help clear infection or toxins out of your body and if taken routinely will help prevent future infections for the most part if there is pain you will find by placing a piece of clove a spiceherb under the tongue where the bump is or if thats too painful put it between your cheek and gum and kinda let sit there for as long as you tolerate it has a numbing affect drinking and gargling with organic coconut vinegar and putting real lemon in your drinking water will help cleanse and rid your body of any toxins followed routinely will help prevent future infections yes if there is a muscle you worked you did tear it If its the ankle ice with elevating the feet is the treatment Also you should support the ankle by wrapping it with bandage or immobilize it with ankle wrapsupport if you need to move around If its the arch stop putting pressure on it and let it heal usually if it is dislocated chiropractor needs to place it back in place then put a cast or something to immobilize it to heal it properly you probably need a x ray then the doctor would decide after seeing the result if it is dislocated and you do nothing it can heal but may be misaligned I have the same problem and I found out im allergic to latex i think i have the same thing swollen bottom lipcold sores jeadaches and my eyes hurt and fever for two days that will come and go they told me it was herpes but i dont believe it Um that sounds like pink eye or another type of eye infection I strongly suggest scheduling an appointment to see you ophthalmologist some time It could be chronic hepatitis B need to see your doctor yes it could bee I had the same symptoms It started on my hand and went to my feet After going to various doctors I was diagnosed with a rare fungal infection that can be transferred from dogs to humans in rare cases I cant find anything about it on WebMD or from any of my current drs Ive started to call  ask vets since after my diagnosis the local vet diagnosed the family dog with the skin infection the tx for mas was a high dose of ingested Lamisil 9pill form which can be bad for your liver as well Your ear buds may be irritating your ears It sounds like they are too big for your ears I had this problem growing up from my hearing aids The molds would be too big and hurt my ears Try headphones with the earpiece that goes over your ears not inside them You can still buy them this way It is healthier for your ears and your ear buds may even be contributing to your ear infections  Not necessarily Our skin becomes thinner when we age Sun exposure may cause skin thinning so it is very important that you stay out of the sun and use sunblock for skin protection You may see a board certified dermatologist like Dr Eric Schweiger to help you about this You may speak with a dermatologist about that particular concern of yours Dr Eric Schweiger is a member of the American Academy of Dermatology and the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery He may help you with that You have to make sure that you are properly washing your ears everyday with mild soap and water You may also apply some topical medications that you can purchase over the counter You may speak with a dermatologist about that particular concern of yours Dr Eric Schweiger a board certified dermatologist may help you with that Clear Clinic  httpwwwclearcliniccom It will be best to speak with a medical professional who can help you with that For the meantime you may wear comfortable clothes that will not irritate the area NO YOU HAVE TO GO TO YOUR DOCTOR THERE SHOULDNT NORMALLY BE A BUMP SOMETHINGS WRONG YES u are not alonemy mother and I and other members of my family get them on their arms it started as we got older we dont know why they are exactly perfectly circular but I think as we age our skin thins and we bruise easilya bruise is just bleeding under the skin if u find an answer to the perfect circle id like to know same thing for me one sting one black wasp on my leg hurt but later very big I suggest u consult your dr u will probably need an epinephrine pen to carry that is an allergy to that wasp if you get stung multiple times you could be in serious trouble as for now benedryl and baking soda water paste and cortisone cream for itching is good but be prepared just in case it happens again sometimes your first reaction is a warning and can be life threatening after that by the way i got tested for arthritis and they said i didnt have it Ok if it was red at first and turned black I would assume that you may have gotten bit by somethingspider Also is it painful If its painful I would definitely think that its a spider bite because depending on what kind of spider it is most of the time when you get bit it will turn red at first like a pimple but the reason its turning black is that its a poisonous DONT PICK AT IT If you keep messing with it which I know sometimes is hard to do but without actually physically seeing it and assuming its a spider bite if you keep picking at it and messing with it than you can actually develop MRSA which would be bad So if it doesnt get better within give or take a few days to a week ask your doctor But what we did as a home remedy is we took a glass bottle of some kind and boiled it and stuck it over the infected spot to get the poison to release Hope I was some kind of help But yeah if it doesnt get better call your doctor the question is why havnt you gone already That  i dont think is normal and you should go prontoNOW you should take her to the hospitalShe may have something like bark or dirt in there and it can clog the tear duct So you should get it checked out before it does any major damage i have chronic mononucleosis and have all these symptoms but i usually have a fever for about a week before i have another attack I AM NOT A DOCTOR but I can tell you that you should see one infections need to be cleaned out and the puss needs to be drained for now Id say to give it a hydrogen poeroxide soak and to put some antibiotic ointment on it then wrap it up in a band aid or gauze until you can get to a doctor or clinic I know you wanted to do this all at home but it might be better to see a doctor now After all I assume you like your thumb and wouldnt want it amputated if it gets worse Check in with your general practioner or local medical clinic Its probably infected IM NOT A DOCTOR BUT AM STUDYING BASIC MEDICINE It might be ear wax that is coming out while your sleeping and then as you move around it goes back into your inner ear Thats just my opinion though I suggest when you wake up clean out your ears not going to deep could damage inner ear as well as using ear drops also known as ear wax removal aid That can be a pain in the butt when first using it just make sure you read the directions carefully It does work pretty well for me anyways sounds like FLUID RETENTION I have the samething all the time nearly I would definitely use an inflammatory  That reduces the swelling I had the same symptoms twice which were excruciating I almost killed the ambulance it was so bad I was diagnosed with Diverticulitis I had to have emergency surgery  a colon resection It was explained that depending upon the length of my intestine it would determine if the portion that was inflamed was cut would there be enough to reattach If not then I would have to have a colostomy I was lucky I didnt need that However the symptoms returned a couple of years after that surgery and another procedure was done No no colostomy It is very important to keep the intestines clean as much as possible  water and veggies help a lot as well as fruits Any abdominal pain is never to be ignored It is not for you to determine if it is gas or not Any self diagnosis could prove more harmful and could be fatal See the doctor right away or go to the ER no also doctor can check for blood clot But usually you will have more increased warmth in that area But its safer to be checked out then to have a clot travel to your lungs which can be a big problem Better to be safe You also could have injured your muscles from walking differently then normal with the blister any antibiotic can potentially cause a yeast infection you might want to phone your doctor to see what heshe suggests for the itchingpainburning there are quite a few over the counter creams for external use but because of being pregnant you should check with your OB before using them hope this helps I had that happen several years ago my Doctor diagnosed it as a hernia they do a wait and see with it if it doesnt go away it is repairable with surgery so a visit to your medical provider is suggested hope my answer helps you Seek medical attention If it feels hot it may be infected  if you still have some symptoms you should see a doctor i also recommend seeing an insectologist sometimes they take a test to see what bite you do not think of mosquito bite that simple  and for the next time do not try to irritate the bitten place with rubbing it to much here are some good tips Take a hpt and then follow up with your Gyn  Have you changed anything Detergent softeners new clothes wout washing first new bed just about anything including a once not allergic to a food allergy is he on antibiotics My now 10 then 8 went through this he broke out every day for 3 days once covered half of his body however benadryl made it go away so it saved me trips to the ER i did take pictures and give them to my sons pediatrician  It was around Halloween time and it stopped as fast as it started The closest I came to figuring it out was it was either the detergent so i switchedor his 2 costumes  try to think of anything thats different new activity with new surroundings anything Also hives can be caused by stress this too has happened as well to my son 12 is middle school and a hard age Good luck to you soak your foot in epison salt and hot waterhot enough that you wont burn yourself 3 times a day the red spots are probably small broken blood vessels when your not soaking rub mineral ice and wrap in ace bandage you should be good to go in week or so and you should take some ibuprofen 2x a day as wellif no improvement go to doctor you probably have circulation problems If you are having constipation or bowel movements with it it could just be IBS Drink lots of water and increase your fiber intake Go to a doctor and get it check out to be on the safe side these are all symptoms of an infection you should see your doctor as soon as possible i would go back to the er  dont wait for the doctor appt cause swelling is a bad problem he could have a knotted vien wrapped around his testicals which if left untreated can cause it to be cut out its common for dotors in the er to dismiss thing s not cause they dont care but at level of importnce being someone who got shot would have priority over ur son but if is getting worse n hes in pain go back to the er  tell them u have an appointment but ur sons in bad pain n cant wait  hope hes okay  n i hoped this helped i dont know truely based on your past history  if it was unrealated i was think its just clean and or maybe u have heathly olis in ur skin but if you feel its cause for concern call ur doctor  i would think itf ur skin is thin that would would see ur vains very easy  and with that prob get cut easy also  but in my gut i dont think its thin skin  hope this helped you need to see an experienced doctor to give you the turn your head and cough while he is squeezing your testes seems like a forgotten art in the medical world make sure he knows his business and is honest take the time to tell him exactly whats going on in your life and body like any accedents or exercises that may have contributed to your condition I should have went to med school think carefully and be very honest and exact Beg him to be honest and sincere make sure he earns his money I have experienced something similar in the past It may very well be a canker sore Be aware of signs of infection Also watch for signs of spreading over entire palette throat and tongue Mine turned out to be thrush a yeast infection of the mouth There are many causes I wanted to avoid medication so my doctor recommended I try eating yogurt Activia and drinking yogurt smothies found at the store The whiteness pain and redness was completely gone after the first 48 hours He had me continue the yogurt daily for 10 days There are medications topical that you drink so if dont see improvement see your doc to be sure youre on the right track If it is a bacterial infection the yogurt wont help at all Canker sores often respond to citric acids drinking juice or lemonade however that is painful Hope this helps Get into a dr asap never know what going on But that a few signs somethings not right Hope all turns out Sounds like edema Lots of homepathic things can be done for this First lower the amount sodium in your diet Also if you dont alreadyhave them try compression stockings or socks You can find mild to moderate ones at you local department store Standing for long periods of time can cause the swelling to increase so try to limit the time you are on your feet When you are sitting elevate your legs Its a great excuse to sit in you recliner If the swelling continues gets painful or you notice any sores on your legs or feet see your doctor Sounds like an allergic reation to me as well Most allergic reactions can be treated with meds such as zyrtec allergra claritin or benydral Id start with one of those Just follow the directions on the box However if your throat starts to close or you have difficulty breathing get to an ER right away Take him ASAP I was bitten when a teenager in the bend of elbow Had a bubble full of puss Had to have it lanced seeped puss for days Take him to a doctor as soon as possible Ticks carry lyme disease Better safe than sorry Try an electric Massager on the bottom of your foot and slowly up your calf works for me Also after cancer surgery  It depends on what kind of spider bit you I have had this happen with both black widow and brown recluse bites I would check with my regular doctor if I were you if you have had an injury there could be a blood clot Even without injury could be a blood clot especially if you a more sedantary lifestyle I sounds like he damaged the ligaments under the knee Which only hurts when you pressure on the knee like kneeling of touching He should get it checked out soon The longer he waits the worse it will become because of inflammation under the knee This will cause the knee to eventually lock in a slight bent position and then it will be difficult to move and that is something that you do not want Dont ice it brisk  wlking Heat is ok Ive that too Go see ortho Ive did the lock the facets injection and physio Its getting better But after the injection ive mood swings Spine is better now I had a situation where one eye became larger than the other The actual eyeball looked bigger and jutted out more Opthomologist said it was actually the Meuller muscle on outside of eyelid that contracted slightly and pulled lid up and out This was due to a thyroid problemI had hypothyroidism and didnt know it Doctor called it TEDthyroid eye disease To my knowledge there are 5 types of herpestype viruses Herpes type 1 is cold sores Type 2 is sexually transmitted as in genital Type 3 I believe is chicken pox Type 4 is herpes zoster which is shingles Not sure but I dont believe any of these would cause joint pains The only one I dont know about is type 5 CMV Cytomeglovirus Not sure about the spelling but thats close enough for you to do a google searchor a webMD search Hope this helps Cant speak directly to a pilonidal cyst close to the tailbone but in my experience working in urgent cares and assisting in minor surgeries like that these cysts are lanced drained and packed with some string cant remember the name but left to heal from the inside out with the postop care including pulling the packing string out slowly It continues to drain pus butheals from the inside out Eventually you pull all the packing out keep it clean and after a few weeks its healed Im guessing this iswas a sebatious gland cyst Sounds like it healed over and reoccurred Golf ball size sounds like it didnt heal from the inside out Needs drained again surgically Eye problems and sex drive arent directly related probably It would put me in a bad mood too  Ouch Well most likely either contact dermatitis from either antipersperant detergent or fabric softener or razor irritation or a combination of both If youre right handed and it didnt happen in the left armpit but did happen in the right armpit might indicate that youre less competent shaving with your left hand Just a wild guess Doesnt sound serious Lay off the shaving for a few days and also the antipersperant If youre using the same detergent for a long time chances are you arent allergic to it But you CAN develope an allergy even after a while A lot of BP meds have diuretics already in them In mild hypertension sometimes just the diuretic is enough to get you back in the safe zone Just be careful with lasix 40mg you deplete potassium thru your urine and have to have a potassium suppliment so you dont get deficient and get leg cramps or worse heart palpatations Check with your doc to see if your meds have a diuretic If youre swelling you might need a higher dose You might need to lay off the salt I do have this symptoms occasionally with some serious pain in my gums and then it disappears I consulted my Doctor about this and he told me to that it could result from the medication I was taken to threat the sinus ailment Thanks AFTER KNEE REPLACEMENT I FELT IT WOULD BE NORMALIN TIMEIVE HAD TWO OTHER OTHROSCOPIC KNEE SURGERYS AND FOUR SHOULDER OPERATIONSTHEY ALL HEALED 100MY SUREGON SAID TWO YEARSNOW MY NEW DRSAYS IT WILL ALWAYS DO THAT Considering you had your baby in February I am assuming that your placenta was removed shortly therafter If so it is quite a few months afterwards so you shouldnt have any bruising You would have notice bruising shortly after having your placenta removed Since you have the bloating I would follow up with your physician  I went to the doctor 18 months ago for sever pain associated with a lump in the scrotum located where I had a 1985 vasectomy The Dr immediately prescribed antibiotics and mentioned Epididymitis as common with vasectomy The pain lessened but did not fully go away Tests Blood and UA could not be definitive as I had started antibiotics Pain while much less and not constant continues Various tests and UAs over the following months for discharges also did not show anything I am 57 years old and it is hard to tell if mild urinary conditions weaker and more frequent flow are related Pain in and the lump itself is the only definitive symptom The original Dr referred me to a urologist and between the two of them hernia and kidney stones were thought to be the culprit However it is apparent to me the source of pain is the peasized lump My desire to remove it by cutting it out as in redoing the vasectomy procedure is not well met ignored PS Yes my sex life is suffering but only in direct relationship to the ebb and flow of pain good days and bad daysAlso my wifes health seems unaffected by mine although I am not sure what to look for to indicate transmission Sexually transmitted disease was tested for to be ruled out My question Can Epididymitis reoccur or be misdiagnosedtreated so lumppain is less yet remains 18 mo of variable pain continues Do Iwe ask for a different drug redo the Cipro regiment or even suggest a heavierlonger regiment Please anyone respond if they have suggestionsHope to hear your condition resolved herpes and swelling are not synonimous Herpes is more like a rash swelling  in my case when it occurs  goes away with topical dermatological cream like for example  Mupicorin ointment Bumps and pimples ARE NOT HERPES Herpes is usually a much more severe thing Because there are so many tick born ailments I think its important that you watch her closely for the next week or so Make sure you take temp 2xs a day and watch for rashes anywhere on the body What usually causes swelling and pain in both feet and legs is water retention I have the same problem and I take water pills to help reduce the fluid that my body does not release on its own You can cut down on your salt intake as well as talk to your doctor The swelling in your legs could also be an early sign of Congestive Heart Failure CHF Ibuprofen will help with the pain as well as the inflammation I hope this has helped answer your question this is called edema and can be cause by many things i suggest u look up what can cause edema of the extremeties  I would talk to your Dr maybe something else going on I have had several seizures and have yet to know what I do I remember the room getting dark then I see nothing and it seems like a just a few seconds and I am ok but I never remember it and I have been told that it lasted a few minutes not seconds Absolutely take him to a doctor It may be nothing but it may be a life threatening condition My 14 year old daughter had similar to what symptoms you describe and it was lymphoma Doctor first insisted it is just strep throat and with this it is common for all lymph nodes in body to swell and to have elevated temp Gave her antibiotics I kept calling doctor and nurse telling them it is getting worse and was told each time to wait that it will get better Several days later she could barely walk due to sever swelling and pain and I took her in demanding she be seen They found it to be cancer Dont wait Use common sense and listen to mothers intuition if what doctor tells you does not seem right Take him to the ER if you cant get in to doctors office because of lack of insurance Insist he be seen i dont know and would like to  You said you were walking around afterwards this means nothing is broken Internal bruising can take up to several months to heal It sounds like the bruise made its way to the surface hence the swelling This is good Keep doing what youre doing and give it time Avoid the doctor bill especially with feet theres nothing much a doc can do even if it were broken Could possibly be sinus infection Take some of the new Advil allergy and congestion pills available Box is yellow and green says New at top Other than that possibly need to go to doctor or clinic or er Not sure if hay fever but I get the same feelings Advil allergy and congestion will work for hay fever too Better to try then not to You only get I think 10 pills for 600 and I buy them at DG store Dollar Store One every 46 hours as needed Try it other than that I dont know Possibly a allergic reaction or maybe a med interference I have never been able to get any over the counter migraine meds to work besides excederine tension and i was put on fioricet which helped I would say a different ingredient whether inactive or active is in the off brand Nothing really compares to the original I dont remember anything I was shopping with
