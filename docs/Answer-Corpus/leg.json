has the doctor sent him to see a rheumatoid doctor as his problem could be some thing else and not arthritis Are you a man if so so you need your prostate checked as if it is enlarged this will cause the problem A wide range of extra intestinal complications may compose a portion of the clinical picture Neurological dysfunction is an infrequent but potentially devastating extra intestinal manifestation of Crohn disease Virtually all components of the nervous system both central and peripheral may become involved I think I know exactly what you are talking about Even if I bend stoop climb stairs too much I tend to get red dots blood splatter in my legs I have autoimmune issues but basically healthy and wondered if that causes these events The pooling of blood goes away after two to three days unless it breaks out really bad then it takes a little longer before it clears Sometimes it makes my legs throb but no real serious pain is associated with the breakouts Again any pressure of stress put on my legs causes this It would be good to see a competent orthopedic specialist They have many tests such as xrays CT scans MRIs discograms that can help diagnose your

state of fluid overload This can be caused by many conditions including heart disease liver disease kidney disease emotional stress electrolyte imbalance and dietary intake of certain substances especially sodium It is recommended that you notify your doctor of the edema resulting in leg swelling You may need additional treatment for those underlying causes of the fluid overload Additionally you may require additional diuretics to help your body in eliminating the excess fluid According to a WebMd article monitoring your fluid intake can reduce complications and hospitalizations Too much fluid in your body can make it harder for an alreadyweakened heart to pump Your doctor may prescribe a diuretic to help get rid of excess fluid He or she may also suggest that you limit liquids so that your body can get rid of the extra water and sodium Now lets attach a specific answer to your question Many medical experts agree that a normal human should consume liquids in the daily range of 812 cups or 64 ounces  96 ounces The amount of fluids consumed is also influenced by your age gender height and weight An example based strictly on a persons weight and using an accepted formula of pounds times 05 ounces will equal fluid ounces per day might result in something like the following 150 pound person times 05 ounces s 75 ounces per day For patients taking diuretics the maximum daily volume of fluid probably is best determined by their doctor Some authorities suggest that patients on diuretic medications during periods of fluid overload should consume 48 ounces of spacedout fluids per day and not to exceed 64 ounces in a day Fluids include such items as JellO and Puddings But every situation is different depending on the causes of the fluid overload Since the formula for consuming fluids while taking diuretics is somewhat complex it is best to talk with your doctor Many physicians will not reduce the daily intake of fluids instead focusing on eliminating sodium intake Here is what an article by WebMd says about that point Fluid usually is not restricted in heart failure unless you have advanced or severe heart failure Usually restricting sodium intake alone is enough to help your body get rid of extra fluids The entire article may be viewed at httpwwwwebmdcomheartdiseaseheartfailurewatchingyourfluidintakewhenyouhaveheartfailure I hope that this answer has been helpful   Wow how unfortunate You and your mother have been through a great ordeal Yes there are natural foods spices beverages fruits and vitamins that holistic and natural medicine physicians feel will cause the blood to thin However there are no guarantees  Therefore if blood thinners like Coumadin or Heparin are prescribed for a heart condition or strokeblood clot prevention do not automatically discontinue their administration Instead first talk with your moms doctors about alternatives such as natural dietary influences that may aid in thinning of the blood as follows In general avoid food that are rich in Vitamin K and instead choose foods rich in Vitamin E and foods plentiful in salicylates like cabbage and avocados Some foods vitamin supplements and spices may help in thinning of the blood and include fish oil ginkgo garlic ginger legumes lentils oats oranges paprika pomegranate juice raisins cayenne cherries tart cherry juice and  grapes I hope that your mothers condition improves quickly and that my answer has been helpful  Yes Parkinsons disease patients can become afflicted with some forms of cancer Your general practicing was correct but only revealed part of the complete answer Numerous studies have shown a protective neuron responsible for protects Parkinsons patients from some types of cancer The missing part was that some of those same studies showed a pronounced increase in cancer of the prostate skin cancers and other cancer types in patients diagnosed with Parkinsons disease I hope that this answer has been helpful and that youre feeling well Sideeffects do occur with Naproxen and are categorized as common less common  rareAccoring to Drugscom  I would notify the prescriber to determine if a sideeffect is in playing a role in your knee pain Below is the link for an article on restless leg syndrome published in WebMD httpwwwwebmdcombrainrestlesslegssyndromerlscauses As youll note vitamin and mineral deficiencies such as iron vitamin B12 and magnesium may be associated with RLS Another source reports that vitamin D may be helpful in treating RLS Medications such as Mirapex have been proven to be useful in treating this uncomfortable and sometimes painful disorder Problems with balance leg weakness and dragging of the heal are suggestive of a neurologic system condition I recommend that you discuss your symptoms with a physician They may refer you to a neurologist for a full workup Six months is too long for your symptoms to have gotten worse without being professionally evaluated Congratulation on achieving 82 years of life  I suggest that your make an appointment with your family doctor Explain the symptoms and receive a physical exam of the affected areas The doctor may also run blood studies to rule out nutritional deficiencies Discuss the possibility of being referred to a sleep doctor I strongly suspect that you may be affected by the conditions called restless leg syndrome and periodic limb movement These disorders may begin in childhood and slowly progress as we age There may also be a genetic component associated with the conditions Check with other family members to see if they also share your symptoms The symptoms as you describe typically begin during the evening as you relax in bed As you prepare to rest and during sleep the burning feeling muscle tighteningcramping and leg twitching intensifies It is difficult to sleep due to the uncomfortable sensations and you may suffer sleep deprivation Symptoms may also occur while sitting during car rides Diagnosing RLS and PLM is usually accomplished through a sleep study Medications such as Mirapex and Neurontin are some of treatments employed to control these painful conditions Id almost bet the house that RLS and PLM are at the root of your discomfort With proper diagnosing and treatment with Mirapex and Neurontin you should see a marked improvement in the quality of your life  I remember from a long ago taken anatomy class a muscle that sits in close proximity to the sciatic nerve It is called the pirformis muscle It is not at the top of the list for causes of sciatica but spasms originating in the pirformis muscle can cause compression of the sciatica nerve The pirformis muscle is situated as part of the lower spine and has the sciatic nerve running below it Diagnostic imaging even MRI findings may not always detect Pitiformis Syndrome It could be Sciatica although the pain may be more intense while lying down and sitting with that condition Does the pain extend down to your ankles and feet If so this is suggestive of a Sciatic Nerve disorder Back pain resulting from disc bulging pinched nerves muscle pulls other medical conditions such as growth masses  bone fractures and narrowing of the spinal column stenosis are other possibilities I suggest that you make an appointment to be evaluated by a primary care doctor This individual may review your medical history interview you for the pain quality exact location of your pain pain level flushout possible traumatic events that may have occurred prescribe medications including analgesics and antiinflammatory nonsteroidal drugsconduct blood and urine lab work  get the ball rolling with a radiographic xray This doctor may also refer you to other medical specialists In summary Lower back pain costs the American Economy large amounts of money in medical expenses lost work hours worker compensation claims doctor office visits and intense pain experienced by the patient This type of symptomology requires resolution beginning first with a clear diagnosis Once a diagnosis is established treatment efforts may be started moving from conservation forms like cortisone injections analgesics bed rest pillows placed under the knees chiropractic treatments and ice and heat treatments Although these symptoms sometimes may virtually spontaneously improve in conjunction with some conservative efforts more aggressive testing like MRIs and surgical intervention is frequently necessary It can take a lengthily time to achieve relief months or even years I wish that the process was less cumbersome and more patient friendlyUnfortunately medical insurance companies through their beancounting policies directed at cost saving make most of the bigger treatmenttesting decisions todayThe physician many time finds that their decisions are overturned by some HMO clerk following a complicated reimbursement and procedure manual These sometimes uncaring and reckless institutional decisions can delay diagnosis and the starting of treatment efforts Hopefully a cause for your symptoms will rapidly be determined but please dont count on any quick fix Best wishes for your health improvement  Neuropathy caused me to be in almost constant pain and to experience frequent falls to balance irregularities I was prescribed the prescription medication Gabapentin 600mg 3xs per day with positive results Additionally the Gabapentin has been supplemented with the prescription medication Mirapex 050 mg 3 xs per day with even more improvement With these medications I changed from a hunchedover severely disabled person with chronic pain to an erect human being with bearable pain I suggest that you not give up and locate a medical specialist willing to invest time in diagnosing your type of neuropathy and to their possibly titrating various pharmacological agents until your symptoms improve You absolutely deserve a better response than the one provided by your doctor It means that your liver is struggling to perform its duties according to your bodys requirements to regulate glycogen and filter toxins Skin discoloration may appear yellowish or jaundice and leg swelling are classic symptoms of liver cirrhosis Bleeding easily increase of blood pressure portal hypertension abdominal swelling ascites and itchy skin are other symptoms Since you have been diagnosed with cirrhosis hopefully the swelling and discoloration symptoms were explained to you in detail I suggest that you notify your hepatic specialist of any changes in your symptoms The sooner that new indicators of the disease have been treated the better the eventual outcome tends to be Best wishes for your recovery Some common causes for your three noted symptoms viewed in a collective manner may include Crohns Disease

are sometimes seen in stokes TIAs Trans Ischemic Attach head injuries and epilepsy  I admire you for seeking out a conclusive way of determining whether back injury may be caused by an auto accident Of course forceful trauma resulting from a car accident may cause back injury Equally obvious is that the Insurance company doctors will deny that herniated disc can be caused by a car accident The truth of the matter is that it is virtually impossible to prove that a car accident either caused or did not cause a back injury The entire process must start by having a candid discussion with the alleged victim Is your victims story credible Does it agree with statements included in accident reports and by their treating physicians Did they have previous back problems which never completely resolved themselves Confirm to the client that the insurance carrier will vigorously uncover all back related conditions that were experienced prior to the accident A preexisting issue with the back that was never fully resolved will certainly impact the outcome of a whiplash claim No prior complaint of back pain may strengthen the clients case but proves little Most people  50 years of age suffer from some arthritis and degenerative disc changes and not have any overt symptoms Next thing that Id pick through with a magnifying glass is the treating physicians report and scan reports Does the medical professional have the facts straight as reported to you by the client Your success will hinge on being as educated as possible concerning back problems picking away at incorrect statements and assessing truthful vs untruthful answers  The parietal bones make up the top portion of the cranium A direct blow can cause serious problems such as brain damage and skull fractures Some symptoms seen with parietal bone injuries include difficulty in processing sensory information and balance problems with a loss of coordination No two individuals are affected in the same manner with this injury and the symptoms may vary depending on which side of the brain was injured each side of the brain controls different functions Your symptoms are probably not just a coincidence but are instead a direct response to brain trauma It is recommended that you be medically assessed and seek an immediate evaluation at the local hospitals emergency room  This sensation of feeling an object s crawling on your body may have a medical basis It is known as a Tactile touch Hallucination Do not allow the term hallucination to lead you to believe that you are becoming mentally ill The other 4 senses smell sight taste and hearing may also produce their own hallucination and each has its own name For example an individual may smell an offensive odor in the absence of any environmental stimuli Olfactory Hallucination Sometimes these hallucinations are caused by brain abnormalities in the form of tumors Yes and sometimes people have emotional conditions that may cause these symptoms Below as follows are some previously answered questions by me on WebMd that may be helpful httpanswerswebmdcomanswers5052587doesmyfamilymemberreallyhaveparasitesorisitpsychosis

discuss the symptoms with your family doctor who can interview you complete diagnostic testing and refer you to other specialists My husband and I have had trouble with leg cramps especially at night and we have found that taking a teaspoon of regular yellow mustard stops the cramping immediately and it does not return My husband has actually started taking the mustard before going to bed to avoid being awakened by the cramping He says this helps him Restless legs is one issue Throad spasams are ususally caused by thorax problems It can but in most cases it can be just as simple as dehydration or over exertion Try drinking plenty of fluids and take vitamins If the cramping continues consult a doctor Drinking 14 to 12 a measuring cup of pickle juice can help to stop cramps Several coaches tell their dehydrated players to drink pickle juice when Gatorade is not available Read the odds of having a serious illness and eliminate the more common first You may have shin splints Shin splints are the common name given to any shin pain at the front of the lower leg Inadequate footwear which includes the wrong type of shoe for your running style as well as using running shoes that are just too old and have lost their support and cushioning can cause shin splints Increasing training too quickly running on hard surfaces on your toes as in sprinting and generally doing too much too soon can increase the risk of shin splints There are exercises that you can do and resting with alternating between heat and cold helps Lasix is a water pill that often causes you to lose minerals in your

localized symptoms of pain tingling or itching Typically this is seen on one side of the body A painful rash follows and it resolves within a 24 week period if no complications occur Its probably best to see your healthcare provider to get checked and appropriately diagnosed Treatments for Zoster can shorten the duration and severity of the illness but treatments needs to be started as soon as the rash appears I too am on blood pressure medicine and am very swollen in the legs ankles feet hands and fingers Not so sure that my belly isnt swollen somewhat I just read on WebMD that increasing water and cutting down on sodium and exercising is a big help I just wanted to add that I am on 2 mood stabilizers and was told that the family of drugs can be a reason for retaining fluid One of the side effects is weight gain so yay  Check all of the medicines that you take to see the side effects and then report this to your doctor like I did He cut my medicine in half Im afraid because these meds can also raise my cholesterol and my liver function which are culprits for edema as well I think Are either of you allergic to other meds Seems like my body has changed and am having allergic reactions to Chantix and Cipro and have been allergic to NSAIDS since 2005 had to go to the hospital because of the swelling in my throat  tongue Ive never had food or drug allergies before Ive also been told that Im menopausal now and that could be part of my weightgain problem but I think a lot of it is swelling Hope that we all get the swelling under control its very aggravating and causes pain in those areas after a while Sounds to me like a bruise but yellowed skin tends to be jaundice Get checked out I had been having a similar problem for quite some time It got so bad that I finally went and saw a Chiropractor He gave me 1 suggestion and I tried it It worked for a couple of nights Lay flat on your back with 1 pillow under your head and pillows on both sides of you When that stopped working for me I was then seeing a Physical Therapist She suggested that I lay on my side whichever side was more comfortable with 1 pillow under my head a pillow between my legs a small towel roll between my waist and the bed and a body pillow behind my back I have been sleeping that way for over a month now and it has been amazing I fall asleep much quicker and then I sleep really well through the night  Not sure but sounds more like a spider bite Id show it to a doctor Wow  sounds like some form of edema  I would definitely have her see a doctor Soon My first thought was low iron but if the blood tests have come back normal it could be something as simple as over use of asprin or tylenol As far ast the bruise goes if it was a deep bruise it could take a while to heal i have heard as long as a couple months if the tissue was damaged it would talk longer to heal Im not positive on this but I hope this helps   As you are telling that you are having skin colored bumps on

The first thing to do is to make sure that your husband has medical clearance for exercise before initiating a program after surgery or during his recovery Your husbands doctor or physical therapist should be able to provide example exercises but ACE Fitness also has a pretty comprehensive exercise library with a wide assortment of exercises as well My recommended course of action would be to print out some of these exercises that seem tolerable to him and show them to his doctor or physical therapist to gain his or her approval on those specific exercises Practice caution when initiating an exercise routine so that your husband doesnt aggravate his current condition or cause further injury Slow and gradual progression might be bestVisit the ACE exercise library located here httpwwwacefitnessorgexerciselibrarydefaultaspx Gluten is a protein found in wheat and grain products People on a glutenfree diet often avoid wheat rye and barley though there is also debate on whether to avoid oats as well A glutenfree diet allows for fresh fruits vegetables meatpoultryfish and many dairy products Unprocessed beans and nuts are also acceptable as well as products made with rice corn and soy If not buying fresh food its important to always read food labels to look for foods specifically labeled as glutenfree For example foods like cereal bread and lunch meat may or may not contain gluten so the only way to know for sure is to check the packaging The food industry can use gluten in many products that dont seem like they would contain gluten so its important to always read the label first Having a family history of food allergies could mean that your granddaughter may have a genetic predisposition to having food allergies as well It may be beneficial for her to try an elimination diet to identify any food allergies sensitivities or intolerances that she may have The basic premise of this eating plan is to initially restrict eating to very basic foods and then to gradually reincorporate more foods The person doing this can then better discern which foods trigger a negative response when added back into their diet Review this WebMD article for more information on elimination diets and also consult with a doctor or registered dietitian before implementing drastic dietary changes Your adductor muscles attach at the inside of your hip at the groin Although uncommon it is possible to tear one of these tendons There are actually a number of tendons that come together at this point and often you can have normal function even in the absence of one of these tendons As for the valtrex Im not an expert or anything it is important that you definitely need to check with the doc and make sure that there is no danger in you NOT taking the meds They may still require you to take them Obviously none of us are medical experts so all I can tell you is my opinion on what I would dothink if I were in your situation This could be casued by a lack of potassium Bananas are a good source Tell more info on this My husband has had 3 replacements 1st was the old way 2nd good and 3rd good The left knee is with the way the do it now They did the right one going down shaft of leg which got loses Cant take it out just did the knee It is ok but his left one is great Wouldnt change that Pad change in 10 yrs Thank you for respondingIve had hypo for 9 years but my last tsh was 01 which is new for me because in the past it was always 10 somethingSo does that make me hyper nowConfusedI am haveing some symtoms of fibro I think This just all started when I found out my thyroid was way offHelp i my daughter who is now 6 had what sounds to be the same thing your daughter is going through took 4 different doctors to find out what it was what she had was called foot hand and mouth its a infection young kids can get  look inside your daughters mouth and see if you spot the same blisters on the top back of her mouth First I would like to clarify that hydrocodone comes in 5 75 and 10 mg doses The 500 mg refers to the amount of Tylenol acetaminophen included with the narcotic Most people dont realize that narcotic pain medications such as Loratab Norco Percocet etc etc come with tylenol included Now to answer your question no you will not fail the test If it was a year ago there would be no trace of it left in your system Generally opiates narcotic pain medication completely leave the body in 34 days However standard hair follicle tests can detect the drug for as long as 90 days sometimes longer if the hair taken for the test is longer than 15 inches With the small amount that you took 3 pills is NOT alot and the length of time its been since you took them you should be fine Unless you have some REALLY long leg hair Even then I would doubt it would show up after a year Hope this helped A hernia is usually in the abdomen area This sounds like a case for your family doctor I have a friend who had bruises all over her and she never went to the doctor She passed out at home one day went into a coma and never came out til she died She had undiagnosed Leukemia GO TO THE DOCTOR  I have an appointment with a dermatologist on the 29th My General Physician didnt know after examining me just said not cancer not impetigo Its really important to moisturize effectively Sometimes just a little bit of dry skin can make your skin itchy and once you start that itchscratch cycle it can be relentless and very painful I have seen people scratch till they bleed sometimes Then when that heals it heals with discoloration and that can last a very long time especially when its below the knee which is the slowest part of the body to heal So the first and most important thing you do is to hydrate the skin This is done first in the bath or shower so a 1015 minute bath or shower You can use an oatmeal powder in the bath if you like or a gentle cleanser Then as soon as you step out just pat your skin dry so its still damp and then use a very hydrating moisturizer By this I mean a cream or an ointment not a lotion not an oil because those are too waterbased too light and will actually help you lose more water from the skin So you need something more rich and emollient On top of that you can put on a white cotton sock or even a plastic lining obviously not too tight you dont want to suffocate your leg but something thats going to help lock that moisture and water into the skin So you can put a plastic wrap on top And then put a sock over it to help really lock that moisture in and that also keeps your hands away from scratching at it Laser hair removal is truly the gold standard for removing hair on any part of the body I think it really works the best on the legs meaning that you need the fewest treatment for the longest lasting results These are called permanent However what permanent means in terms of laser hair removal means that at the end of two years you will have less hair but not no hair So some of the hairs will never come back or they will take so long to come back that it wont be in our lifetime Some of the hairs will come back sooner but will be finer and softer and when you shave they will stay gone for longer Typically it takes about six to eight treatments in order to get to that point Those treatments are done at onemonth intervals Before you have the treatment done you should shave the area so the hair is really short Waxing would remove the hair and so that wouldnt work at all So you cant wax but you can shave right before the treatment is done and then at one month you will come back and do it again and the hair will be gone for a very long time sometime forever Depending on how small they are lasers can be very effective in treating spider veins I dont recommend lasers to the external surface of the skin for treating varicose veins There are some lasers that are done within the skin by actually cutting into the vein and eliminating it that way and those are done by specialized dermatologist or vascular surgeons But lasers on the surface can be effective for the very small spider veins I have found though that for most spider veins sclerotherapy which is in injecting a specific ingredient that helps eliminate those veins works much better than lasers Once you have the smallest vessels left behind laser then works very well Also for varicose veins or the spider veins on the ankles I find laser as a treatment of choice in that area This could be a condition called folliculitis due to friction and sweating It may help to use a cleanser with salicylic acid and a topical antibiotic afterwards such as clindamycin gel this is a prescription product The only reason to avoid Body pain is to take proper and regular exercise Dont forget to maintain Diet Chat Im sorry your wife is dealing with  Its not a fun problem to have thats for sure You may have seen advertisements or information about various diets that purport to help cure or prevent skin conditions such as eczema or psoriasis Unfortunately no causal dietary link to these skin conditions has been proven That means its unlikely your wife can improve her outbreaks by changing what she eats Its possible you have read about the  which is under investigation by several researchers Some evidence shows that infants with eczema go on to develop food allergies However this does not mean that food allergies cause eczema The links between foods and skin conditions are still being investigated Your wife may seek medical treatment for her eczema Topical prescription creams often help clear up outbreaks Home remedies for eczema include taking cool showers instead of hot ones and applying moisturizer generously There may be some link between stress and eczema outbreaks so encourage your wife to indulge in activities that help her relax  such as getting a massage Wishing you well Yes it definitely can refers to narrowing of the spinal canal The spinal canal is a narrow opening within the vertebrae bones of the spine that allow the spinal cord to pass through When the spinal canal becomes narrow it puts pressure on the roots of the nerves that run from the spinal cord to various body parts In the lumbar spine which is located in the lower back the nerves transmit sensation from the legs to the brain If a nerve in the lumbar spine is pinched it can cause the legs or a single leg to transmit pain signals If youve been diagnosed with lumbar spinal stenosis your doctor should be able to treat your pain in the short term and suggest some ways to deal with the problem in the long term I suggest you consult your doctor to find out what your options are I hope you feel better soon Usually when we talk about a blood clot in the leg were referring to a DVT This is a blood clot deep in the leg usually but not always in the calf muscle that can cause complications such as a pulmonary embolism or stroke Part of the reason why a DVT is scary is because we cant see it Only after it begins causing problems do we notice its presence a red swollen lower leg What youre describing sounds more like a  These veins lie close to the surface of the skin and are easily visible Varicose veins have a ropey appearance and can be painful and cause swelling of the leg or foot Interestingly on rare occasion a varicose vein can actually be a sign of a DVT For this reason and because the vein is causing you discomfort it would be a good idea to have this checked out by your primary care provider Best wishes to you Im sorry to hear you feel youre being ignored by the medical professionals who are treating you Thats not good Sometimes a person has to be very vocal in telling their health care provider what they want done  and why If you feel your complaints of chronic back pain have been ignored perhaps this would be a good time for you to tell your doctor straight out that you want some testing done on your back to figure out what is causing the pain It can be helpful to take a trusted family member or friend with you on these appointments This person can act as an advocate or a person who will take up your cause with you Your advocate should have a pen and some paper to take notes and he or she should feel free to ask questions I hope this approach will get you the results you want Unfortunately its impossible to say what this might be without a physical exam Id say the most likely possibility is an  But only a medical professional conducting a physical exam can say for sure Less likely explanations are a sexually transmitted disease like and cancer Its also possible this is a cyst noncancerous or lipoma also noncancerous Id suggest you call your primary health care provider and have this looked at Take care Im very sorry youre going through this Unbearable pain needs to be addressed because it affects a persons entire life If youve been taking the medication for a couple of weeks or more and still have this excruciating pain then its time to revisit the doctor to let him or her know the medication isnt helping Of the medications you listed only the Lyrica generic name pregabalin is prescribed for pain If it is not helping you should talk with your doctor about what other options are available for treatment I hope you get relief soon Im sorry to hear youre going through this Youre obviously anxious to get a diagnosis and I dont blame you That said theres not much value in speculating about what may be causing your symptoms Your doctor is ordering appropriate tests and you have a complicated case due to your other conditions I know its hard to wait not to mention scary but waiting is your best bet Trust your doctor Hang in there I hope you get answers soon It means you should go see your primary care doctor to find out whats going on here Since youve been off the amitriptyline for three weeks the medication should be totally out of your system That means your symptoms must be due to something else You need a physical examination and possibly some lab work to figure this out Its not surprising the vaginal pain returned after you stopped the amitriptyline since vulvodynia is a chronic condition Hopefully youll find something else that works to treat it without side effects Wishing you well Im not trying to alarm you but you need to seek immediate medical attention Although you have a family history of COPD the symptoms you describe point to something else  a heart issue The GOOD NEWS is most heart issues can be wellmanaged over the long term with early diagnosis and treatment I urge you to have a friend drive you to the emergency room You need to get yourself into the hands of medical professionals Wishing you well Im sorry to hear youre in pain Thats never fun Id suggest you visit a health care provider to have this checked out You dont indicate if youre male or female but the symptoms you describe can be caused by an inguinal  Of course several other conditions could also cause these symptoms Getting a physical examination will help determine what has caused this burning sensation After your health care provider diagnoses the problem he or she can give you some treatment options I wish you the best and hope the pain clears up soon Im sorry youre going through this but I doubt it has anything to do with your blood transfusions Just to be clear eczema is not something that can be transmitted through an exchange of blood Eczema is not contagious So you can rule out that theory I suggest you seek a medical opinion about the cause of the scaly itchy skin on your leg It could indeed be eczema But it might be something else altogether A medical professional can not only diagnose the problem but also prescribe an appropriate treatment Wishing you well Dehydration probably wont cause this symptom but many other conditions can Usually the cause of the hands andor feet and legs turning blue isnt serious  unless there are other symptoms involved such as shortness of breath or a fever Depending on a persons skin color the extremities sometimes can look quite blue This is true of very fairskinned people Id suggest your daughter get checked out for this There are a few disorders that can cause this blueness of the extremities Sometimes these disorders actually point to other conditions that can be treated or should be watched as your daughter ages I wish you both all the best Usually this type of sensation is caused by a nerve malfunction  either compression of the nerve root at the spine or some other localized nerve irritation If youre having this sensation frequently its worth getting checked out by a medical professional With a physical exam and perhaps some additional testing like an MRI your health care provider can determine if this sensation is caused by something like in your lower spine A condition like that may need to be monitored as it will only get worse over time I should note also that other conditions could cause the type of sensation youre describing which is why it would be a good idea to have this evaluated if its happening frequently If this sensation only occurs occasionally you probably dont need to be concerned Minor nerve irritation causing symptoms happens to all of us from time to time I hope this helps Im sorry to hear youre going through this How unpleasant Id recommend you have this situation checked out by a doctor If youre scratching something is causing you to itch And you need to find out what is causing the itching It could be something simple like a fungal infection   But then again it could be some type of  While youre waiting for your appointment with a health care provider its very important you Do not have sex even with a condom Do not scratch the affected areas Wash your hands frequently To ease the itching feeling you probably are safe to wash the affected areas gently with warm soapy water and thoroughly dry them You may find it helpful to soak in a tub of warm water with an oatmeal bath Assuming youre not allergic to any medications you might try using a bland powder cornstarch or talc to keep the area dry until you can get a diagnosis from the doctor I wish you all the best Good question Lets just clarify that blood pooling in the leg isnt the same thing as a  Many people have problems with lower leg circulation which often is called  However PVD may put a person at higher risk of developing a DVT As to your question yes an injury to the leg definitely can cause problems with circulation A broken hip or leg or any type of injury that disrupts normal blood flow to the extremity can cause the type of fluid retention and pooling you describe If you did not have your injury treated by a medical professional now would be a good time to have this checked out Your health care provider can assess the situation and get you appropriate treatment Your provider may also be able to further clarify whether the leg injury contributed to the circulation problems I hope this helps Good for you for noticing this Its important for people with chronic conditions like diabetes to stay on top of any physical changes in their body I suggest you call your primary care provider for an appointment The kind of swelling you describe sounds like fluid retention or   This can be a sign of an underlying medical condition possibly related to your diabetes or something else entirely Mild onesided edema of the lower leg isnt necessarily cause for alarm in an otherwise healthy person But it would be best to get it checked out Wishing you well Im sorry to hear youre going through this Dry flaky skin can be more than a nuisance If the skin develops microscopic cracks it can let infections pass through If you have flaky skin all over your body as you stated then one cause could be dehydration As we age we tend to decrease our fluid intake Id suggest you make sure to drink several glasses of plain water each day If you are being treated for high blood pressure or a heart condition you might want to check with your health care provider about how much fluid intake is best for you But generally speaking drinking a few glasses of water per day is safe If you bathe daily Id suggest you cut back on that Were hyperhygienic here in the US Unless youre strenuously exercising you probably dont need a full bath or shower each day and that much bathing can dry out your skin Instead try a daily sponge bath with warm soapy water to clean your armpits groinrectum and under your breasts Rinse and dry thoroughly Your use of lotion is a great idea Keep that up Use a bland moisturizer meaning something with little perfume You can get specific recommendations from a pharmacist or clerk at the local drugstore Thicker is better so look for something that comes in a jar Try not to scratch because this can lead to tears in the skin that allow bacteria in I know its hard maybe impossible not to scratch when your skins that dry But try to avoid it I hope you feel better soon You should get medical attention for your brother as soon as possible These symptoms could relate to a variety of ailments and only a health care professional doing a physical examination can give you a diagnosis Any time a persons symptoms get worse or change suddenly its worth a trip to the doctors office In your brothers case this is especially true because his symptoms are causing him to be unable to walk I dont want to alarm you but I urge you to seek medical attention for your brother as soon as possible Best wishes to you both What youre

Gait refers to the way you walk how your weight is distributed on your legsfeet the length of your stride and so on A change in your gait could certainly contribute to the symptoms you describe The most common cause of heel pain is a condition called pronounced planter fahsheEYEtiss Plantar fasciitis is an annoyance but not a serious disease Your health care provider can tell you whether or not you have plantar fasciitis or some other problem with your foot He or she also should be able to tell you if this is related to your back surgery Id suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider to start with Good luck to you Your symptoms definitely warrant a visit to the doctor You might consider seeing either the orthopedic surgeon who performed your knee replacement or your primary care provider Things can and do go wrong with joint replacements of all types Pieces can break or its possible for them to become infected If you experience a fever redness and heat at the joint and continuing pain Id suggest you seek immediate medical attention Hopefully it will turn out that the pain in your knee is due to a muscle strain or overuse Only a health care provider can diagnose this so you might consider making an appointment soon Best wishes to you Im sorry to hear youre going through this Unfortunately its impossible to say what could be causing this without a physical examination I suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider as soon as possible because the earlier this problem is diagnosed the better the outlook for treating it effectively Youre doing a wonderful service in caring for a disabled child I salute you and hope you get a diagnosis soon Hm Well thats an interesting question Im sorry youre having this problem when youve just begun an activity that should be for your health not viceversa Id recommend you get this checked out by a physician Many things could be causing the symptoms you describe Only a physical examination can begin to solve the mystery Best wishes on your fitness routine and I hope your leg problem gets resolved soon Im sorry to hear your husband is going through this It sounds very distressing for both of you Despite the negative test results Id urge you not to give up Some conditions evolve over time and may take repeated testing to identify Id suggest you make a followup appointment with your husbands primary health care provider to discuss these symptoms and how theyve progressed  or swelling of the legs and arms often is occurs when the veins arent working properly to return blood to the heart Blood pools in the veins and some of the fluid component of the blood seeps into the surrounding tissue causing swelling Very often excessive salt intake contributes to edema Your husband might consider reducing his salt intake Read food labels carefully youll be surprised how much sodium is lurking in there Smoking cigarettes also can contribute to poor circulation especially in the legs If your husband smokes Id suggest he seek medical help to quit Hope this helps Im sorry to hear youre going through this but Im glad youve already taken steps to get a diagnosis If youre experiencing a lot of pain you might consider putting in a call to your providers office to ask about getting some pain medicine prescribed to you You dont have to wait until your next visit for that Its good news that the lump isnt lifethreatening Many of the lumps and bumps that occur in the soft tissue of our bodies are simply or noncancerous If you have a cyst it could be red swollen and painful It also could ooze I am not trying to diagnose your problem here just providing information With luck your doctor will be able to drain or remove the lump and then the pain will go away Hope this helps Probably not The area youre describing the back of the thigh consists of a trio of muscles we call the  What youre describing sounds like a common spasm or cramp of the hamstring This can happen for various reasons  or no reason at all The hamstring would be an uncommon place for a to arise particularly in the absence of any other contributing factors such as recent joint replacement surgery Muscle cramps in general can signal dehydration or even a mild potassium deficiency so you could try drinking more water or eating a banana assuming your not allergic to see if that helps the situation If the cramping doesnt clear up on its own you certainly can put a call in to your primary health care provider for an appointment to have this evaluated Hope this helps Because you already have been diagnosed with  Id suggest you contact your primary health care provider to inform him or her of this new symptom And in answer to your question yes this is a new symptom It may be related to the MS or it may be caused by something else Only your health care provider can tell you for sure Wishing you all the best What youre experiencing sounds awful I hope you get some relief soon I strongly suggest you see a health care provider to evaluate these symptoms Sometimes things like leg pains in children dont need to be treated but youre an adult now and still have the pain That definitely deserves to be looked at The may or may not be related to the leg pain Anyone can develop migraines Many people believe they have migraines when they actually have common headaches Migraines are a very specific type of headache that requires special treatment Only a health care provider can tell you if you are getting true migraines or not Again I urge you to see a health care provider about this And I wish you all the best Thats a good question A is what we call the death of small portions of brain tissue due to an interruption of oxygen delivery Common causes of stroke include a blood clot which prevents the flow of oxygenrich blood to an area of the brain or a hemorrhage basically a burst blood vessel in the brain Usually the symptoms of stroke such as weakness only affect one side of the body not both So if your question is can stroke cause weakness in both legs and nothing else then the answer is probably not because a stroke doesnt usually affect both sides of the body at the same time If your question is can stroke cause weakness is one leg and no other body parts on that side the answer again is probably not Usually a stroke causes weakness to the entire side of the body from the face to the toes Everyone should know the because stroke is an emergency that requires prompt treatment If you ever suspect someone is having a stroke do these three things If the person youre testing for stroke does not pass two of the above tests call 911 immediately When it comes to stroke better safe than sorry Hope this helps I guess the safest advice to give you is to call your surgeons office for some guidance On the one hand the bruiselike mark on your lower abdomen doesnt surprise me after a  But the warmness in your legs sounds a bit unusual In a laparoscopy procedure three small incisions are made in the abdomen One of these cuts is in the belly button Because gravity will pull old blood such as in a bruise toward the feet that mark you see on your belly could simply be bruising related to the belly button incision Why your legs would feel warm is a mystery to me When you speak to your surgeon or his or her nurse be prepared to tell him or her when the symptoms started This will help them assess if the leg issue is related to the surgery or not Wishing you all the best To answer your primary question in the back do not lead to cancer Theres no relationship I know of between disc disease and any type of cancer So at least you can set your mind at ease about that Im sorry youre having pain though You deserve to have your pain treated Please make an appointment with your primary care provider to discuss your pain and hopefully leave with a treatment plan If your primary care provider doesnt prefer to treat chronic pain he or she may refer you a pain specialist Physical therapy also might be helpful I wish you all the best with this Im sorry youre going through this I cant offer personal experience but I have a few thoughts for you All patients who undergo require physical therapy afterwards to rehabilitate the joint If you have a prosthesis for your right leg this rehabilitation will be easier If you dont have a prosthesis this might be a good time to consider one But even if you have no prosthesis your physical therapy team should be able to design a program that meets your needs Having an amputated leg shouldnt complicate your recovery too much Hip replacement surgery today isnt as grueling as it was 20 years ago Techniques have improved and the surgery today has a much shorter recovery period Id suggest you have a good talk with your surgeon about the potential pitfalls of recovery from total hip replacement after amputation of the opposite leg If your surgeon doesnt have experience with this situation Id suggest you find one who does Good luck to you If you have  its important to seek immediate medical attention Onesided weakness can be a sign of stroke Here are other common symptoms Sudden vision changes Sudden problems walking Sudden severe headache Sudden inability to speak Most of the time the symptoms of stroke come on suddenly but this is not always the case If your onesided weakness has developed gradually and seems to be getting worse you should see a doctor I cant think of any reason why anxiety would cause onesided weakness I suppose its possible it could be a medication sideeffect but this still deserves to be checked out I suggest you call your doctor as soon as possible Best wishes to you Well to be honest with you this sounds like  Edema is a fancy word for swelling In this case edema would refer to fluid retention in the legs If this is a new symptom its worth getting it checked out by your primary care provider Many conditions can cause edema of the legs and several of them are treatable Meanwhile you can relieve this swelling by elevating your legs or wearing compression stockings available over the counter for both women and men If possible you might also reduce your salt intake as this can lead to swelling of the legs Hope this helps Hm Im sorry to hear youre going through this Im going to assume you got a skin graft to cover the large burned area If this is the case remember you need to keep it wellmoisturized because it will not produce its own protective oils the way the rest of your skin does If youre not putting plenty of lotion or oil on the graft it could possibly respond in the way youre describing Regardless of whether or not you got a graft the fact youre having new symptoms in this old burn scar is worth a trip to the doctor Id suggest you make an appointment with either the health care provider who handled your burn at the time or with your primary care provider to have this looked at Meanwhile if youre not allergic to any medications youre probably OK to take some Benadryl diphenhydramine to calm the itching especially at night Diphenhydramine may make you very drowsy so use caution if taking it during the day I wish you all the best with this Im sorry youve had a bad experience with the emergency department Usually dont require emergency treatment so there was no harm in your trying to treat this at home However the fact youre now experiencing scrotal swelling of the scrotum tells me the problem has escalated and you should seek medical attention If you have red streaks on the skin around the area of the boil or if youre running a fever you should see a doctor as soon as possible If youre not feverish you could try calling your primary care provider to get an appointment soon Be sure to let them know whats going on so they can advise you if its OK to wait Hope you get this cleared up soon Im sorry to hear you and your loved one are going through this Its hard to help when a person cant communicate Id suggest you have your loved one checked out by a doctor Whenever an elderly person exhibits odd symptoms the first thing that comes to mind is a  While these often cause delirium in a patient as opposed to the physical actions youre describing it might be a good idea to rule out a UTI At the same time a health care provider may be able to shed some light on why your loved one is exhibiting these symptoms Perhaps shes having pain she cant communicate Its hard to tell without a physical exam and a knowledge of her medical history I wish you both all the best Im sorry youre going through this I can certainly understand your wanting a more permanent solution to the problem after dealing with the support hose for five years Certainly there are to treat  Im not sure why your health care provider didnt recommend any of them when you were first diagnosed After five years you may feel free to return to your provider and ask about more permanent options for your condition There may be a very good reason why you werent offered surgery to begin with Maybe it wasnt feasible for some reason But surgical techniques change and patients change Maybe today youre a better candidate for surgery than you were five years ago The only way to find out is to see a medical professional You can start with your primary care provider or go directly to a physician who specializes in varicose vein treatments Hope this helps A fall like the one you describe definitely can cause muscle stiffness and soreness throughout the entire body In fact a fall like that can cause painful back spasms in particular You should see a doctor if Symptoms get worse after 3 days or so You begin to have difficulty breathing or shortness of breath You begin to run a fever You experience numbness shocklike pains or a running water sensation in your arms or hands You have difficulty urinating Otherwise you probably are safe to take a waitandsee approach to this Muscle spasms and soreness may resolve on their own or they may require medical intervention Only time will tell Feel better soon Im sorry to hear this elderly lady is going through this She otherwise sounds like shes in very good shape I suggest you start with a trip to her primary care provider Thats usually the best starting point because the PCP has all of this ladys health history and can get her on the path to see the correct specialist if necessary Of course its impossible to say whats causing this leg swelling without doing a physical examination If I had to guess Id say its probably some sort of venous stasis problem This could also be the reason for the small ulcer on her leg Venous stasis problems in which blood pools in the legs is very common in older adults Its important to get this lady in to see her PCP as soon as possible Those little leg ulcers can blow up into ugly sores rather quickly so it would be wise to have it looked at Hope this helps Im sorry youre experiencing this It sounds very unpleasant Id suggest you get checked out by a health care provider as soon as you can The symptoms you describe can be caused by a variety of conditions some of them more serious than others Im not suggesting youre experiencing an emergency but Id recommend you get this checked out sooner rather than later If your calf or thigh hurts to touch and is hot red or swollen this could be the sign of a  and you should seek immediate medical attention Feel better Great question Im glad it sounds like you came out of this with just a bad bruise The warmth probably is simply a part of the bodys natural healing process Whenever the body sustains an injury to the tissue it sends an army of cells to the area to repair the injury This cellular activity can cause the area to feel warm If this is whats going on the warmth should go away within a few days If the warmness persists it might be worth having your leg checked out by a doctor just to make sure you didnt bruise the bone and dont have an infection brewing in there In any case if you start to run a fever then its time to see a doctor Otherwise try to keep the leg propped up and maybe put a little ice on the area Use a towel between the ice pack and your skin Leave the ice on for 20 minutes then off for at least 20 minutes Hope this helps I applaud you for wanting to exercise more Thats almost always a good thing I suggest you consult your health care provider about your leg issues Many conditions can cause the symptoms youre describing and if its something benign like simple of the legs then walking despite the pain could well fix the problem But your best bet is to see a medical professional for a diagnosis and to get cleared for exercise I hope youre on your way to better health and painfree living soon This is strange indeed The problem with skin rashes is there are so many things that can cause them Since the rash doesnt itch and presumably doesnt cause any pain its hard to tell what may be causing it Since this started about 3 months ago I would ask if you or your father by any chance changed laundry detergents dryer sheets soap or anything like that Perhaps the cause is environmental since the rash seems to occur in places where clothing touches the skin The only way to tell for sure whats going on is to see a health care provider Your dad can start with his primary care provider who will refer him to a dermatologist if necessary In the meantime it would be helpful to the health care provider if you could get some good photos of the rash both closeup and from far away Because the rash only occurs in the evening your dad may not be exhibiting the rash when he sees his provider Best wishes to you and your dad Im sorry youre going through this Sleep problems are very difficult to cope with It sounds like youve been trying all the right things and youre taking medications that should make it easier to sleep  but obviously are not Id suggest you try some nonmedicinal techniques to help you get some sleep Good sleep hygiene or a collection of practices you use regularly to maintain the sleepwake cycle can make a world of difference Avoid napping during the day Exercise regularly if you are able and have been cleared by a physician to do so even simply taking a walk each day is helpful Avoid eating a large meal close to bedtime Keep your bed for sleep only dont lie around in it and watch TV or read during the day Maintain a relaxing bedtime routine such as taking a warm bath before bed then spending a few minutes reading before you turn out the light Create a relaxing bedroom environment with low light and a comfortable temperature If these things dont help and your sleeplessness continues you may want to visit with your health care provider about other ways to solve this problem Good luck to you Im sorry to hear youre going through this Well it could be a rash Or it could be a circulation problem Only a physical examination by a health care provider can say for sure whats going on Id advise you to get this checked out sooner rather than later If its a rash your health care provider can recommend a treatment If its a sign of a larger problem your healthcare provider can get a jump on treating it which means a better outcome for you Theres simply no downside to getting a doctor to look at this Hope this helps Im sorry to hear youre going through this Few things are as painful as leg cramps Two common causes of lower leg cramps are dehydration and low potassium levels in the blood So your first potential solution is to simply drink more water If you have high blood pressure you should consult your physician before you substantially increase your water intake but in general drinking a few extra glasses of water a day isnt going to hurt you If you have high blood pressure and take a water pill diuretic you should find out if it is a potassiumsparing type of not If your diuretic is not potassiumsparing you should be taking a prescription potassium pill Again if youre uncertain about these things you should consult your doctor I dont recommend people run out and start taking potassium supplements which you can buy over the counter to cure leg cramps Potassium is a key mineral for heart function and overdosing on potassium can cause serious heart rhythm abnormalities However eating potassiumrich foods like sweet potatoes tomato sauce and whole beans like navy beans or pinto beans not only will increase your serum blood potassium levels to possibly help the leg cramps but they will be dietfriendly for your diabetes Everything Ive told you here is based on the assumption you dont have a lot of other health issues besides the diabetes going on and that you dont take a lot of medications Many medications and coexisting medical conditions can cause lower leg cramps So its always a good idea to let your medical professional know whats going on Wishing you well No Ive never had that problem I havent fallen and hurt my legs at time in the last few months Im not a diabetic I have had my legs cramp up on me once in a great while It doesnt happen very often Really I rarely have any leg cramps But when I do get them they hurt  I am a stage 4 with ckd hi Consult a doctor If the skin has not been scraped or cut it could possibly be cellulitus caused by swelling of the legs or several other conditions all of which require a doctors care It could be a very serious condition so please make an appointment  Leg cramps are mostly caused by dehydration low magnesium or low blood calcium The best treatment for cramps is to rehydrate and replenish your electrolytes possibly with chicken or beef broth Low potassium is usually a sign of muscle weakness Leg cramps are mostly caused by dehydration low magnesium or low blood calcium The best treatment for cramps is to rehydrate and replenish your electrolytes possibly with chicken or beef broth Dont use quinine for your husbands leg cramps Quinine is a malaria drug that can cause serious side effects such as severe bleeding abnormal heart rhythms and even death The FDA issued a drug safety warning on July 8 2010 and will soon require the drugmaker to warn doctors of its potentially lifethreatening side effects Talk to the doctor about other safe ways to ease leg cramps Have you been tested for Mono Did the pain start suddenly Did you lift something up and the pain started It could be sciatica Need to go see a Doctor can get anywhere I worked at hospital as a Patient Advocate for 13yrs and spent a lot of time in the ERs witnessing the Ortho surgeons frustration from their patients delay in getting xrays and proper treatment all because of that old adage If you can move it it isnt broken That is only partially true Keep looking bed bugs are surprisingly hard to find at first That and considering they can hibernate for up to one year without a food source is what makes them one of the hardest most durable pests to remove from your home It is possible It sounds as if you and your Mom are very close and you are very much in tune to her pain and therefore when she has her period you are having symptoms and pain similiar to hers Its the same as a husband that loves his wife so very much and often when she is pregnant he will have sympathy pain and experience some of what she is going through Start taking low dose asprin daily If you know you already have them you may want to take 2 If the clots go to ur heart or brain without breaking down it can be fatal Sounds almost the same as what happened to me I found out that it was an abscess You should seek medical attention because it could spread and cause a severe infection Well there is an example of burning of the skin after you fall on a hard concrete surface scrapes and cuts are some of the causes of skin burn But there are some things that you can do to kill the bacteria that can make you sick You can use rubbing alcohol or peroxide liquid peroxide is better because the acid level that can fight off invading germs can actually heel the scrape or cut IF you have a fairly regular 28 day cycle a period due on 25th of May would indicate ovulation was expected to be around 11th of May The 4th of May is 7 days before that but sperm only live about 4 days at most 5 days while swimming around searching for the egg What was the CT of her whole body or just the leg Does the numbness occur when she is sitting with her legs crossed laying down on that side or spontaneously Is it long lasting or short lasting It could have been caused by dehydration from being in the sun I used to get extremely bad cramps in my leg and it hurt so bad I was holding my breath when it happened I went to the doctor and they found that I had low potassium which can cause muscle cramps however blood clots in the leg can also cause extreme pain Might be a good idea to visit your doctor and get it sorted Dont know if you go to the tanning bed but I went through that It was caused from an ingredient in the tanning lotion It didnt hurt or itch but benedryl done the trick Sounds like you got the Epstein Bar Virus or Mono I have had both and am getting it again well rather that or Lymphoma but as for the bite might not have anything to do with it but you might want to set it checked out along with a Mononucleosis test or Epstein Bar Virus test just to make sure and they can take up to a week for the results and Mono does not have a cure or treatment you have to get lots of rest and get some over the counter pain pills the reason I know is because I have had Mono Summer 2012 and I am getting it again well rather that or Lymphoma If the pain is sharp and placed about a quarter of the way down the hip and to the back side of hip it could possibly be sciatic nerve issue A good Chiropractor can help I work with prostate cancer patients Muscle pain is not associated with the prostate cancer primarily it is more bone pain when the cancer has metastasized Muscle fatigue is a symptom with certain treatments of prostate cancer Elizabeth at this point I would suggest you speak to your family doctor if you have one to be referred to an orthopedic doctor or an orthopedic surgeon They would be the best person to evaluate and deal with your condition When you are at the point where you are popping the joint out of place or your nerve is pinched When we get injuries to our hips we tend to limpchange the way we walk That can throw the body off balance causing backknee or ankle pain So speak to your doctor soon Good luck to you I hope you get relief to your problem I have excema or dermatitis like that see your doctor for a hydracortisone cream that should help I would monitor the rash and if it appears to be getting worse  warm to touch swollen or spreading  you will need to go to the doctor for evaluation Since you are sensitive to these types of bites have you considered applying a topical product before you go out to avoid bites There are a variety of different products on the market in various forms There are even some sunscreens that now contain repellents Based on the fact that you are having so much pain and that you dont want to walk I would advise seeing a doctor or health care provider immediately This type of bite can lead to a serious skin infection so you want to have it checked out especially due to the pain It can be a warning sign of some type of infection Im sorry for your pain That severe muscle spasm in your lower back is what is most likely causing your pain I would get it check out by an Orthopedic since it may be a lower back as in bones not muscles probIem physical therapy Your moms swollen legs and blisters on her toes are concerning Im assuming your mom has diabetes since you said she has high sugar levels People with diabetes are prone to getting serious foot infections and it would be good for a healthcare professional to examine her feet Also there are several conditions that can cause swelling in the legs It would be helpful for your doctor to check to see if her swelling could be related to a heart problem or kidney problem High blood sugars like you are describing are concerning You may want to speak with your doctor about referring you to see an endocrinologist who specializes in diabetes In some cases the hemoglobin A1C test can give false results This sometimes occurs in people with certain conditions like thalassemia or sickle cell anemia People with these conditions can have a type of hemoglobin that is less common and can affect the results of some A1C tests There are also other medical conditions that can affect A1C test results Here is a link to an article that discusses in detail the AIC test httpdiabetesniddknihgovdmpubsA1CTest Take care Hi I would speak to my dr about the side effect of RLS and anti depressants It could be possible Try a daily dose of folic acid for your RLS that does work Also see if you can get your hubby to massage your legs and feet before bed time Hope this helps Maybe you should go see a doctor and get tested for diabetes the same happened to my sister just with her hands as well Have you been tested for fibromyalgia I have this and the pain moves to different areas  Get to a doctor about your stomach pain and get that checked out as soon as possible The other symptoms exept maybe the itchy groin area can be attributed to Diabetes but again this needs to be verified by further examination by a doctor I hope you feel better but again please see a doctor about the pain as soon as possible and get a full blood workup which can provide insight on can be causing your other issues You could have a Meniscus TearInflammation This happened to me a while back My treatment was cortisone shots every couple of weeks until the inflammation died down If it is very painful and chronic you can get an operation to fix it this is assuming that is the issue Hi No Applying steroid creams to your skin should not cause you to gain weight One of the reasons topically applied steroids are favored over those taken systemically is that you can avoid most of the unwanted side effects of steroid use There are many things that can cause swelling below the knee known as edema It is usually a result of fluid retention and can be caused by several different health conditions Cyclosporine has been

PD usually is associated with stiffness and slowness of the limbs and this may feel like weakness If you have a tremor especially if it is in the leg I would be more likely to think about PD as a cause Other things to consider Pain can lead to favoring the other leg  and a sense of weakness A muscle or nerve problem in that leg A back injury causing pain in the leg or pinching of a nerve to the leg A stroke  but this is not likely given that it is quite sudden in onset and you would have gone to the hospital not WebMD Please consider an appt with a neurologist This is DEFINATELY

office so they can assure you that you are fine which worked for me I am not a doctor but wanted to respond to the nutritional aspects Some of the symptoms you list such as frequent urination are symtpoms of type 1 diabetes Im not saying you have it but it is worth being checked out As for the dizzy feelings after sugar its hard to say I would aim to eat balanced meals with a protein healthy fat whole grains and fruits and vegetables If you eat sugar do so after a balanced meal or snack Eating sugary foods on an empty stomach may contribute to the dizzy feelings The best possible thing to do is get a physical that includes lab work to make sure everything is okay In the meantime focus on taking care of yourself by eating well and getting sleep I have the same problem Dont really remember hurting my leg but have had an indentation on it for a couple of years and seems to be getting deeper It is bruised and is always feels hotter than the rest of my leg It normally donst hurt but lately when I walk sometimes I can feel the pull on my shin with slight pain DVT or deep venous thrombosis is a blood clot that forms in the deep veins often in the thigh or calf Risk factors for DVT fall into two categories inherited and acquired Inherited risks include different conditions that cause the blood to clot more easily The more common of these are mutations of factor V Leiden and the prothrombin gene These may run in families Some of the acquired risks include \tRecent surgery \tObesity \tExtended travel or bed rest \tCancer \tPregnancy \tHormone therapy and birth control pills You report that you have at least two of these risk factors for blood clotsyour weight and your family history Blood clots in the leg do not always have any symptoms at all Symptoms when they occur may include any of the following \tSwelling \tPain or tendernesspossibly only while standing or walking \tWarmth in the skin \tRed or discolored skin \tLeg fatigue Because of your risk factors and symptoms you should call your doctor right away DVT is dangerous because a blood clot can travel from the leg and become lodged in the lungs This can cause serious breathing problems and even death Your doctor may recommend a blood test called a ddimer an ultrasound or an xray test called a venogram to help diagnose the problem Click here for more information on the Symptoms and Diagnosis of Deep Vein Thrombosis There can be many causes for a neuropathy Your doctor has most likely already taken a good medical history and a physical exam Many clues can be obtained with these simple tools Examination of the legs and feet will include checking your reflexes strength and sensation Depending on the results you may need an EMG test and lab work Sometimes xrays CT scans or MRIs may be needed of your back or brain Some of the possible causes of neuropathy besides diabetes include vitamin B12 deficiency thyroid problems autoimmune diseases Lyme disease inflamed blood vessels kidney failure alcohol abuse HIV infection and syphilis Multiple sclerosis GuillainBarr syndrome and rare types of cancers may also cause neuropathy The next step if your doctor cant find a cause for your problem would be to see a neurologist This is a doctor who specializes in diseases of the brain and nerves Make sure to take all your test results with you I hope you get some answers and relief soon It is very hard when a loved one is no longer able to communicate her needs to her caregiver In this case you need to be sure that she is safe and not in any pain or discomfort A checkup with her doctor is the first step The doctor will need to know how long she has been upset at night and if there have been any changes to her care or surroundings that could help explain her behavior Persons who have dementia are often more confused and frightened at night or in unfamiliar surroundings After a thorough exam the doctor will be able to discuss a care plan that can help both of you This constant care and lack of sleep can put a lot of strain on the caregivers Your local Area Council on Aging or State Department of Aging can provide resources to help you cope WebMD also has a slide show that may help called 14 Ways to Prevent Caregiver Burnout httpwwwwebmdcomhealthyagingssslideshowavoidcaregiverburnout It all depends on what part of the hip replacement fails There are times when a revision hip replacement just entails a change out of the liner in the hip socket portion of the replacement This is generally a pretty easy operation to recover from There are also times when the femoral component thigh bone implant andor the acetabular component metal part of the hip socket implant fail These are bigger operations and are associated with a longer period of recovery There is not doubt that surgeons now have much better implants to use in these redo situations It is hopeful that the options for these redo procedures continue to improve as we go forward It is most important to make sure you keep an appropriate followup schedule with your surgeon so that early signs of failure are not missed Some people will report a tingling sensation in their legs a creepy crawly sensation Oftentimes that can be something called restless leg syndrome That can also be due to by the way iron poor blood and so people need to be careful to make sure that they are not anemic but that is definitely a situation that youd want to talk with your physician about because there are both medications and behavioral treatments that can be helpful for that if Im not anemic what causes restless leg syndrome Nobodys 100 sure exactly what causes it but what we think is that theres a lack of dopamine in the bloodstream because the medications that are currently being used are what are called dopamine agonists or they increase the amount of dopamine in the blood thereby allowing this tingling sensation to reduce There are many possible causes of kidney pain Your doctor would need to examine you to figure out whats going on The description of your symptoms does not point to any obvious cause of your pain so call your doctor and get checked I am not a vet but I do have 3 dogs and 3 cats so I have a lot of personal experience with pets I would be concerned about the dog dragging his back legs That is not something that would generally be caused by the routine causes of diarrhea I am pretty confident any veterinarian would suggest the dog needs to be seen probably sooner than later That is not something that over the counter meds would be able to treat INFECTION See a doctor or emergency room IMMEDIATELY I had a friend who had his knee replaced and it took approx 69 months before pain went away completely Remember you have a foreign object in your body The body needs time to adjust Have her blood tested for leukemia God bless This sometimes happens to people who are on blood thinners such as Coumadin This could be caused by several different things one being something going on with your back eg bulging or herniated disc One symptom might be numbness in your feet  I respectfully disagree with the previous poster first off an mri would be the easiest way to diagnosis a herniated disc Sometimes if its bad enough it will show up on a ct scan Secondly Xrays are kind of a false sense of security They are only able to tell if you have a fracture In some small instances it can show the spine being pulled due to muscle spasms or as the previous poster said curvature of the spine The only way an Xray can be helpful is if and only if you go back in 6 weeks and get another set done it can show if there were a hairline fracture by new bone growth  Like any broken bone it will grow back together in 6 weeks with extra bone present Going later for the second set of xrays the bone growth can beinterrupted as arthritis because the body will have bone growth after injury in a year to 16 months osteophytes to stabilize the spine Lastly if you havent been diagnosed I would defer going to a chiropractor If you are diagnosed with herniated discs they cant or should not do adjustments on you as they can cause paralysis if they crack the wrong way Be your health advocate I tried the surgery route you trade one pain for another Question continued Hi Sorry but its a very visual thing your best bet would be your doctor if you have one if not try the ER Good Luck

thumb for panic disorder is that your panic attacks occur three times in a 6month period with no apparent trigger Regardless I would encourage you to go see a psychiatrist or other mental health professional You are not alone in having these symptoms anxiety disorders are very common and someone like a psychiatrist would love to see you and help you out Best wishes  Any doctor would first and foremost advise you to rest and take things easy for a while Pinched nerves can be recovered from within a few days or weeks However depending on the severity of the pinched nerve a brace andor surgery would be required Like always go see your doctor and heshe will know whats best Best wishes  I would agree make the appointment to see your doctor ASAP Thats the best thing to do Depends on cause Is it sciatica or neurapathy Is it bone pain or joint pain Buy and mix equal volumes of H2O2 and generic Listerine Splash this and let dry on the affected area after shower Use Neomycen Ointment in the nares at night to treat staph reinfections Sounds like leg cramps Try a 6 oz glass of tonic water before each bedtime Sometimes deep bruises do not heal if there is damage to the tissue If you are concerned its something else you can ask your doctor about it next time you go in for a check up but I wouldnt worry too much about it for now if you are not in pain Sounds like this is either a rash posibly caused by detergents used on your sheets Or it could be burst blood vessels since they will start out as red dots then once the blood dries that would cause them to turn brown You are allergic to fish This very thing happened to me many years ago after eating Orange Roughie Then I noticed I would get nauseated just eating tuna or any other kind of fish Also fish oil supplement for omega 3 caused vomiting Now I avoid fish at all cost For Omega 3 I take Flax Oil capsules Its a bummer but it can be dangerous Do not massage the leg massaging the leg can move the blood clot allowing the potential to move to heart lung or brain I suggest calling the doctor but I would take pain med like Tylenol I dont know what type of medicine shes on do aspirin may interfere with it so Tylenol would be safer the pain is from lack of circulation I want to say warm soak in tub to open up vessels Call the physician and ask No it is by prescription only go see a doctor You could have critters living under the surface of your skin I would go in to have them lanced open cleaned out with sterile solution and get on some antibiotics instantly Talk to your hemotologist and diagestive Doctor about this situation along with your family Doctor Your family Doctor could test you for Diabeties especially if you are sweating heavily at night Your hemotologist would do a blood count test and may request further tests to be performed Your diagestive Doctor would run tests and examine various areas of your diagestive system It is important to talk to all three of your Doctors about this situation do not be scared to ask questions the results could be something minor I myself can not help you but I to have had femur repair and my pain is very excruciating unbearable pain No one has dx this and I read your in the very same condition as I Some doctors just said it will go away I would like to know how youfound the hole in the muscle mri cat scan please help me May God Bless you and I prAY FOR YOUR COMPLETE HEALING DID THEY SAY IT WILL MEND ON ITS OWN tHANK YOU pATRICIA aNN Absolutely Yes if your doctor is willing to say that you cannot work because of it They usually prescribe compression stockings for such a condition Yes I have experienced a move from my right foot to my left It also led to significant numbness in the toes on left foot Gabapentin seems to handle the situation when sleeping Stretch before any extraordinary activities you may also be dehydrated is the pain on the outside of the thigh an feel like a stabbing sensation just below the hip or back side of calf about 14 down from the knee try drinking more water and hydrating your body before intercourse You are probably just experiencing muscle cramps Bananas  potassium seems to help prevent muscle cramps Alcohol can cause them also especially the day after drinking From my experience stand up as soon as you feel the onset of the cramp and message the muscle then drink a glass of water I started getting them when I was mid 20s and found my alcohol and hydration was a huge factor in getting these cramps No No could be bad circulationgo see your family doc It could be due to less circulation of blood and lack of enough oxygen Wearing stockings would improve the blood flow I am 73 years old female and have the exact same symptoms I went to my doctor thinking it might be shingles She said no it was probably some type of allergic reaction maybe caused by anxiety She recommended Claritin which can be purchased over the counter I had neuropathy pain in my left foot but I never took medication for it My A1cs had been 5360 for several years but the pain was still there In 2007 I started using an insulin pump My adjustments on my pump enabled me to be in the range 70130 almost 90 of the time That improvement resulted in greatly reducing my pain I have an occasional twinge of the neuropathy pain but it rarely bothers me now Many diabetics can reverse their neuropathy by improving their control There are many normal aches and pains of pregnancy Many women suffer from restless leg syndrome during the night and have many leg cramps Another problem that women suffer from is sciatica pain This pain is typically noted to start in the buttock and go down the back of the leg This at times can be very uncomfortable This is related compression of the nerve supply from the enlarged uterus The other problem that can occur is related to lumbar disc problems which can be more severe and cause possible significant problems As always you should consult with your physician and make him aware of your concerns Leg cramps can be caused by many different things not just muscle spasms Flexeril would not likely help and may be too sedating to use on a regular basis It would be best to be properly evaluated to find the reason Just eating a few bananas a week is not going to solve this problem if you are not sure of the underlying cause My personal opinion is no I would not recommend acupuncture for the control of edema most likely due to the congestive heart failure and kidney disease however I do not know the details of his medical history or his age Lichen planus Unfortunately it would not be possible for me or any medical provider for that matter to be able to offer you a diagnosis blindly over the Internet Not only do you need to be carefully examined but the doctor will need to take a thorough medical history and order some diagnostic lab tests It would not be possible or prudent to guess what may be causing pain all over your body so you will need to see a medical professional to start the diagnostic process Ask the podiatrist No one can really address this question than the medical professional that made this decision I agree that a full leg air cast is a bit excessive so he will need to offer you a reasonable explanation It would not be prudent or even possible to determine if someone was experiencing a stroke blindly over the Internet Strokes are unilateral one sided and severe daily foot or leg cramping are not signs one would experience These symptoms could indicate vascular problems or even neurological disorders however so they deserve a complete evaluation by your medical provider Expect some diagnostic tests including blood tests  and perhaps a low back xray or Doppler imaging studies of your lower extremities if your medical provider feels these tests are necessary Never underestimate the wisdom of your bodies to give us warning signs so please do not ignore these symptoms As much as I would like to address your concern my worried friend there is absolutely NO WAY for me to blindly make any type of determination about this mysterious bump You have seen multiple doctors but unfortunately this medical provider cant see it to offer an opinion If this i on your skin see a dermatologist If it is not onesided as you mentioned it is something else other than shingles but unfortunately without the ability to see it firsthand during an examination I would not be able to narrow down the many possibilities for you based solely on your description You would need to see a medical provider so you can have these skin lesions properly diagnosed Your child cannot be adequately diagnosed without an examination A medical professional will need to see him firsthand a description is just not sufficient to make this important call There are literally hundreds of bumps that can occur on human skin I dont know why your husband it getting leg crampsthere can be dozens of reasons but I can tell you that vitamin B12 doesnt cause them He will need to discuss this issue with his medical provider to determine a causeand a solution Remember that men can be stubborn about getting medical care so your encouragement is very important In variesdepending on the thickness and amount of padding but a fiberglass short leg cast only weighs a few pounds I put them on but I cant say I ever had the urge to weigh them NO it is normal It is time for you to see a back specialist and get a diagnostic workup perhaps including an MRI There can be many possible causes Back pain isnt just for older people I dont knowI have no way of examining you or ordering any diagnostic tests but it could be sciatic nerve compression perhaps due to a bad or degenerative disc You need an MRI and a visit to a back specialist There is really little that I can do blindly over the Internet since I have no way of examining your skin eruption A visual exam is essential to make an accurate diagnosis Failure to improve on your current treatment may indicated that the diagnosis was incorrect or the treatment was not appropriate Your only course of action is to be examined again or see a dermatologist for a higherlevel diagnostic opinion Back exercises and stretching is the best nonsurgical way of dealing with sciatica If you are overweight the extra lbs need to go You can find lots of Internet references for the proper exercises called Williams back exercises or ask a friendly physical therapist for a list Your description is really not sufficient for me to even make a wild guess I dont know your babys age or the location of these lumps and obviously I have no way of feelingexamining them to give you a definitive answer Any chance that they are related to the vaccine administrations on the upper thigh area Children often bleed a tiny bit under the skin from the injection This area can form a tiny innocent lump that can take a while to selfresolve Without the ability to examine your friend firsthand and make my own decision whether an xray or other imaging studies are needed there is very little that can be done blindly over the Internet A description no matter how extensive is not a substitute for a proper examination As much as I would like to help she will need to see a medical provider if she would like those important answers In the meantime ice compresses elevating the leg and some ibuprofen will help I have no way of seeing this rash over the Internet but my concern would be that the cat scratch has caused a skin infection that may require oral antibiotics Cat scratches are notorious for causing skin infections incidentally When you mess with Mother Nature there is no way to predict outcome  positive or negative ones Rather than mess with your own male hormones by taking potent female hormones I would strongly suggest that you find and consult a medical professional like an endocrinologist who is experienced in sexual reassignment therapy This is NOT something you should be doing on your own Unless I was able to examine the legankle and have an xray as a guide there would be no way to guess at an prognosis or outcome Some minor fractures can be managed in a boot but I would not know if this treatment would be appropriate for this particular patient  all fractures are different As far as I know there are no herbs or vitamins that will control or cure RLS restless leg syndrome You may hear some claims but nothing overthecounter has been scientifcally proven to work There are prescription medications however The causes of psoriasis is really unknown I can vindicate the cats as a cause however Cats can cause allergic responses to the skin but cats do not cause psoriasis Go with her to her next doctors appointment or inform the prescribing medical provider that she is addicted and abusing this dangerous narcotic You are wise and caring for being concerned but only your wife can stop Have her seek help from a selfhelp 12step program If she is truly in pain seeing a pain specialist is the best way to go Her doctor can refer her There is really no way for me or any medical provider to make blind pain medication suggestions since we do not know her particular case She needs help and you can help her get this help Maybe Anything that throws off your normal gait or balance can cause a domino effect See your medical provider to determine a reason for your symptoms Keep in mind that a person can have more than one issue going on at the same timeyour hip pain could be totally unrelated so get it checked out It would be impossible to diagnose you blindly over the Internet without a thorough medical history review of your test results and a handson examination Just because your current medical providers have not been able to find the cause of your symptoms does not mean that another specialist will come to the same conclusion Get a second opinion from another specialist neurologist or neurosurgeon You need to go back and see the orthopedist againthe same one that did your original surgery or a different knee specialist You will likely need an MRI of the knee at some point I dont know enough about your particular case nothing in fact to know if you are a surgical candidate or not I think it is a big jump from failure of antiinflammatory cream to the operating room however A choice of specialists depends on where the nerve impingment starts If it is in your back a neurosurgeon or an orthopedic surgeon would be the specialist of choice Children have very thin skin and are prone to scarring and infection if the burn is not properly assessed and treated It would be best since I have no ability to examine your son and determine the extent and seriousness of the burn blindly over the Internet to see a medical provider  either an urgent care facility or ER Yes something is clearly wrong with your mother and you are very sweet to be concerned Unfortunately it would not be possible to diagnose your mother let along treat her over the Internet in this forum Your mother will need to find another medical provider to exam her  one that does not think that her symptoms are weird Please encourage her to do so There are sooooo many different reasons to account for her symptoms that it would be impossible to blindly solve it with a simple posting She will most likely need some diagnostic tests so if this involves travelling to find a new medical provider or to have her seen at a larger medical facility this is something you may need to do There can be numerous medical reasons for bruising so take any type of supplements at this point would be very premature The most important step is to find out the reasons FIRST I would suggest that you see your medical providerhave a few basic lab teststo see if you can get to the bottom of this Your orthopedist is the boss This is the expert that has evaluated and treated your fracture If the ortho said that you can bear weight at two weeks then this is what they want you to do Incidentally the fibula is not a weightbearing bone The tibia does all of the work I would not be able to blindly address your question as to what it is since I cannot see these sores  a vague description is just not sufficient I suggest that you see a medical provider or a dermatologist  someone who can physically examine you  in order to get a proper diagnosis and treatment You need to have you leg examined first  not something that can be done over the Internet If you do need treatment like an antibiotic this would need to be prescribed by a medical provider  other thing that cannot be done on line I cannot answer your question without a direct handson examination  obviously not possible over the Internet I strongly suggest two things See your medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated and two You are at risk for CAUSING an infection by doing this Just an odd coincidence There would be no medical explanation for this Doctors recommend many things that insurances refuse to cover as a payable benefitDoctors do not set the parameters of insurance policies so we are really at the mercy of those who write the checks You will not likely find any medical provider who will do that Making a determination about a skin lesion cancer or not is more that just the visual appearance It is the location size elevation etcAND a careful medical history Since you dont know what it is I would not suggest any home removal techniques Get an expertyour regular medical provider or a dermatologist to make this very important decision You dont have insurance and I cant see them over the Internet so we have a dilemma The only way that you can get an accurate diagnosis is for him to see a medical provider or dermatologist but your guess is very good These may indeed be molluscum contagiosum  very common childhood skin eruption If you didnt see the dent in the middle called an umbilication look closer with a magnifying glass It may be there Two years It is highly unlikely that your hair test will reveal any THC two years after you used it If your brother was specifically prescribed a diuretic by one of his physicians who are treating his lung cancer then yeshe should take it Each person on chemotherapy is uniqueoften taking different types and dosages of chemotherapeutic agents and not every person would need a diuretic Your brother appears that he does I wish your brother and family the very best on his treatment The back pain you are experiencing may have nothing to do with your scoliosis but may have everything to do with problems in your LOWER back I would suggest that you see a good back specialist orthopedist for a thorough examination She will need to specifically ask her doctor but I suspect he will not allow her to take buffered aspirin either I agree that she may need more than just Tylenol to control the pain so this is another item that needs to be addressed Many medical providers undertreat pain Your mother is 88 and deserves to have pain relief and be comfortable without being overly sedated Her doctor should be able to help with a different medication The most common complication of a burn a second degree burn based on your description would be a secondary skin infection A burn that is now red angry and painful may be infected The only way for you to be sure is to see a medical professional and be examineda description is just too vague to make a decision like that blindly Some clinicians are just more gentle than others For women I would suggest a female provider MD PA or nurse practitioner Not that men cannot be gentle I am a man but a woman provider should be much more sympathetic to your concerns Make the appointment and then call them personally a day or so before your exam to discuss your concerns Knowing that you have had a bad experience in the past should make them more understanding take their time and make this important exam lessstressful for you A small amount of bleeding can be expected with a pap sometimes but certainly the clinician can be a bit more gentle with the bimanual examination when feeling your uterus cervix and ovarian areas Penicillin is the drug of choice for Strep so maybe there was a Group B Streptococcal infection discovered prenatally that needed treatment This is relatively common This is just a guess however Your son and his GF can certainly answer that question if they want to you to know Here is some basic information to start including some wonderful reference sites httpwwwwebmdcombrainpostpoliosyndrome Every person with PPS is different so there risks would also be unique to them You are having various connective tissue problems like a torn rotator cuff but as you know this can happen to people who do not have PPS myself included When having surgery it would be good for your doctor to be familiar with PPS or you may have to educate him His inability to bear weight on this one leg does not necessarily mean the problem is in the hip It could be in the leg knee ankle or foot The reason many xrays are normal is that the problem may not even be due to a bone injury but rather muscle or tendon like a sprain These things do not show up on an xray I even had a nonwalking toddler with a thorn in his foot that no one noticed Toddlers can be wild and crazy and injury themselves in a zillion different ways without you even knowing it The fact that he has not improved in a week is concerning so I would suggest that you take him to see his regular doctor He may need to complete the entire leg xrays series if the doctor feels it is justified One quick story A patient of mine same age woke up from a nap and would not bear weight Several negative xrays negative exams and watchful waiting for three days did not seem him improve I coerced a orthopedic friend to work him into his busy and overbooked schedule so he agreed to see him over lunch This little guy who had been carried for the last three days ran through his waiting room jumped up on some chairs and acted like he did not have a care in the world To this day his parents and myself have no idea why he did not want to walk Perhaps he enjoyed being carried for a while Did you see my profile picture I look like a cross between Santa and Sasquatch There is absolutely nothing wrong with a man with hairy legs and chest but of course I am not speaking from the preferences of a woman I think men should look like mennot little hairless boys but to each his own The legs are only ONE problem when there are suspected peripheral artery disease A more critical artery would be the carotidsthe two main blood supplies to the brain The neck Doppler is to make sure the carotids are patent Scabies assuming he was accurately diagnosed is a HUMAN PARASITE It is passed on to him by another human It could be from someone the cares for him at the Sunday nursery or  It did not come from the faulty air duct Usually not Leg cramps are due to spasm of skeletal muscles the stomach cramps are smooth muscles an entirely different system Will sunburned legs hurt the baby No What can you do How about using some sunscreen next time so you will not have to deal with unnecessary pain Right now you can just use coolcold compresses The temporary pain you are experiencing is to remind you not to let this happen ever again When you have your baby you will need to carefully protect him or her from the burning rays of the sun too Nearly all varicoceles are on the left side and yes they may seem to pull your testicles higher up on that side but typically the weight of a varicocele is more likely to pull it downward  Right now you have a selfdiagnosis and may be correct but it is a good idea to have a medical provider examine you Intrascrotal masses can be confusing if you are not experienced in sorting them out Unfortunately without the ability to actually see this skin eruption that you are describing it would be very difficult if not impossible to blindly offer an accurate diagnosis A diagnosis is really essential when it comes to treatment Knowing your medical history will also help solve this mystery rash Based solely on your description this could be an allergic reaction perhaps urticaria hives Hives are intensely itchy comes on suddenly and if the allergen is still in your midst it can continue to persistspread Regardless of the cause which can be very challenging to find the itchiness can be treated with an antihistamine like diphenhydramine Benadryl or other overthecounter medications in this class Seeing a medical provider is important since many things can mimic hives Id say it was pretty unlikely due to atrophy of muscles but it all really depends on what causes her inability to walk in the first place The legs get pretty weak if you dont walk on them for twenty two years If she has a small amount of functionality maybe she could work up from there but there isnt enough information here to tell Lots of things can cause leg cramps including medications and medical conditions The most common causes and the most easily treatable are overexertion dehydration and electrolyte imbalence Do they usually happen at night Try this Make sure you are drinking enough water Get enough potassium calcium and sodium in the right balence This usually means if you are getting that twitchy feeling in your muscles drink extra water and eat a banana or a potato with the skin as well as a calcium supplement or Tums type antacid We usually arent too short on salt If you get a cramp in the middle of the night try to brace your foot against something to keep it from pointing and massage your leg as hard as you can Then get up and eat the banana or potato and drink water If this doesnt work talk to a doctor You need to get a tetnus shotbooster possibly infection have a doctor look at it Should of been cleaned with hydrgen peroxide when it happened To late now clean with soap and water then put antibiotic ointment on it and cover it with clean band aid or bandage and tape Gauze and tape My best friend just went through this an amputation immediately below the knee The surgery is extremely painful but docs give morphine my friend quit the morphine after 2 days because he didnt like not knowing what was going on He is still recovering  its been 2 months in the hospital The healing process  therapies involved take time and its a big challenge to learn to live with the prosthesis But if the amputation is necessary go for it because after 6 months its easier to live with  the reason for the amputation is gone Sounds like you are dehydrated Drink plenty of fluids  your muscles need water  fluids to help them work correctly Yes should go er now I hope feel better soon  Never cut if you cut it can be the cause of skin cancer so please dont do anything wrong with it directly go to the Doctor he will help you But most of the website also provide this some i know I m writing the name of that website scenicsun Sounds like cellulitis See your doctor immediately Slip  Fall The big question whose stairs did you fall down Thank goodness no broken bones Pictures I hope and call the doctor need more of something when is the follow up and do the follow up Watch out with the drugs stuff not necessary If it hurts get what you need and why did you fall  If its viral theres absolutely nothing you can do about it and its probably a virus called Roseola you simply just have to let your body fight the virus on its own until it eventually overcomes it I personally had this virus before and it lasted up to three months If its anything fungal it would definitely be itchy therefore I would safely rule that possibility out If its a bug bite seeing as how most bug bites become itchy and somewhat sensitive its unlikely to be a mosquito unless youre allergic to them and the bumps are massive in size my guess is that you have been bitten up by a spider of some sort yet not a black widow or a brown recluse seeing as how the center dimple of the bump would become much darker in color  and they tend to spew out pus as well Yes this is called L Hermittes sign and I have this symptom in my arms and legs Over time it has improved some but I still have the feeling of shocks if I move my neck quickly Hope this helps Sounds like low potasium pills should help but if pain gets to bad drinking a bottle of tonic water will take pain away almost instantly Do you know how thin your blood is I am NOT very knowledgeable in BP but if you are standing and sitting logically because blood is affected by gravity if you are on too much HBP meds thins blood your body might have an issue keeping it out of your legs which would also explain why sleeping helps it but again not my area of knowledge just an opinion Could be a liver issue too much sun and sometimes synthetic hormones will cause brown spots in which case they will disappear after a while Taking tricyline will also cause brown spots Hi This is really nice to know that you recently quit smoking Further to your question about the pain you are suffering from i do like to tell that these are the withdrawal symptoms of smoking As your body and brain is addicted to smoking for a long time and is carving for the same As a result of this you are facing such problems as joints such as my ankles elbows

hydrating My wife has Devics disease and has these electric shocks everyday all over her body but mostly in her legs Unresolved itching is a truly frustrating symptom for all patients to deal with Because this has been going on for some time you might want to get a medical evaluation to make sure you dont have a disease process that is causing the itching The fact that you have identified stress as a possible trigger tells me that while it may not be the source of your difficulty it certainly could be making it worse I would recommend that you look into stress reduction methods that are available in your area Some schools and universities offer programs in stress reduction meditation yoga etc Stress is hard on your entire body and could be negatively impacting other health systems as well as making your itching worse See what you can do about getting a diagnosis and try to learn to manage your stress levels Hyperpigmentation or dark spots will respond to a combination of chemical peels that contain salicylic acid alphahydroxy acids and skinbrightening agents such as hydroquinone licorice extract or bearberry Your physician will be able to implement a skin care regimen once any underlying medical causes are excluded Loose skin around the knees may be part of the natural aging process Extreme weight loss may lead to excess skin These issues may be addressed by a plastic surgeon Excess sun exposure is the No 1 cause of premature aging and wrinkling of the skin If you suffer from chronic swelling around your knees compression garments and support hose may be beneficial There are some creams that contain caffeine that help decrease the size of the blood vessels It may help diminish the appearance of your existing blood vessels Preventing the formation of more spider veins is easy if you protect your skin from the sun with sunscreen and vitamin antioxidants A C and E as well as having a healthy lifestyle Please dont pop it yourself Your skin is designed to protect itself and will stretch as much as possible in order to keep bacteria from entering a wound in the skin Allow the lesion to progress as it chooses Keep the area clean and dry and if it does pop cleanse the area with hydrogen peroxide and cover it with a clean and dry bandage to protect the area until it begins to heal As always watch for signs of infection Yes they can you should go to the Dr it sounds like you could have blood clots its a normal reaction it means that you are slightly allergic to alcohol It sounds to me like seed warts My daughter had them and i let the Drs burn them off and she has been scared scene I am not sure how to get rid of them but maybe you should check it out May be inner ear vertigo See your doctor The first answer to this question is just absurd Surgery Really May I suggest visiting a chiropractor since they deal with bones and the reason for the pinched nerve is caused by your spine not being aligned properly I had a pinched

the outer lower leg and only occurs in one leg at a time It has been found to be caused by sciatica as I had a back injury some time back I also suggest seeing an orthopedic surgeon physician or possibly a phsyiatrist for the root cause of the pain In the mean time you could take some over the counter painkillers like Codydramol or Advil to help relieve the pain temporarily Hope your pain is relieved soon Sounds like herniated disks in lower lumbar I would see a back specialist I have 2 on my lower back My leg goes numb and can hardly move sometimes I am on week 8 of physical therapy and

Most big problems start of as small problems that you dont address Treat back pain as a symptom of dysfunction not a cause The cause of back pain is rarely at the site of the pain Most people have slight postural imperfections which end up causing pain in other parts of their body Postural imperfections are magnified by such things as slouching over the computer holding the phone between ear and shoulder and by hand and foot dominance in the sports most regularly played Its not the chair its how you sit in it If muscles are not getting stronger theyre getting weaker

this I have also show my leg to him and my problem was solved httpearachetreatmentinfo I do not have this sympton u may have schiatic pain Mri is your best bet to find the exact problem xrays only take picture of bone There arent too many options with a herniated disc but a great chiropractor is my first option for me personally They can help ease the pain lessen the stress and if they are good enough they can fix the problem It could be time to go see a good chiropractor Most people dont see them as friendly but your problem could stem from a pinched nerve in your back to maybe a vertebra being just a little out of place Ive had all kinds of weird pains from my neck to my feet and I normally start at a chiropractor as long as its joint related Your talking the difference of a chiropractor 35120 a visit depending on whats done vs a hospital 200100000 and the hospital normally wont just pop your back and fix the real problem Chiropractor you might need simple stress reduction maybe an adjustment or a good massage Your treatment depends on the cause of orchitis In most cases where orchitis is caused by epididymitis treatment is an oral antibiotic such as cefalexin or ciprofloxacin until infection clears up For viral infections antibiotics are not recommended In both causes nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs such as naproxen or ibuprofen are recommended to relieve pain Sometimes stronger pain medications in the opiate category are called for and are frequently prescribed by experienced emergency room physicians You may be better of keeping in touch with

mother says she may be right especially if you are more on the thin side Prolonged pressure of a bony area on the skin can cause bruising after passing a board exam from the American Medical Massage Association and training under a chiropractor I worked in this area quite a bit The area that you are referring to is essentially the tail bone region so it makes sense that you would be having the sensation of rubbing in your hip bones Depending on where you live I would look for a massage therapist who is board certified you can gogle the American Medical Massage Association for a list of people who have passed the exam or you can always contact a reputable chiropractor If all else fails feel free to reach out to the Blue Heron Academy in Grand Rapids Michigan where they have a large referral database of people across the country who may be able to give you some pain relief through manual therapy accupuncture nutrition  herbs or chiropractic i have one leg which is swollen i had

factors including Increased pressure in the leg veins Damage to the leg veins Venous insufficiency Varicose veins often run in families You may be born with defective valves or weak walls in your veins or you may develop them later in life Varicose veins are more common in women than in men And varicose veins happen more often as people get older Varicose veins often develop during pregnancy They might become less prominent after pregnancy and may disappear completely Less commonly varicose veins may be a sign of a more serious problem that may sometimes need treatment These serious problems can include Blood clots or blockage in the deep veins or perforating veins Injury to the deep veins Abnormal blood vessels between arteries and veins arteriovenous fistulas A person may be born with these problems or develop them later in life Tumors very rarely WAS THE INJURY DEEP ENOUGH TO DAMAGE THE VEINS  no its upto you I had the same experience as you had I wasnt lifting weights but mowing the lawn I went to a chiropractor first and he diagnosed me correctly I had a herniated disc in my lower back that was pinching my sciatic nerve I was in such pain that I had to go see a doctor If the pain had been less the chiropractor could have treated me but it takes longer Yikes I wouldnt lift until you know what is wrong Hope this helps I would think the only way you would know for sure is to go to a dermatologist It could be an ingrown hair or something completely different I would go to the doctor or the pharmacist to see what they have to say If you say it looks infected then it will probably need medicine I wouldnt wait either That could be all sorts of things I would check out this slideshow and see if any of these images look like what you are experiencing I hope this helps Seems like there are a lot of treatment options both medication as well as stuff you can do at home From the article linked to below Good skin care is a key component in controlling eczema For some people with mild eczema modifying their skin care regime and making a few lifestyle changes may be all that is needed to treat eczema Other people with more severe eczema may need to take medications to control their symptoms Nondrug treatments for eczema include Mild soap and moisturizer  Its best to use a mild soap to avoid over drying your skin Gentle soaps known as syndets are available at the drugstore and brand names can be recommended by your doctor A good moisturizer in cream lotion or ointment form helps conserve the skins natural moisture and should be applied immediately after a shower or bath as well as one other time each day Some people with severe eczema may benefit from taking baths with a small amount of bleach added to the water The bleach helps to kill bacteria that lives on the skin of people with eczema Short warm showers  People with eczema should avoid taking very hot or long showers or baths which can dry out your skin Reduce stress  Take steps to reduce stress Get regular exercise and set aside time to relax Medications used to treat eczema include Hydrocortisone cream  Overthecounter hydrocortisone cream may help mild eczema Prescription steroid cream may be needed for more severe eczema Antihistamines  Oral antihistamines such as Benedryl are available overthecounter and may help relieve symptoms Some of these may cause drowsiness which may be of benefit if nighttime itching is a problem Corticosteroids  If other treatments fail your doctor may prescribe oral corticosteroids Always follow your doctors directions when taking oral steroids Light therapy People with very severe eczema may benefit from therapy using ultraviolet light Immunosupressants Medications that suppress the immune system may also be an option These medicines such as cyclosporine azathioprine  or methotrexate  may be used when other treatments have failed Immunomodulators  This newer type of medicated cream helps treat eczema by controlling inflammation and reducing the immune system reactions Examples include Elidel and Protopic  Heres the original article httpwwwwebmdcomskinproblemsandtreatmentseczemaunderstandingeczematreatment I had a hip replaced and was on a drug to prevent blood clotting That was something I was told to watch out for I would call my doctor I JUST FOUND OUT ALSO HAVE ARTHRITIS OF THE SPINE IVE BEEN DEALING WITH AWFUL LEG PAIN  SINCE FEB 2013 THOUGHT T WAS SAITIC NERVE TRIED EVERYTHING CHIROPRACTORMASSAGES PHYSICL THERAPYNOTHING HELPEDMY DRHAD ME GET XRAYS OF SPINENOW I KNOW ON MEDICNE REALLY HELPS IM 66YRS OLD LOVE DOING YARD WORK JUST NEED TO TAKE MY TIME NOW yes I get pain in hip and back back is al deformed from all this I also wear special shoes with splints in them it still is not enough and after a while I cant walk I have to sit down between short walks even small ones thru the grocery store or I use the carts or my cane the cane isnt enough because I have it in my hips back and feet Ok well I have to laugh right now because two days ago I got my ankle cast removed and it hurt so bad and I went back to the dr and got xrays again They said since my ankle was in the position to fix it for so long that my ankle had changed to repair and that it will take about a week or so to get straightend out and to be able to do normal I thought well gee you could have told me that when I got it removed or before I paid for more xrays you dont know how fustraited I was anyways it still hurts but its getting there and they said to do ankle flexers thats where you flex your ankleto me it hurts just as bad so then also to start adding more weight and to swing it back and forth with 510lb ankle weights hope your ankle gets better and feels better1 and try to find some easy exercises to do Sources just happend From my own experience it never did with me the six years prior to my rt leg and left foot amputationTake care of your feet though Not normal sounds like an allergy Id take some benadryl and get to a doctor ASAP It could be arthritis in your joint Id see my doctor if it didnt clear up after a reasonable amount of time I assume with all the tests restless leg syndrome was ruled out I had that and that was the diagnosis you could possibly have a deep vein thrombosis blocking blood flow to your lower legs in other words it could be a blood clot you should get to the doctor and have him do a doppler asap cat scratches can be serious keep the wound clean and be aware that there may be an infection there if you start to feel ill cold like symptoms i would contact the doctor i have already given an answer but feel i must advice you to seek medical attention if your leg is leaking fluid there is an infection if left too long the infection can travel to other parts of your body so please go to the hospital I have experienced the same thing  it is very scary The doctors attribute it to extreme acid reflux I am taking medication for the acid reflux and it helps however every now and then I eat more of a food I should eat in moderation  I overpower the medicine and once again have radiating pains in my chest throat and jaw Hope this helps  ask your doctor Good luck  Is he REALLY covered by them or just a few at each site you mentioned If hes REALLY covered it kind of sounds similar to bed bugs check out the photos online Do they seem to get better during the day only to be worse the next morning You could also have something called Cellulitus which left untreated can be fatal it is a form of staph and requires some atibiotics  if there is redness swelling and it feels like the skin has a fever then you should go see a doctor I work in spine and pain intervention and have often seen cases like this where someone who has suffered from either trauma prolonged infection or even surgery have developed neuropathic pain years later I would assume that youve already had the works as far as testing but it may be beneficial for you to have an EMG to help determine if there is any actual nerve damage Also a workup of your lumbar spine may be beneficial as well to help ruleout a bulging disc or other issue as the source of the problem Best wishes no its not normal and if it gets wors ide go to a doctor for more info I would suggest an AV Duplex scan on your lower extremities This diagnostic procedure can tell if there are blocked artery or veins that causes spasm It can likewise detect any calcification which causes narrowing of your arteries and veins Thanks Usually in the front radiating around to the side I too have a torn ACL and a bad meniscus I find that the best ab exercises for me are regular crunches six inches planks and leg lifts I would stay away from the bicycle crunches but thats the only ab exercise that has caused me knee pain His liver is in distress I have it too see a doctor now Yes I also have gotten VV from when I fell down my stairs so yes you can I hope this helps thank you and good luck to you and your Well you really need to take a pen or permanent marker and draw a circle around the bite this way you can keep track of the swelling and redness if it becomes I used to have problems with my thigh going numb and fall asleep then cramp up if I stood or lay down for a while or in certain positions Not necessarily damaged Id say more than likely its just under pressure probably from a herniated intervertebral disc This is a fairly common condition known as sciatica if you wish to look it up You can alleviate the symptoms with stretching and avoiding the irritation of the disc It could be from sitting for long periods of time for example well she has celiacs disease non life threatning disease but she can not have wheat so feed her corn based products like  some chex mix cerals corn tortillassome soups any thing that says gluten free on the label try doing a bicycle like leg exercise before you get out of bed in the moring Our treatment to make your life pain free We treat with the combination of advanced therapeutic electrotherapy and physical therapy techniques Our all therapist are DHA certified and holding a great experienced in treatments httpfcbsglobalcomaboutpainhtml I have this problem also all the time for years now and take Furosemide and Hydrochlorothiazide for this but I am also having to really lower my intake of sodium and get a lot more exercise Too much salt and not getting enough exercise WILL cause swelling and numbness and tingly sensation in feet ankles legs face hands and fingers Also a pinched nerve in the neck andor lower back will cause this as well I cannot sleep on my back without waking up with my face eyes hands and fingers swollen numb and tingling and this is because I have had 3 herniated disks in my neck and even with epidural shots in the disks to take the swelling off the nerves the pressure of sleeping on my back causes the disks to press against the nerves which will cause all the swelling and numbness The major thing though is the salt intake amount and lack of exercise When I cut out the salt and move around more by cleaning house gardening mowing the lawn get on my exercise bike and work at the restaurant and try not to stay on my back at night when sleeping the swelling and fluid retention is reduced tremendously Also drinking at least 10 16 ounce glasses of water everyday is a big help towards this My prescription water pills which are also BP meds plus all that drinking of water everyday usually will knock out all that swelling and numbness I hope this helps you because I know how uncomfortable and miserable all this swelling makes you feel get second opinion from nerophysician It might be a menicus tear I have one go to an orthopedic surgeon get an MRI It should confirm a tear in the menicus 0  I had my right knee replaced 11 months ago The surgeon will take several images of your thigh knee and leg and send scans off to some place that will design a customize replacement just for your knee  Mine was made of stainless steel My doctor had an actual one to show me in his office So I do not think that anything else would be changed I asked a half dozen friends the name of the surgeon who replaced their knee and chose the doctor most frequently mentioned  of course I asked if they would use himher again if needed During my inhouse physical therapy I met 3 patients who had both knees replaced  Jokingly I added that it sound like a crazy thing to do The responses were  since each knew that the other one would eventually need replacing 1 for insurance reasons 2 to minimize time taken off from work Hope this helps and good luck PS Since my right knee was replaced it took several weeks before I could drive my car You might want to take this into consideration  I would suggest laying in bed and put both legs up and  pretend you are riding a bicycle do for a few minutes several times a day and eventually increase the time you are riding I bought my mom a 3wheeled bike and borrowed my neighbor child bike to accompany her If you are a senior the local senior citizens center might have an exercise room and its not only fun visiting with the person next to you but new friendships may occur An important factor is to have someone with you that will help you make this a priorityset a time to meet Unless youre doing this in bed ha ha Youve probably been told to keep your legs up whenever possible Put a recliner in front of the tv else find an inexpensive foot rest to put in front of your chair if the top is hard just put a cushion on it And dont forget to have at least 2 pillows under your legs while you are sleeping And last dont wear socks that leaves a crease around your ankles or calvesthis will affect the blood flowing to your legs and feet You might want to consider buying a pair of diabetic socks that have a loose top Hope this helps Cant help you with both questions but my husband was often asked if he was on blood thinners because of so many bruises on arms and hands He was NOT on any thinners but 4 years later he was diagnosis with Myleodisplastic Syndrom MDS which is a disease of the bone marrow where the platelets and red  white blood cells are produced Because he is in his 70s there is no chance of getting a bone marrow transplant You might recall a cohost Robin Roberts on Good Morning America ABC was lucky enough that her sister was an ideal match I just wished that some doctor had looked into my husbands problem of the vast amount of skin bruises years ago After 10 months Robin rejoined her show and looks great Perhaps youre not old enough for this to apply to you but keep in mind if you have older relatives who bruise for no apparent reason It could be a type of skin cancer Yes It could be a recurrence of the same problem In other words can you generally pinch a lymph node in the skin fold or are they more attached feeling  I can feel underneath the bump when I pinch it in the skin I didnt think you could do that with a node Try using nair  Use a clean wash cloth  heat with hot water as hot as u can stand apply to infected area hold with pressure till cloth cools repeat 5 times continue until fluid starts draining then use a dressing to cover if sore does not open after repeating process for four days go see dr use a clean wash cloth heat with hot water as hot as u can stand apply to infected area repeat 5 times or until soar opens and drains if draining cover with clean dressing if after 4 days of doing hotcompresses if soar has not opened go to DR I would say then its related somehow to the Sciatic nerve See a neurologist I also hurt my back a few years ago I ended up having surgery but the leg numbness tingling kept getting worse I done a nerve test I forgot what the name of test was at the hospital and it showed I had nerve damage in back and both legs One doctor said it was because doctor let the disc press on the nerves too long I now have to have a second surgery because they failed to fix a tear between l4 and l5 Please make sure you see a neurosurgeon instead of an orthopedic doctor They really messed me up My damage is permanant please see a doctor soon so maybe you can fix it before its too late have you been tested for anything myself i have those same things on my legs mostly but i just found out i have hep c which can cause the skin to do that and skin not heal like it use to before haven caught itits always good to be tested you may want your dr to see if your sacroiliac joints are out of alignment sitting does aggravate the pain and stretching the area is not good for them either if you are having a problem with them i am currently having mine looked at bc i havent been able to walk right and have had extreme pain in the area for over 2 years i hope you get some answers soon Well the rapid heartbeat could be caused by several factors Do you ingest a lot of caffeine Do you smoke cigarettes Are you prone to anger

my butt cheek But i cant find anything on google about It hurts soooo bad and gave me a fever for a day I finally managed to pull the white out and it was a hard but squishy mass so now there is a hole in my cheek The pain hasnt gone away so i think there may be more in there I know this was posted a while ago but what did it end up being my mother in law has that and the dr says it is vasculitas i do not have a herniated disc At 22 years of age dont gamble with suppliments and home remedies see an ortho specialist Ive had several knee injuries and two minuscus surgeries as a result

best deals Other problem could be your loosing bone and need to see a doctor Another guess would be your shoes good luck oh sure just be careful no traidmil if its your leg It could be nerve related I think a Dr visit is necessary and probably an xray Before Your visit write down all of your symtoms like doing the day does the pain get better Also are you having any kidney problems You may have Osteoarthritis see your doctor could be the medicine your taking or something you changed like laundry soapfabric softener ete that could be Sciatic Nerve being pinched somewhere in the lower lumbar or sacrum area For the edema I had to get my lungs drained with a needle and have a Thoracentesis done which drains excess fluids between lungs and lining of lungs This helped tremendously Also try

injured in any way that would have caused this We have to stand in derby stance which is basically a squat position and do crossovers It seems the crossovers are what really hurt my leg Im guessing

to have back pains and it can be more on one side or another just because the baby can be laying on one side more than the other If the baby is laying more in your back it can cause it but with it being more than the other I bout gurantee that the baby is just laying on that side more which heshe could be laying on the siatic nerve which can be painful I have had 4 so I know the feeling Hope you get feeling better Take care of your diarrhea firstGet a good doctor who speicalizes in that area Get off the soft drinks The diarrhea is draining out all energy You can die from diarrhea that last for a long period of time my niece had something similar that was long lasting it was a form of viral infection that was recurring It could be from a plant or some kind of poison oak that you wernt aware of may be in your yard some bodys house or being out in the woods you have the same thing almost like I have going on with me but mine is on my right inner thigh itchy raised dry rash Im just using over the counter antiitch cream good luck restless leg symdrom sounds like to me sounds like it may be have circulation issues Thank you for the information it was in fact within the last 2 days but as we plan on starting a family soon after we get married in 2 months so if we are we are gonna welcome the blessing from God I was just curious as to whether there was a very high possibility or not Woke around 6 am with terrible bloating right upper abdomen and back pain pain has persisted to increase through out the day as well as my temp Diareah started shortly after waking in 1015 minute frequency and has lasted the entire day with legs cramps starting around noon vomiting as well but not as often with dizzy spells and imidium has not helped at all Was able to hold a little chicken soup doen and gatorade I had fusions at l45 L5S1 and the thing I noticed in post op was that pain in my leg was gone But If I was in the same pain I was in before last surgery I think I might check out a couple other Drs And They would be the leading Drs in their field The more you get cut on the more sscar tissue pain and neurilogical pain  Thats a tough Question Have you considered a pain pump I wouldnt trade mine for anything good luck I had a similar problem Was having periods night and day I had finally put a very physically and mentally husband in my rear views I got to know a fellow and it was past the 3rd date etcccU know my gyn went in with laser to clean out pallops and such and it worked nearly 2 yrs Then the 2nd time he said it was unlikely i would ever see a period again othr than some spotting But itwas gone He forgot and 2appts after that he figured out i had been in menopause early onset for the last year and half He really is a good dr but he had a few to many babies popping out and threw him off his game If this pain is worse when driving or sitting long periods you may have a disc in the Ls such as L1 lumbar 1 the disc could be leaking or even gone and you have bone on bone in which case you are one tough individual I know that pain My surgery fixed that I woke in the recovery room telling anyone who listened my leg doesnt burn111 dONT SEE A ORTHOPEDIC DR A NEUROLOGIST that is atleast in the top ten will do He will likely offer alterior route that doesnt require narcotics Best of luck Pickle juice Every football player in America can tell you its great for leg cramps definitely shin splints or small fractures in the bone they are hard to get rid of but see ortho Rashes may burn at times due to the cause If you cut your leg in the same region of the rash before the rash showed up it could be an infection If you itched the rash it could cause burning if you cracked the skin Dry skin can also cause a warming sensation More information needed to give you a correct answer If you start experiencing pain in the same region as the sores I would suggest making an appointment with your doctor ASAP The sores could become infected and may require hospitalization If I was in your position I would more than likely visit the ER Just my suggestion Good luck Anytime you fall it is a cause for concern if you experience pain especially lower back pain You could be experiencing anything from nerve damage to a torn muscle I would suggest that you visit your doctor as soon as possible Only a doctor could correctly diagnose this problem through xrays It sounds like you quite possibly may have damaged something within your knee Get it checked out as soon as you can  Just 3 days ago I had the same occurance I had just logged into my computer and minutes later a pain struck the left side of my back right by my left kidney I tolerated it for 2 hours as I was in a training class the pain became more intense I figured it was just a spasm then maybe its my kidney as I had surgery in 2000 due to a 5 diameter hematoma and 3 months ago I was punched in the same kidney by my abusive husband I hobbled to my boss to inform him and that I could no longer endure the sharp throbs of torture He had me to grab my notebook to study at home but the extra 2lbs of weight was too heavy and I nearly lost my balance I was not allowed to drive myself home instead a manager dropped me at the nearest hospital After CT scans blood and urine work they could only diagnose me to have acute back pain gave me scripts for Lortab and Valium with a injection of Morphine and Benadryl from the outbreak of whelps where the IV was stabled discharged me home where i was bed ridden and slept away 2 days They gave me symptoms of what causes acute back ache since i didnt twist it it also stated from prolonged sitting35 weeks of sitting with 2 15 minute breaks and a half hour My back couldnt take another day so why cant this be considered  workers comp well they termed me for a 3 day absence with medical document which is 3 points but you have to have 12 to be termed humm norma gerena Most time numbness is a sign of a nerve being pinched or restricted in some way Could be a pinched nerve or bad disc in lower back You say there has been no indication of poor circulation but I am curious what are those indicators Has a doctor told you this Have they done a ultrasound to check the circulation If so I would have an orthopedic doc check you out to see if this is back related By chance are you a diabetic This can cause leg and foot issues When I got blood clots in my leg I had muscle pains in the back that were very intense but no pain in my shins Id get it checked out for sure though Dont know Dont know Dont know Your shocks can absolutely positively be caused by your MS I get the sensation of being tasered from my elbows through my hands These shocks have literally lifted me inches off the couch or bed they are so powerful I spent 10 days in the hospital with an EEG and 6 months later on an ambulatory EEG at home Seizures were ruled out So great once again I find out what its not The best answer I get is that they are a complication of MS The still hurt like hell though This sounds like strep throat My husband has RLS also If he doesnt take his meds a couple of hours before bedtime his arms flail violently along with his legs Are you on medication for your RLS If you are and still having problems you might need your dose adjusted My husband had to have his adjusted after about 10 years on his medication called Pramipexole Mirapex i cant say for sure what is going on but you seem to be in tune with the things your not doing right i would go speak to your doctor about it first thing then def try to up take in water water is life without it everything in your body will slowly begin to break  also eatting right it not that hard to add healthy things into your everyday habbits there so many thing you can do that dont take much time at all ex try not eatting carbs after 4 pm meaning no pasta no bread no cookies and cakes chips anything high in carbs  your body makes insulin that breaks down crabs and turns them into engery  after late after noon your body stops making this and all carbs eaten after that time frame become stored as fat also with a uptake on water will help flush out anything bad in your system try to eat thing that have color i ate very bad for a long time and with a lil bit of trying was able to make a world of difference  i feel better and look better  also smoking i cant say anything about that im a smoker as well and we both know its very bad but i know quitting isnt easy or i would have done it already but i do try not to take my cigarettes outside with me when im doing things so i dont smoke as much  it helps me a lil its not a bad idea to try to also swelling could happen from lack of water and a lot of salt in your diet  try to take care of these things little everyday choices and change your life  i hope this helps USE PAIN PATCH Get into a dr asap never know what going on But that a few signs somethings not right Hope all turns out I would think it could happen but probably not to the extent of the ripping of childbirth More like a small cut caused by extra streching of the labia Most likely it is like any small cut and you can help it heal by keeping the area clean especially after sex The stinging is caused by the fluids getting into the cut and it will probably sting a bit when you clean it as well To prevent this as much as posiible make sure you are use enough lubrication and that your not to vigorous in that position Yesit can cause pressure on nerves and cause pain Have you checked with a spine specialist or chiropractor 1st  most important thing would be to rule out blood clot or atherosclerosis since you have had angioplasty in the past if you have had an injury there could be a blood clot Even without injury could be a blood clot especially if you a more sedantary lifestyle try excersizeing more fast oftenand harder Possibly but could also be due to soft tissue issues with the ligaments muscles etc There is also something called a Bakers Cyst that can form behind the knee that might cause these symptoms could it be radiculopathy YES most definitely Especially if there is no reason as a bump or hit to your body that would cause a bruise Anemia is associated with bruising but your symptoms seem more serious Vitamin C supplements help thicken the skin but need to be taken in large doeses Personally I took 3000 mil daily until symptoms disappeared Time released vitamin C taken morning noon and night daily with offer results within 30 days You didnt mention whether you have swelling or whether the extremity feels hot to the touch symptom of a blood clot You may have a varicose vain if swelling pain are not present I would certainly check with my doctor Better to be safe then sorry Did your husband have flu symtoms such as congestion and coughing prior to the lower back pain My wife and I both have the same issue Congestion cough brought on by the congestion a day of pink eye and now the sore back I have had shingles and I only had it around my upper back but I know it can apprear just about anywhere I would highly reccommend seeing a doctor because even though it can go away without antibiotics I believe it can also get worse and be very miserable It is up to you if it seems to be improving then maybe you dont need to but if its spreading then you definitely should see a doctor It can get pretty serious if left untreated I would not recommend going around someone who is pregnant even though shingles is spread through direct contact just because it can be very serious and it isnt something someone who is pregnant should be exposed to Thanks for your question its an interesting topic I just read a new study regarding numbness in different areas of the body The study said that all through the spine there are small nerves that are connected to every part of the body Sometimes when youre stresseddont feel good or your spine is misalinged even slightlyit can make those nerves fire off and cause numbness in the part of the body the nerves are connected to Your friend doesnt automatically have Neuromotor Disease or anything serious like that She just needs to start with a chiropractic consultation who if need be can refer her to a spine specialist if it is indeed the nerves in the spine firing off I hope this helps in anywayat least so you or she can know where to start looking at Hi I have had similar experience due to my condition which is hypotuatrisum growth hormone deficient I have that when my testosterone is low hope that helps AFTER KNEE REPLACEMENT I FELT IT WOULD BE NORMALIN TIMEIVE HAD TWO OTHER OTHROSCOPIC KNEE SURGERYS AND FOUR SHOULDER OPERATIONSTHEY ALL HEALED 100MY SUREGON SAID TWO YEARSNOW MY NEW DRSAYS IT WILL ALWAYS DO THAT sounds like gout or some type of arthritisinflamation you should see a foot doc asap drink lots of water and it will help the gout pain if it is gout and drink alot of homemade lemonade made out of real lemons I suggest you get a blood test for him My daughter had similar symptoms that were attributed to bruises for normal play she was 3 at the time Her bruises first appeared on the shins and seemed to stay in the legs She also got Pitikia tiny red spots that are broken blood vessels on her chest and stomach area and after about the 3rd day she got blisters in her mouth that looked black like blood blisters A blood test revealed she had ITP a blood disorder low platelet count Her case was an acute one time situation but she was monitored with blood tests for 6 months Her case was severe requiring a hospital stay and medication to increase her platelets Im not a doctor just a mom with this experience Her symptoms were minimized by doctors until they got the results from the blood test and then they had me rush her to the hospital Better to be safe then sorry I suggest you request a blood test I had pain for over a decade Hard getting out of bed and going to bed Cold weather and dampness increases it My PCP recommended I move to Floridawarmer climate Sounds great but really UghhhhDoctors didnt know what else to do with me Jokingly I replied just take me out to the pasture and shoot me I felt helpless I felt no one believed me Very frustrating Been thru so many tests lots of xrays blood work etc The most reliable test would be an MRI and nerve conduction tests Not happy with the dx but I have Fibromyalgiasomething that is not easily detected or believed by med providers It is something I have to deal with for the rest of my life All one can do is take it one day at a time Always thank the Lord for another day I wish you well God bless you and yours I did not like Requip It made my thinking very fuzzy I accidently found that quinine worked with no side effects I found it at Walmart in health type supplements for restless legs I have CMT CharcotMarieTooth Disease a form of Muscular Dystrophy and drink Schwepps Tonic Water to relieve leg and arm cramps Tonic water contains quinine at low levels I have found that when chilled the Tonic Water tastes similar to grapefruit juice Quinine pills are also available but I have read that gastrointestinal distress can result from the pills I hope this helps you Please make an appointment with your Dr to rule out any potentially serious cause for your symptoms Blood in your stool can be attributed to a number of things so do not be unnecessarily alarmed Chronic fatigue can also be attributed to simple lack of sleep A trip to your Dr should give you the answers that you need What usually causes swelling and pain in both feet and legs is water retention I have the same problem and I take water pills to help reduce the fluid that my body does not release on its own You can cut down on your salt intake as well as talk to your doctor The swelling in your legs could also be an early sign of Congestive Heart Failure CHF Ibuprofen will help with the pain as well as the inflammation I hope this has helped answer your question sounds like sciatic nerve damage following restless leg syndrome i have it and its horrible i am a nurse and have fibromyalgia and its caused me to have all sorts of issues see the doctor for meds and therapy nerve damage or neorapthy but sounds like nerve damage for sure have u been n any accidents or anything at home or work yes esp if the doctor hit a nerve i have them now from injections hypoglycemia and fibromyalgia on other systoms i have it and had all those systoms i dont know and would like to  you probably are sick ask your dr as you arnt going to get a answere here i have tried ten times and no luck multiple problemssee your doctor not just one try castor oil every time after bath for itchiness benadryl for allergiesask your doctor about restless leg symptomscould be a problem with leg nerveshiccups ussually is trapped air chew your food slowerno carbonation for a daysee if that helps Might have a herniated disk like I had once It hurts terribly multiple causes including weakness in muscles and joints balance issues and vision problems including loss of depth perception also last night an alarm went off so i sat up in bed really fast and hurt my shoulder again the pain has been off and on for the day but for the most part i really dont feel anything  but did it anywaysWorkout on Monday came around my arm shoulder didnt hurt i was actually feeling good and strong lol Anyways i got through my first 10 reps at bench a measly 135lbs my shoulder started to burn thinking nothing of it i continued onto my second set another 10 lbs up at about 8 reps my shoulder actually started to hurt and burn sting all of those type of things On my 3rd set it was again 10 lbs higher got to about 6 before my shoulder wouldnt really take it anymore i know it wasnt the smartest thing to do but i guess i was in denyal that i messed up my shoulder prior to that So i pretty much couldnt work out the rest of the time I did some biceps workouts that didnt hurt my shoulder and some curls that didnt hurt it at all Next day i was told by my nco to go and talk to the medic Probably should have mentioned im currently in the US Army deployed to afganastan So a medic looks at my shoulder doesnt really know too much about it gets the SSG incharge of the aid station to look at it rotates it hears a verbal pop and feels grinding It was tender Day 3 it bearly hurt at all day 4 whenever now is doesnt really hurt at all It feels awkward at times but doesnt hurt i broke my profile they gave me by lifting a saw and other things but it doesnt really seem to hurt they are saying i could have partially torn the rotator cuff or labram but how could it not hurt if i tore something If it was torn wouldnt it take more time than a day or two Also there was a pressure sensitive spot under my shoulder by my armpit that hurt pretty bad to the touch but doesnt hurt anymore either could it just be tendonittis as long as they are not red around the area and not itching you should be safe I had this in my younger years like late 20s early 30s my doctor said it was simply acidic sweat and to put baby powder on it for 3 to 5 days IT WORKED I also had the same thing between my legs and oddly enough the seam or crack in the skin  that connects the ear to the head i have low vitamin d so my doctor put me on 2 vitamin d3 2000 ius international units a day but yes if it is low those pains will relate to your vitamin d levels i had the same pains hope this helps I had the same type of pain My doctor said the femoral nerve was being compressed in my back and sent me for therapy I was very doubtful about this but after a few weeks of therapy the pain disappeared The main exercise was No Because you are saying that when you are on medicaid that if you are suffering some illness or disease you cant be treated this is a sign of anxiety you have it under control but still go and see your doctor for more elvaluation Did they give him pain or antibiotic medications See if the symptoms started the same time he started the pain meds or any other meds they may have given he could be having an allergic reaction The best and safest bet is to call his surgeon immediately or just take to the hospital and have the take a look right away He good be developing an infecton as well Good luck and God Bless After 2 months it is definitely better Very little back pain but some pain in the leg Will give it more time but no surgery at the present time I had knee replacement in August 2012 and still have numbness from knee to ankle and stiffness and tightness extending around to calf I wouldnt think that would cause it Sounds like osteoarthritis maybe Sounds to me like you have something causing pressure on a nerve that runs down the leg It sound like kidney damage I have similar symptoms of knee pain as you show I also get mine from standing too long in lines or while Im at work I was diagnosed some years ago as having weak ligaments in both knees I spent 6 weeks in intense physical therapy that included mild electro shock therapy on the muscles and ligaments Once I was cleared from pt they gave me a series of exercises to do on a daily basis and it helped One of them was to find a door way that has a slight step up or use a block to stand on and with your knee that is hurting slowly lower your other foot down to the ground and come back up about 10x to start with You also should probably see a doctor to make sure there is no issue as far as a torn or inflamed acl tcl or mcl I was diagnosed with HSV2 genital herpes last year andunless you have had intercourse or oral sex with someone who is a carrier of the herpes simplex virus ie they had a cold sore or outbreak on their mouth and performed oral sex on you or they had an outbreak of genital herpes and you had unprotected intercourse It was at one point thought that the two virus strains would not interchange however studies are showing that one will carry to another just the same or are a known carrier for the herpes simplex virus either 1 or 2 it is a ridicously extreme long shot that you got genital herpes from a sunburn as there is no virus or fluid exchange involved However if you are a carrier or have participated in sexual acts with a carrier the answer is yes you can have an outbreak of genital herpes in your upper leg area and anywhere around the genital area including your gluteus maximus butt and anal area as well as even going down your legs in an extreme outbreak The best thing to do is to go to a doctor and get a proper diagnosis on the blister I have found that just before I have an outbreak I will get some tenderness in the back of my upper leg just below my butt cheek on the side of my body that the outbreak is going to occur This is usually followed by a few days of itching or a burning sensation where the outbreak is going to occur The good news is that if you have contracted genital herpes there are many effective medications that you can take to control the outbreaks unfortunately there is no cure at this time for either HSV1 or 2 Typically pregnancy will cause hormone fluctuations which may cause your wife to want sex more often than usual I guarantee you that this is entirely normal I had injections 6 days ago in low spine Woke this morning with bad muscle cramps in my thighs and caves Later in the day I even was having cramps in my shoulders I also had a headache in the top of my head that lasted most of the day I do not know if it is the medicine or the fluid loss from the shots It is nice seeing my ankles look normal again the steroids did that but maybe I lost too much fluid no but have bulging disk and nerve conduction problems per emg test Pickle juice has salts and electrolytes in it much like gatorade which replaces the electrolytes you lose through sweating preventing cramps My cousin played football in high school in georgia and he says the football team would drink pickle juice during 2 a days in the summer to stay hydrated He swears by it and says itre hydrates faster than water Go to the emergency room You could be having something called compartment syndrome This may have been caused by too many different things to mention The most important thing is to maintain circulation in the leg which could be compromised according to your description of your leg Call 911 Advil how do I treat occasional diarrhea in my dog Check all your medication for side effects Need to get MRI of back for any spine disorders Exercise moderately to strengthen back muscles Bed bugs he needs to see a doctor there is something wrong with his blood oxygen levels "}
