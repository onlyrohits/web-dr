by a medical expert Im just throwing some ideas to you in an attempt to be helpful I hope that you obtain the answers that youre seeking and feel well soon  Lets start off with your question regarding the relationship between acne and heavy sweating Sweat does not cause acne Especially during the teen years hormone levels can stimulate excessive oil production Along with those hormones circulating throughout the body causing the excess oil the skin is going through a stage of change that predisposes it to clogging That pore clogging can develop into pustules pimples whiteheads and blackheads Most foods do not cause acne With that said it is suggested to eat a healthy and balanced diet Some anecdotal accountings recommend either reducing or eliminating chocolate carbonated beverages caffeine products excess sodium and fried foods Despite extensive marketing through info commercial and lofty prices there is no silver bullet product solution to curing acne Here are some recommendations and treatment that can lessen the acne outbreaks Even though acne is not directly caused by dirt keep your face clean and free of excess bacteria can reduce pore clotting Do not be overly aggressive in the face washing Applying too much pressure to the affected areas can actually aggravate the situation From my own teenage years applying an astringent following face washing was very beneficial Cleaning pads containing salicylic acid can cause improvement and are relatively cost effective Be careful about using coverup makeup products which can further cause pore clotting Do not be tempted to pop the acne blisters as this may cause spreading and infection Keep your body well hydrated and exercise on a regular basis Sleep for eight hours each night You can search out acne home remedy treatments The internet is loaded with various homemade recipes that may help A paste made up of common everyday products such as baking soda and lemon juice work for some individuals If improvement does not occur within 2 months of applying the above principles then it is time to consult with a doctor They may prescribe medications such as RetinA Accutane Antibiotics and others to treat the acne Stay calm and positive Do not become overly stressed and allow acne to control your life With extra efforts directed at maintaining optimal physical health you should see positive results in reducing acne Your bodys sweating response to high outdoor humidity conditions seems quite normal The human body is equipped with a thermostatic like system that causes us to perspire Sweating is the bodys way of trying to keep us cool and contributes in maintaining an optimal temperature The human body is susceptible to humidity The skin relies on air circulation in order to absorb the moisture produced through sweating The more humid it is the less air the skin is able to get High humidity can be dangerous During warm weather the best way to deal with humidity is to keep the body cool This may mean staying indoors in an airconditioned room during intense periods of high humidity Keep yourself well hydrated while being outdoors during high heat and humidity in order for perspiration and cooling to occur YOU need to see your doctor immediately You need an MRI or CT of the spine You could have a herinated disk and or numerous other things when you are talking about anything to do with the spine And with the other symptoms you are having if they have NOT resolved by now RUN to the ER or at least see your own doctor asap this is nothing to play around with I KNOW for fact Broke my neck at level C3 and 5 just lifting a patient You could have injuries that could paralize you Hope this helps at least to make you aware that anything to do with the spine is life changing take them to the hospital For your any dental problem plz click here  confidentdentalcare  For your any dental problem plz click here  confidentdentalcare  For your any dental problem plz click here  confidentdentalcare  dont know dont know I love the sports block gels for men because even if you sweat and you are very athletically active outdoors or if you are working outdoors they tend not to run and get into the eyes so look for one thats in a gel A lot of the new products come in powder gels where they really feel quite dry And they dont feel sticky on the skin so men dont mind using them as much The spray ones are also good but look for one that says continuous spray not a mist because a mist still has to be rubbed in you are not getting full coverage With the continuous spray it means anytime you are pressing down on that pump you are getting product out and thats much better This could be a condition called folliculitis due to friction and sweating It may help to use a cleanser with salicylic acid and a topical antibiotic afterwards such as clindamycin gel this is a prescription product If a child has a documented  do not promote more heating by piling on blankets Instead use a cool washcloth to the forehead or back of the neck However dont overdo that either You dont want your child to become so cool he or she is shivering Not all fevers need to be treated Sometimes theyll get better on their own A fever over 103 degrees Fahrenheit in a toddler deserves medical attention according to the American Academy of Pediatrics I hope your little one feels better soon The short answer is No it cant If I understand your question correctly youre asking if the drug methadone can be transmitted through bodily fluids from a person who has taken it to a person who has not taken it This is not possible In fact its not possible with any drug whatsoever In other words you cant get high from methadone or develop an addiction to methadone by having sex with someone who takes the medication I hope that clears things up for you Its possible you have a fungal infection commonly called   This can occur when you dont completely dry the groin area after exercising and showering The skin of the groin area is home to many beneficial bacteria However when this area remains damp it can allow other bacteria to flourish This can result in a fungal infection Assuming you dont have any lesions sores pimples  that sort of thing its probably safe for you to try an overthecounter spray powder or cream for jock itch Youll find these products near the medications for athletes foot To prevent jock itch be sure to towel dry as much as possible then apply a powder or cornstarch to help keep the area dry If youre unsure about whether you actually have jock itch or if the overthecounter treatment doesnt help the problem by all means visit your health care provider to determine what is going on Hope this helps Im sorry to hear your son went through that Im sure it was quite distressing The technical term for what your son experienced is   This happens to many people when they are about to get poked with a needle A vasovagal attack is the most common cause of fainting What happened to your son will have no lasting health effect He should be fine Your son can help prevent this from happening in the future by letting medical personnel know he has fainted in the past from a needle stick It is nothing to be ashamed of When we know of this in advance we can help patients to relax and avoid fainting during a procedure Your son also should focus on taking slow deep breaths the next time he has to have blood drawn This will help him avoid fainting Wishing you well Im sorry youre going through this How awful Id suggest you make an appointment with a psychotherapist What youre describing sounds like  and it may take more than medication to address this issue may not even be the best medication for your situation Its true clonazepam is prescribed for anxiety attacks but its clearly not working There are other medications available Furthermore your situation may require a more wellrounded approach that includes cognitive talk therapy to address the issues that are triggering your panic attacks due to driving Please dont feel shy about seeking out psychotherapist Its often the case that just a few sessions can significantly improve conditions like yours that involve a single activity that causes panic Meanwhile take care while driving Youre doing the right thing by pulling over as needed If possible take public transportation or carpool with a coworker until your panic attacks subside I wish you all the best So sorry to hear youre going through this It sounds miserable If you had been taking hormone replacement therapy but went off it some time ago it doesnt seem likely your symptoms are related to lack of estrogen If on the other hand you stopped HRT relatively recently then your symptoms could indeed be related to a reduction in your female hormone levels Because other health issues can cause the symptoms you describe Id suggest you visit your primary care provider for an evaluation He or she may have you get some blood work done to try to determine the cause of your symptoms I wish you all the best Im sorry youre going through this It sounds awful Are you positive you dont have  I mean has a medical professional told you you dont have diabetes or blood sugar problems Diabetes can develop slowly over time So if you have not had a checkup within the past year its possible you have diabetes and dont even know it Id suggest you see your primary health care provider soon for a routine physical examination The lab work will help tell if you have developed diabetes People who are overweight sedentary dont get a lot of exercise eat processed food or junk food and drink a lot of sugary sodas are at higher risk of developing diabetes Diabetes can lead to other health problems including blindness and foot ulcers These are more good reasons to go in for a checkup I wish you all the best Im sorry to hear youre going through this frightening experience On the plus side you and your doctor are doing everything right it sounds like All the tests you listed are appropriate for diagnosing whats causing your symptoms Unfortunately your health care provider just hasnt been able to pinpoint the problem yet I wish I had an answer for you but the symptoms you describe could be caused by many many things Thats why your health care provider is running so many tests The only thing I can offer is empathy for your situation It is so hard to be patient when you are experiencing severe symptoms like this and see yourself losing weight I hope your doctor is able to come to a diagnosis quickly Meanwhile dont forget to lean on friends for support Venting your anxiety may help you feel better I wish you all the best Theres really not much point in washing your face before exercise You need to cleanse your skin exercising and sweating in order to make sure you dont develop blocked pores or possible fungal infections of the skin Interestingly its equally important to thoroughly dry your skin after exercising Fungal infections such as   can arise if the skin stays damp So be sure to towel off thoroughly and perhaps apply powder if you cant get completely dry PS Women can get jock itch too Hope this helps Im sorry to hear you go through this and if it helps Ill share this It happens to me too Some people are just naturally prone to flushing when theyre embarrassed angry or otherwise experiencing heightened emotions Have you ever noticed whether or not your neck flushes for no reason at all Mine does Sometimes I can just be sitting around minding my own business get up to go to the bathroom and notice my necks all red What the heck I dont know if theres any medical explanation for this Ive noticed personally that it seems to happen more in fairskinned people of north European descent It could simply be that flushing which is caused by increased blood flow just beneath the skin is more visible in fairskinned people I dont know If possible try to learn to live with this unique trait When people tease me about this I laugh right along with them I say things like Some people wear their heart on their sleeve I wear my emotions on my face If the anxiety aspect bothers you dont hesitate to seek counseling from a trained psychotherapist Anxiety can be managed through cognitive therapy talk therapy and medication if warranted A counselor also can help you cope with the embarrassment you feel about the flushing I wish you all the best as a kindred spirit Im hoping you meant to type 102 degree fever because 112 degrees would send most people into seizure and death Im sorry youre going through this It sounds like you are absolutely miserable While I cannot diagnose you via internet I will say you are describing the classic  Fever coughing weakness and general misery are the hallmarks of influenza Unfortunately at day 4 its too late to get the antiviral flu treatment On the plus side if this is a case of the flu the fever should go away over the next 24 hours or so If your fever continues beyond the 4th day you should seek medical attention as soon as possible as this could be a sign of something serious going on To your question The maximum daily dose of as set by the US Food and Drug Administration FDA is 1200mg per day You will have to check the label of your bottle to see how many milligrams of ibuprofen are contained in each gelcap youre taking Divide 1200mg by the amount in one capsule to find how many gelcaps you generally can safely take per day You need to be careful not to take any other cough and cold preparations that also contain ibuprofen Even some branded Tylenol products may contain other active ingredients like ibuprofen so read the labels carefully Meanwhile be sure to drink plenty of fluids I hope you feel better soon But if you dont be sure to seek medical attention Xanax is part of a class of drugs known as Benzodiazepines and is prescribed for anxiety and panic disorders You may have heard the terms SSRI selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or GABA gamma amino butyric acid  Xanax changes brain function by altering GABA production in the brain at the receptor sites which alters the persons mood When used appropriately Xanax is very effective Studies have shown that longterm Xanax use can lead to dependence and addiction Quitting Xanax use cold turkey can be dangerous because the nature of the drugs slows GABA Gamma Amino Butyric Acid production and changes brain chemistry Suddenly stopping Xanax use can be too much for the brain to adjust to can result in serious side effects including horrifying nightmares delusions seizures and death Gallus Detox Center is a private inpatient detox facility that specializes in IV therapy medical detox If you have questions about our facility or detox method please call us at 8553386929 No Ive never had that problem What about hydrohydrosis The flu is a contagious viral illness that can cause high fevers cough runny nose and body aches If you have a high fever you can sweat with it The flu usually lasts from a few days up to two weeks If your symptoms continue for more than 3 days or your immune system is suppressed or you are over 65 it is important to see your doctor to make sure you dont have anything else with the flu Yes absolutely Too much seems to add anxiety I had mine lowered to 75 mg and feel 100 better Also becareful what u take with the effexor In this case less is more The reason that you are having skin burn when you sweat is because there are fats and toxins in your body that is not needed so when you workout you sweat and that is when your body gets rid of the fats that your body does not need which can cause obesity and death Your skin is burning so that it can get rid of the toxins in your body that can make you sick so be sure to take a good shower And also make sure that your hair is properly washed If it is not then the toxins in the sweat can damage your scalp and form hair dandruff If you mean dry mouth as in when you wake up then you are likely just snoring but otherwise yes there are many medications that cause both of these symptoms I recommend you talk to your doctor about any medication you are taking and whether they are the cause and what you can changedo to fix it That sounds like you may have a liver problem with the exception of getting hungry again which may just be in your head no offense I very highly recommend talking to your doctor asap I have this problem on occasion even though I dont have low blood sugar normally I suggest you eat a piece of candy that isnt sugar free or maybe just grab a soda or some sweet tea and drink that and see if the sensation doesnt go away fairly quickly It could have been caused by dehydration from being in the sun I used to get extremely bad cramps in my leg and it hurt so bad I was holding my breath when it happened I went to the doctor and they found that I had low potassium which can cause muscle cramps however blood clots in the leg can also cause extreme pain Might be a good idea to visit your doctor and get it sorted My son had problems with his lymph nodes swelling and after the fear of lymphoma we found out that the cause was infection Hopefully your outcome will be something easy to fix AbsolutelyI take meds for RA which raise my BP along with BP meds which make it important to check my BP daily If it gets too high I contact my doctor to discuss other options including different types of excersise Furthermore I also check my pulse rate at the same time to be sure it does not go too high Possibly stress related I would take NO chances I would go to your family doctor and ask them to see possibly a cardiologist Better to be safe than sorry Good luck Sweating problems are common in FM because of the autonomic nerve dysfunction The sweat glands receive nerve supply from specific autonomic nerves called sympathetic sudomotor nerves Sweating regulates our body temperature called thermoregulation In FM dysutonomia is present and causes too much sweating usually but sometimes the opposite occurs and our skin can be too dry Throw in the usual suspects that overstimulate our autonomics weather changes heat sunlight certain meds esp SSRIs  SNRIs position changes ie laying down stress exercise attempts etc and we become bona fide sweating machines Treatments for excessive sweating are limited I advise my patients to avoid aggravating factors if they can use antiperspirants not deodorants and sometimes an anticholinergic medicine can be tried Work with your doc The flow issues you report are actually quite common and believe it or not in general have little to do with our estrogen levels going down Actually the first thing that happens to many women is that we stop ovulating real well and we stop making progesterone very well progesterone is the hormone our ovaries make after we ovulate I describe progesterone to my patients as the policeman of the lining of the uterus  estrogen causes the lining of the uterus to grow and without police action you can get some very crazy bleeding patterns  too frequent not coming regularly and very heavy flow when they do come One of the ways we actually can manage the crazy flow is with progesterone Often gynecologists will suggest to our patients that we give them 12 days or so of progesterone every two or three monthsif they havent had a period That will cause the lining of the uterus to think you have ovulated when you stop taking the progesterone the uterus will say time for a clean out  but since youve taken the progesterone you should have a reasonably controlled bleed Another way we often deal with these issues in nonsmokers are lowdose birth control pills  especially if one is having hot flashes etc and crazy periods Now the kicker here is I dont know what to make of your chest pain Chest pains can be related to menopause however women do start experiencing more true cardiac issues around the time of menopause So I would check in with your primary care medical doc who may even suggest you check in with a cardiologist  presuming they do rule out heart disease then you can proceed on the attack the menopause front Again help should be available for all of your problems Not sweating when or where you should is called anhidrosis Its generally rare but in certain situations can be serious Anhidrosis can occur in isolated spots on the skin or all over An affected person may notice the lack of sweating or may not be able to tolerate heat outdoors Besides having dry skin that should be moist symptoms can include dizziness muscle cramps and flushing Normal areas of skin may sweat excessively to try to compensate for the nonsweating skin Causes of anhidrosis include Drug side effects oxybutinin topiramate amitriptyline and others Dehydration Skin damage Nerve damage Genetic conditions Anhidrosis increases the risk for heatstroke which can be lifethreatening People with anhidrosis should take extra precautions to limit heat exposure I am not able to tell what might be going on particularly since youve had quite a few tests in the past Your condition is too complicated to figure out without the benefit of examining you You need a doctor to examine you and I would be concerned particularly about the shortness of breath and paintightness That is not something you should ignore I assume when you had your heart checked it was because of these same types of symptoms However they should still not be ignored and you should give your doctor a call Hopefully you have already done so but if not you need to call your doctor right now or call 911 You should not ignore chest pain This needs attention right away Jock itch is a possibility However

evaluation by a medical professional Regards Red Lawhern PhD It is due to as we sweat the body eliminates waste in the form of sweat so thats is the reason behind sour smell of sweat This is all new and not very fun Trying to find out all I can DrySol is aluminum chlorhydrate  the same chemical that is antiperspirants  just in a stronger concentration Hyderhidrosis can be treated with Botox or even surgery but it is very expensive and many insurance companies refuse to cover ti That would not be likely Hepatitis C is spread by blood Here is more information httpwwwwebmdcomhepatitishepcguidehepatitiscprotectingothers There can be many causes for itchy skin but one common cause that can occur in those areas would be atopic dermatitis eczema Experts say that atopic dermatitis is not a rash that itches but rather an itch that rashes so itching is the primary symptom Of course when these areas itch you will scratch This can create an itchscratch cycle that can only be broken by 1 take an antihistamine like Claritin or Zyrtec to control the itching 2 reduce the inflammation by using hydrocortisone cream and finally 3 do your best not to scratch especially to the point where you may break the skin This will set the stage for a secondary infection and make things worse How did it happen Depending on the strain of Staph MRSA it may have been hospitalacquired There are also communityacquired strains but based on your posting of multiple antibiotics and a rarely used one I suspect that she had a hospitalacquired MRSA There is a great medication that you can try but it requires a prescription It is called DrySol aluminum chlorhydrate I have used it with great success with many of my hyperhidrosis patients They are also doing surgical procedures for this odd affliction now and using Botox You can find information about this by an Internet search for Hyperhidrosis surgery This surgery is expensive so having your insurance pay for it may be futile DrySol is cheaper and safer See an ENTthat would be your next step Some tonsil remnants can regenerate over time if all tissue was not removed when you were two especially when you are sick now tonsils are really lymph tissue You are treating a fever incorrectly First fever is harmless and does not need to be treated Second you dont ever use rubbing alcohol sponge baths since this does tend to raise the temperture when the thermal sensors on the skin send signals to the brain the this child is cold This causes shivering and shivering raises body temperature You also do not wrap up a child to sweat it out As a matter of fact sweating allows the body to naturally cool when air is passed over it This is not a very high fever at all If you want to give her some acetaminophen or ibuprofen then this is fine Keep her well hydrated and out of those baths Most febrile events in children are caused by simple viral infections so you can certainly see her regular medical provider if you are concerned Going to the ER would not likely be indicated You cannot be blindly diagnosed over the Internet based solely on a list of vague symptoms If you want to find out what is wrong with you you will need to see a medical provider so that you can be properly examined Your blood pressure is not in control as you know Taking your blood pressure readings every day at least twice would provider your doctor with helpful information since it appears that you will need an adjustment in your medication regime Adjusting medications is very common so this is done in most people In addition to taking your blood pressures at home make sure to reduce your salt intake and if you are overweight try to reduce your weight By achieving an ideal weight and walking more exercise this will greatly improve the effectiveness of your blood pressure management A person cannot be accurately diagnosed by symptoms alone You will need to have a medical examination It has been a of annoyance so I would suggest that you do something about it See your doctor or a dermatologist but this problem can be effectively treated You may have tinea curis a fungal infection perhaps secondarily infected from your scratching This is just a guess however since I cant SEE it Depends on the diseasemany types of bacteria and viruses will be transmitted on fomites objects like clothing that is contaminated I am not sure why you would want to wear anyones sweaty stinky clothes You definitely want an antiperspirant not just a deodorant Ask your doctor about using DrySol  a prescription aluminum chlorhydrate antiperspirant used for people who excessively sweat hyperhidrosis It may help Atenolol is a blood pressure medication that has been used for some anxiety issues If this seems to help him in these social situations then I do think it justifies using it I dont believe he will experience any adverse effects from taking this low dose There are other medications that may be more helpful if this does not work I dont think this natural body response is preventableby medications or any other activity Sweating is totally controlled by the brain It is what it is Since you cannot just stay outside in the cold you may have to deal with this very unique albeit embarrassing response Your wife is correct That is a very high blood pressure and needs to be treated Only a fool would refuse so dont be a fool Only if the oil of the plant is still on the skin The drainage and weeping associated with poison ivy is NOT contagious and will not cause a spread to other areas If the skin eruptions seems to be spreading it was from the original exposure to the plant oila large amount of oil will cause the first skin eruption about a smaller amount of oil from clothing etc may cause a rash to appear a few days later This delay in skin eruptions is wrongly attributed to it being spread by the disease itself but it was caused by the amount of oil on the skin at the time of exposure Yes there is a topical prescription medication called DrySol that you can use on the sweaty areas This is a potent antiperspirant See your medical provider Yes Xanax can help anxiety your reaction to stress assuming this is what is causing your symptoms but it will not help the underlying causes of stress It would take a visual examination by a medical provider to determine the exact nature of your scrotal red blotcha brief description just doesnt do it You may be correct about fungus  common pathogen in this moist area would be a condition called tinea cruris Tinea cruris typically itches however but it can be very red moist and irritated Another possibility would be contact dermatitis often from a fabric softener detergent or soap No young man really wants to go to a medical provider to get his scrotum examined but this is really the only way to be properly diagnosed and treated Ebola is transmitted by body fluids such as blood mucous and perhaps even sweat by a person who actually Ebola A zillion medical and nonmedical conditions can cause a simple fever so the presence of fever does not mean that a you have Ebola or b that you are contagious I have no idea

nature They are formed when the pore fills with dead skin cells white blood cells oil and bacteria giving rise to pus filled boil like appearance A cyst goes into the skin and can be extremely painful It can occur anywhere in the body especially on chest back shoulders and arms I used every thing that my Dermatologist suggested me for but nothing worked Then one day my friend suggested me to go for Accutane I was little worried but there was nothing to lose like situation for me I serched for the same and ordered it from some online pharmacy Now i can really say it worked for me in great way If you are also going with the same problem you can use it as wellYou can buy the medicine and many other similar medicine at drugsdropship24 Could be signs of high and low blood sugars poor circulation and possibly hypertension You need to find a good doctor who will run the appropriate test and even get a CBC count to see exactly whats going on So many possibilities I would have to say blood

definitely need to lose some weight any idea how this affects me and causes me dizynessbtw i dont eat breakfast Also how does heat affect the whole motion sickness thing Also i do sweat incredibly easy if i move a for some time if i work for a long time then i am like a waterfall Thus why i hate anykind of exercise really Hi   I am also 32 yrs old I have been suffering with depression and Anxietyattacks for about 14 years I have always been the person that sits in the back of a crowd not wanting to socialize I would rather have someone approach to say hi I can never get the courage to do it on my own I find that it really helps to have a friend or someone that you know next to you Thats probably hard in meetings I would suggest to try and put all of your thoughts in whats happening in the meeting If you have to listen to someone talking concentrate only on that person and what they are saying That is what I did in class I tried to make it feel like I was the only one in there and the teacher co worker boss or whatever was only talking to me I really hope that some of this advise works I wish you the best   Is it possible that your base temperature in lower than average In my family my mother my daughter and I all have a base body temperature of 968 I discovered mine when I was trying to get pregnant and taking my temperature to see when I was ovulating If that is the case every time you are in the ER or doctors office you have to remind them of that When the themometer shows that we have a temperature of 100 it is that same as 102 in an average person  I sweated so severely from methadone I could care less what anyone thought It was so bad it was destroying my life After much searching including trying to get off the stuff I finally found a Dr who gives me Botox injections in the head and now the sweating is bearable which is a godsend for me  Excessive sweating also called hyperhidrosis means that you sweat far more than your body needs you to sweat For example if you sweat while sitting calmly at your desk that is excessive sweating In hyperhidrosis the bodys cooling mechanism is so overactive that it produces four or five times the amount of sweat that you need About 3 of the population has excessive sweating Because people have different sweat needs doctors say they cant put a solid number on the question how much sweat does it take to be diagnosed with excessive sweating A variety of other factors can cause excessive sweating including underlying medical conditions and medicines for instance Freys syndrome is a condition in which sweating occurs from just one side of the face when certain foods are eaten It occurs after surgery on or injury near the salivaproducing glands Medications taken for endocrine problems diabetes and thyroid disease can also trigger excessive sweating So can certain high blood pressure medicines as well as some antidepressant medications In addition heavy sweating can be caused by infections certain cancers heart or lung disease menopause and sometimes even a stroke I would recommend talking to a doctor It is possible for her to get pregnant that way in fact it will take a little time for the semen to get to her uterus so she may have her period once or twice until she does become pregnant The fact that she is still a virgin will cause her even more pain when the baby is born so to save her the pain i suggest you take her virginity They can not preform an abortion if she is still a virgin But i hope you two decide to keep it Do you have anxiety Could be from anxiety or depressmentl There is a pill called fluoxetine and it helps most of all of those symptoms thank you very much for your input i have determined that it is jock itch and am getting a corticosteroid and some fungal cream as well He meant it literally He had blood stains on his white tshirt where he usually has sweat stains I have heard of them growing back Sounds like you have diabetes It can cause

you have mentioned The sooner the better You can control it But there is no cure Radiating heat around the sting sights as well as reddening and swelling is normal for the amount of stings and being from a wasp As a fact you can have the same problems with just one sting However you are doing the right things medically as you can May take 3 days to a week for the heat and swelling to subside was on klonopin for 4 years 2 milligramlast week they switched me to xanax not sure its working yet This could be thrush A yeast infection You need to see your Dr This is easily treated with medication however the root cause of this infection needs to be discovered This infection could indicate other medical problems ask about alprazolam 025 mg oral tabs I swear Ive told my fiance mom that even my darned toes to my hair sweat Sheesh AM I glad you know what I mean that I am not the ONLY 1 I am 55 KNOW that I am in menopause which also means MENNOPAWS so I guess you know how MY sig other feels

then colder than a fridge Ask the ole man hes been patiently waiting Ive seriously thought about bringing him SOMEwhere like to a cousin or the like Sex is the LAST thing I wantneedcare for  honestly I used to love it Anyhow I have heard that diabetic types of conditions can be a cause Also which floored me COPD Our bodies are always changing along wmetabolism  mine just isnt there any longer Dont count out the hot flashes there are all typesso Ive heard Excuse the jabs up there I am my own worst enemy It could be a number of things But Low blood sugar could cause thisif you have hypoglycemia you may need something to eat I am not overweight I weigh 125 I am getting overheated regularly while exercising and sweating profusely Get tested go see your doctor could be generalized anxiety or vertigo or you could be dehydrated abnormal blood pressure can also present this way I could go on these type symptons can be indicators of many things see a physician get a check up and get some blood drawn I believe that what is going on is called premental pausally syndrome It can be caused by many things I had vertigo from a medication I was on once The ER doctor asked me if the room felt like it was spinning or did I feel like I was spinning He explained that usually if the cause is from the neck up inner ear ear infection etc you will feel like the room is spinning and if the cause is from the below the neck such as cardiac issues you feel like youre spinning Some of your symptoms are also those of diabetes If the room is spinning you can take Meclizine OTC check with a pharmacist if you are taking other medications If the problem is inner ear or an ear infection this should help your symptoms If it doesnt help or your symptoms get worse you should probably see a doctor to rule out more serious conditions I do know the top number is how fast the blood is going into your heart and the bottom number is the pressure on your heart between beats I was on bp meds because my bottom number got so high Have you ever had your blood sugar checked You may be hypoglycemic i too developed extreme sweating in my late twenties through my research ive been told i have hyperhydrosis altho that usually includes sweating in the hands and armpits i however am like you i sweat from my head face and its just awful i noticed it after taking a prescription anti deodorant for armpits it seems that it blocked off my sweat being produced in my underarms and now goes straight to my head if u find any other info please post it is a difficult thing to deal with and rather embarrassing at times See your primary care physician heshe may need to refer you to a specialist for colon testing My husband had severe sleep apnea and developed carbon monoxide poisoning from low oxygen in blood Need to get blood oxygen level checked Very important if you sweating profusely with muscle cramp dizziness and either shallow or trouble breathing yes it is heat exhaustion yes that is a very normal symptoms The best thing that you have to do is to follow your doctor Things may go out fine after some time You may also check out httpwwwclearcliniccom for the best in skin care First are you a female If so how old It may be menopause And they do have medication for that You might also want to check and see if you are border line diabetic People who have diabeties can have night sweats it means he is low on oxygen and he should probably go to the ER even if he doesnt want to I have also experienced this I dont drink much water Do you if not i suggest when you feel that way drink a few glasses of water and see how you feel a few hours later It helps me When dehydrated you will feelHot flashes headaches feels like you might pass out but dont almost like your brain clicks off for a second its a weird feeling kinda hard to explain you will sweat at night too Drink more water plan and simple Have you checked your blood sugars at the time you feel shakey sweaty etc A normal person blood sugars levels is between 6099 before eating according to my doctor Also what are your levels 12 hours after you eat go to the doctors and see what they have to say  maybe its the gloves If you were not feeling panicked or overwhelmed at the time of the episode it may not be a panic attack and you may want to talk with your doctor a panic attack doesnt always have to be paralyzing there are different levels of panic attacks whatever is causing your spells I hope that you get better well you could always have the doctor do a basic blood test to rule out infection because your white blood count would tell if infection is present  also 55 is a pretty normal age for the change of life  have you seen your gyn i think thats a good thing to bring up her  she can help rule out what it is and if it is the change of life she can help you try things to make it less of a problem in your everyday life hope this helped  well i have had the night sweats due to my esophagitis gastritis hiatal hernia and fundic intosusception  which are all stomach problems along with that i was having pains in my stomach  not able to eat  stress was a big factor in my life when i found out i noticed when i was able to get my stress levels down the problems were better under control i also had tried a few meds  question are you eatting enough and remember that lightheadness can constipation all can be cause by lack of water  and try to eat softer foods try to up take you intake of water  and i think it very important to somehow find a way to reduce your stress level  im normally 110 lbs with stress and all these problems i went down to 89lbs  also if nothing seems to help i would ask my doctor for an egd  on your upper and lower gi tracks to see just what going on  so call your doctor and get down to the bottem of it  i hope you feel better i know just how horrible it can be fever is sign of infection the shivers is a sign of your baby trying to fright the infection sweating is caused by your baby trying to make his or body temp go down  headaches are cause by the fever either way if its flu or something else any higher of a fever can fry the brain and led to brain damage  go to the hospital asap  yeast is inside your intestines its the stuff thathelps break down our food  but it is possible that sweating has cause some yeast to enter your vag area  i would say drink plenty of water to help it flush out and try to keep yourself extra clean to avoid it repeating  Also The recent symptons are I stay healthy I run bike and eat healthy I cant even go running or biking anymore without almost collapsing I live in Phoenix The longer I run or bike the colder my body becomes I mean like ice cold Other people have felt my body coming in doors after

control pillafter 30yrs im now 50i stopped them mth agoi have racing heart sweating fatiguefeeling downis this all because my estrogen levels are low through stopping pillplus if i wasnt on pill my age 50i wouldnt have much estogen leftso is this why my symptoms badHELPPPPPPPPP PLZZ Im not familiar with COPD but I do know that an increased heart rate causes night sweats I had them for years turned out eating right before I slept was increasing my heart rate even just that subtly it caused me to think I was having early menopause lol Not usually but the after effects do If youre experiencing a sort of negative excitement feeling in your chest like the feeling we get if we hear a big bang and are anticipating a dramatic scene occurring THAT feeling in your chest with shortness of breath but not as dramatic as a full blown attack close enough though then its just considered anxiety Thanks Actually I had some bloodwork done and my Vitamin D level was very low 7 I was put on 50000 iu of a prescription vitamin d for 8 wks 1 a wk Its been 9 weeks tomorrow and now Im taking over the counter vitamin d am going back to dr next week to have blood checked again I felt better after the first 2 wks not dizzy not tired no more headaches Then again I began feeling dizzy lightheaded alot and tired no energyI dont know whats going on but Ill hopefully find out  I was having headaches night sweats hot flashes and fatigue I am currently being treated with bioidentical hormone pellets No more hot flahes or night sweats feel 100 times better I do get a few headaches about twice a year but nothing like before My gynecologist started the therapy and told me about it They do bloodwork to check your hormone levels and make the pellets special for your body You probably have hemmoroids I had them and required surgery to have them removed after alternative therapy didnt work creams You need to discuss with your primary physician and he will probably refer you to an general lapro doctor Hope this helps I am not sure I also have been having severe night sweats body feeling hot then chilled flushing in the facial area and neck I spoke w my doctors they cannot seem to figure it out Could be possibly meds you are taking anxiety and stress infection of some kind That is what was told to me I was given a blood test to check my thyroid everything OK You might want to get your thyroid checked through a blood test I hope that this helps in anyway I know what you are going through Yes those symptoms may not be coincidental However you might need to wait a little longer to see if you are HIV positive Test results may be incorrect if youre tested too soon They have a test where they prick your finger just like a diabetes test Its completely painless and it takes 15 minutes They test for HIV antibodies and thats why you might need to wait a little longer to test If you have an outreach center near you they offer tests for free Also was the rash white Thats a common thing for HIV Flu symptoms are a common indicator Its certainly possible The best way is to see if that person you had an interaction with 100 is infected Bring himher to a test center Even if its negative heshe could still be a carrier Its scary but you can definitely get it under control If you feel extremely off and in danger visit the ER just in case its something else Hi there Id say wear loose clothing and nonconstricting undies that allow airflow Also a good thing to use would be baby powder The powder can absorb excess moisture as well as help with the smell Also be sure to wipe with baby wipes after going number 2 just so the sweat smell doesnt mix in to that type of smell Wash your body every day thank you so much we had found out that my dad has it and he was so worried becouse iv been giving him a kiss on the forehead b4 i leave him and he has been sweating off and on thanks again not so worriedwolf That can happen if youre eating a highprotein diet dehydration may be some of the problem "}
