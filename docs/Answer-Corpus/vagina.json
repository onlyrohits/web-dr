herpes has an outbreak sores will appear in their genital area including around the anus these sores will often cause extreme pain or discomfort especially when urinating Next time the sores appear have a doctor test them for the STD or you can get a blood test which might offer a more difinitive answer Do you practice any kind of hair removal in the area If so an ingrown hair may have caused the formation of a cyst Have the doctor do a blood check for herpes Sounds like it could be a yeast infection There are now creams available over the counter to treat that  Your posting appears to be inappropriate for WebMD Answers I dont need to see any pictures The obvious reactions that you were attempting to achieve by inserting sexually crude content failed I am neither shocked nor angry I am disappointed What you describes sounds like it may be the labia minora Most often they are described as flat and reddish folds in women that have had children these structures can extend beyond the outer labia  cause no reason to be concerned However since this is something that youve recently noticed  you describe as being dark or black in color Id recommend that you see your gynecologist and get it evaluated A simple vaginal exam is all that is needed to confirm this is the labia minora and nothing more serious If she does it will be a miracle The sperm has to literally travel pretty far to get INTO her to attach to one of her eggs Go for a complete check up is she really infertile or not If she is unable to conceive then she need to adapt Clomild or Clomiphene as it will stimulate your hormones which will help in ovulation Clomid is usually used to treat infertility in women It will help you to regulate your ovulation and stimulate the development of multiple eggs for use with assisted reproduction technology like IVF It elevates a womans FSH level to the normal And after such things it make a woman fertile or able to give birth to a healthy child So you can really opt for Clomid and if you want to start it early you may order it from online pharmacies like Meds247online to get at your doorstep Yes the warts can For your any dental problem click here  confidentdentalcare Your urinary incontinence and overactive bladder symptoms may worsen during pregnancy You need to speak with you obstetrician and tell him about your incontinence as they may consider delivering your baby a different way Also you need to start Kegels or pelvic floor muscle exercises so that your pelvic muscle can support your bladder and your uterus as your baby grows It is great if your wifegf has masterbated in the past and has orgasms Sometimes us guys need to listen to the women Have her show you and tell you how she can achieve an orgasm The underside of of the clit is the most sensitive area for most women Soft but firm rubbingmassaging of this area has produced an orgasm in every woman I have tried it on And yes foreplay for women is very important Take your time and enjoy the wonderful experience If you are not into the normal sex lubricants some natural products like coconut oil or almond oil works very well Orgasms will happen if you try different thingsways Each woman is a little bit different in this area Do what ever works for you I am having the same problem right now and trying to get answers None of them seem to have any of the answers I want to know if you can have irregular periods if you are having sex I dont know but I think its worth checking out It may be something simple like a clogged pore but then again it could be a symptom of something else Because its a new symptom and not something you expect in a fiveyearold it definitely warrants an appointment with your pediatrician I wouldnt worry too much about this Just make an appointment and get this checked when you can Wishing you the best Id recommend you get this checked by a doctor Several things can cause the symptoms youre describing from a yeast infection to a sexually transmitted disease Its very important you get an accurate diagnosis in order to receive the correct treatment for the problem Some itching in the vaginal area is normal The rash you described isnt normal nor is the cut or the extreme burning while taking a bath While this is not an emergency situation I hope youre able to see a doctor soon to find out whats going on Meanwhile I would urge you to avoid having sex just in case you do have a sexually transmitted disease such as or  You do not want to give your partner a disease I wish you all the best The short answer is no but theres more to it than that Vagisil is an overthecounter product designed to treat some of the symptoms of a yeast infection including itching However Vagisil does not contain medication to treat the yeast infection itself For that you first need an accurate diagnosis from a doctor Second you need a medication such as miconazole cream are a whole other story Genital warts are a sexually transmitted disease If you believe you have vaginal warts you need to avoid having sex even with a condom and see a doctor as soon as possible to determine if you have been infected with human papillomavirus HPV I hope you can see a health care provider soon to get a diagnosis and treatment if necessary Best wishes to you Great question Youre smart to think about the medications youre putting into your body if you may be pregnant Metronidazole oral is not recommended for use during the first trimester of pregnancy However if youre taking the medication to treat bacterial vaginosis be aware that BV also can be harmful to a developing baby Id suggest you call a pharmacist to get an opinion about whether to continue this medication over the weekend As soon as possible on Monday call your health care providers office and explain the situation He or she will tell you what to do So to sum up Dont panic Get a professional opinion from a pharmacist now then call your doctor as soon as you can Best wishes to you I think what youre asking is Can you transmit genital to your partner if you have oral herpes but you do not perform oral sex on her And the answer to that is no You also cant give her oral herpes if you dont kiss her Herpes is transmitted by direct contact I applaud your concern about not transmitting herpes to your partner However what concerns me more here is the issue of safe sex in general How do you know SHE doesnt have genital herpes that may be transmitted to YOU She could have genital herpes and not even know it Or she could be infected with HPV and not know it In fact she could have several sexually transmitted diseases and be unaware of it Why would take chances with reproductive health by not practicing safe sex at all times Plus of course theres the issue of pregnancy Do you want to become a father Are you ready to become a dad Because its possible if youre having unprotected sex No method of birth control is 100 effective but you can increase the effectiveness of any birth control by using redundant systems to borrow a term from computer science In other words even if your partner is using some form of birth control you can also use a form of birth control in this case a  to make sex even safer in terms of pregnancy prevention Again I think youre very wise to be aware that you have oral herpes and to be concerned about not transmitting this virus I hope you think about the other issues I brought up too Im sorry youre dealing with this but its a good thing you noticed You need to get these pimples checked out right away Lesions in the vagina in the area of the vulva or around the anus can be signs of a sexually transmitted disease such as or  If you have one of these conditions its imperative you know it so you can get appropriate treatment and understand what you need to do to protect your sex partners These STDs are easily transmitted Until youve had these pimples diagnosed you must avoid having sex of any kind oral vaginal anal Of course its possible the pimples youre describing are not any kind of STD This is why you need to see a health care provider to receive a diagnosis Please remember to always practice safe sex by using a condom A properly used condom will not protect against the transmission of all sexually transmitted diseases but its a good start Take care I sense your frustration  and empathize with it As women age they need to reassess which screenings are appropriate and which are not Youre clearly in reassessment mode Only you can decide whether or not to continue having pelvic exams All individuals have the right to refuse treatment at any time I am not advocating that you do so however A pelvic exam covers more than simply evaluating the vagina During a pelvic exam your health care provider can gain valuable information about other abdominal structures such as your bladder and colon Conditions like and a notuncommon complication that can occur years after a hysterectomy often are first discovered during a routine pelvic examination You may be thinking For heavens sake I think Id know it if I had a prolapsed bladder To which I would reply You might be surprised how many women live with a prolapsed bladder for a long time before theyre aware of it Also I would point out your question is not simply yes or no For example you and your health care provider could agree for you to have a pelvic exam only everyother year Or every five years Or whatever you and your provider are comfortable with If your provider is doing a Pap smear of your vaginal tissue during these exams its worth noting the research doesnt support doing this Vaginal cancers are extremely rare while performing unnecessary Pap smears add to the overall cost of health care delivery If you had a hysterectomy due to cervical or uterine cancer thats a different story Again every woman has individual needs and should take her family health history into consideration before deciding what exams and screenings make sense as she ages Wishing you well I would suggest you consult your OBGYN as soon as possible about this There may be nothing at all wrong but you do want someone to take a peek in there to make sure everything looks normal An appointment with your OBGYN also would be a good opportunity to discuss whether you should continue having  given this symptom Wishing you and your baby all the best Im sorry to hear youre going through this and experiencing such anxiety Id suggest you make a phone call to get an appointment with a gynecologist as soon as possible to set your mind at ease Many conditions can cause the symptoms you describe from a vaginal yeast infection to a urinary tract infection to a sexually transmitted disease The only way to diagnose this properly is through a physical exam by a medical professional What youre describing does not sound like a medical emergency so please do not run to the emergency room Just get an appointment with your gynecologist or with a womens health center as soon as you can Best wishes to you Sorry to hear about the breakup Thats always rough Well if the girl who performed oral sex on you did not have any active cold sores   and you used a condom for the vaginal sex then the risks of your getting an STD from this encounter are relatively low The risk is never nonexistent because a condom may not cover all skin areas that could contact an area infected with  for example But in general it sounds like your risk is pretty low The only way to know for sure is to ask your partner if she has any known STDs Awkward right But you know you could approach it from the standpoint of hey I know we were both a little drunk and I just wanted to assure you I dont have any STDs that you might have picked up She likely will respond kindly to your reaching out and may offer the same information in return By the way kudos for remembering the condom after drinking too much Im sorry to hear youre going through this Heres the thing This could be some sort of blemish like a clogged pore but that pimple also could be the  Even if youve never had unprotected sex you should see a gynecologist while that pimple is active so that he or she can diagnose the problem Id suggest calling to make an appointment as soon as possible Meanwhile you should avoid having sex even with a condom Condoms may not fully protect your partner against certain STDs such as  Best of luck to you This is an interesting question A blood test is not how yeast infection is diagnosed Normally a vaginal swab is taken and tested Sometimes health care providers diagnose a yeast infection simply based on history recently took antibiotics with a verbal report of symptoms now I have a vaginal discharge with itching A urine test also would not detect a vaginal yeast infection Thus Id recommend you return to your health care provider for an examination Genital blisters are not a normal feature of a yeast infection but they can be a sign of a sexually transmitted disease You deserve to find out exactly whats going on down there Wishing you all the best Im sorry youre experiencing this Unfortunately the only way to diagnose whats going on is through a physical examination Many things could cause the bump youre describing such as a small cyst Only a medical professional can tell you whats going on The key points here are You have a bump where there shouldnt be one and its uncomfortable Those two facts alone warrant a trip to the doctor This isnt an emergency but why not go see your gynecologist to get this diagnosed and treated if necessary Best wishes to you Well I dont know But I am sorry youre going through this The only way to discover what these mystery lesions are is through a physical examination by a medical professional Several conditions could cause the blisters you describe and some of those conditions are more serious than others I recommend you see a doctor as soon as possible to get this diagnosed and treated Meanwhile please avoid having sex even with a condom Because you describe lesions that cover a fairly broad area a condom may not protect your partner from contacting one of these blisters In the event this is some kind of  you dont want to risk infecting anyone else I hope youre able to get this treated promptly Feel better soon The only thing you really need to do is shower And you dont even need to overdo the shower Just apply some soapy water and rinse thoroughly Its highly unlikely you would get any sort of infectious disease from a cat urinating on you Maybe if you ingested the urine or something but not from simply getting it on your skin Its not even likely youd catch something if the urine contacted your vulva So take a deep breath and jump in the shower Youll be fine Wishing you well yeast infection for sure Yeast infections can also come with discolored discharge and a foul odor Bacterial infections can also cause this Talk to your OBGYN they can take a urine culture and do an exam to make sure it isnt anything more serious than the mentioned above They will give you antibiotics for yeast or bacterial infections You dont have to have intercourse to get either They can both be caused by many things For examle scented body washes scented tampons wiping back to front and many other things Hope this helps I have also had this problem before I asked my OBGYN and she said that it is normal It is a chemical that is in discharge that acts as a bleach It is most likely to happen right before your period or during ovulation I just had a cyst on my ovary burst What should be done now It could be bacterial vaginosis which is not sexually transmitted Hi I can relate been there myself If you can go to a DO OBGYN and ask about hormone therapy It is bioidentical these days and very safe It really really helped me Best to you I know it is so strange and makes you feel old when you really arent Old is a state of mind   That response was appreciated The home remedies are something worth considering However Im hoping that a medical expert can answer the initial question Sincerely thank you for your input though A friend of mine has four children and all of them have had variations of this problemcant feel the urge to pee pees in pants needs stool softener All of her children were diagnosed with vesicoureteral reflux to some degree or another The oldest child had surgery to correct this when she was 4 yrs old but none of the other children required surgery Have you had your daughters kidney function tested Hopefully it is nothing serious but kidney problems are nothing to fool around with and catching kidney problems early is key to prevent permanent kidney damage Please see a urologist ASAP I feel terrible for your poor girl and hope youshe get answers soon From a male who has traveled to Asia Asian women in the bedroom Excel  Far Far superior to American women Asian women for 2 thousand years have practiced abdominal exercises that are meant to please the man keep the man American women who have traveled to Asia have picked up on this done Keigel exercises lower abdominal exercises love the results Better control sexually better control in birthing post pregnancy husbands love these women For overall health the abdominal muscles provide the gateway for better endurancesexuality overall health love making in all aspects Try doing the Keigel exercises lower stomach muscles you will find the hard work worth every effort  Our ancestors worked hard  were in great shape not fat had great stomach muscles And funny thingdivorce rate was very low Go for it Two ultrasound studies of women who exercised their vaginal muscles did find that their muscles were thicker and stronger after pelvic floor muscle training Among women with urine leakage their thinner muscles became the thickness of healthy womens pelvic floor muscles Additionally they had less urine leakage  whether the problem was from stress or urge types of incontinence The use of vaginal cones andor Kegel exercises to increase muscle strength were both found to improve tone and decrease urine loss While some of these studies did not measure vaginal tightness per se when muscle bulk is increased a woman can voluntarily contract those muscles to make the vaginal opening tighter Despite the fact that most every discussion of Kegel exercises includes improved sex there are not many scientific studies to back up this claim One recent publication reported on sexual function and pelvic muscle factors for some 2800 women Women who delivered only by Caesarean section and their partners perceived they had better vaginal tone leading to improved sexual satisfaction Women who were currently doing pelvic muscle exercises scored much better on sexual satisfaction questions than women who did not Women with incontinence probably thinner muscles scored the worst on the sex questions Many genital plastic surgery techniques are based upon GYN surgical procedures used for medical problems such as reconstruction after cancer treatment gender change repair of cystocelerectocele etc Unfortunately there are few good studies showing benefit where there is no overt medical problem  The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has noted the lack of both safety and effectiveness data for genital plastic surgery The possible complications for such surgery might include infection changes in sensation pain with intercourse and scar tissue One GYN who has been performing genital plastic surgery for a number of years concluded that agreedupon terminology and training standards are still lacking About one in three women leak urine after giving birth This is called stress incontinence and its due to weakened pelvic floor muscles allowing for the neck of the bladder to sag down so that urine can escape with laughing coughing or sneezing Most doctors tell women to do Kegel exercises to strengthen their pelvic floor muscles In some cases surgery is required But studies have also shown that vaginal weights can strengthen the muscles enough to reduce incontinence as well Heres how they work You insert a coneshaped weight into your vagina and then work on squeezing your muscles to keep the weights in place for about 15 minutes once or twice a day You can actually go about your daily business while doing this Once youre able to hold this weight in easily you try a slightly heavier weight They are sold in sets Advocates of the weights believe that its easier for a woman to learn to isolate and train her pelvic floor muscles properly using the weights than it is using just Kegels which are easy to do incorrectly You can get vaginal weights overthecounter online or as a prescription via your health care provider According to a justpublished FDA report 2011 the most common problems reported when mesh was used for repair of prolapse were Erosion or protrusion of the mesh from the soft tissues Pain including pain with intercourse Infections in the area of the mesh Urinary tract problems Bleeding from the mesh site Damage to nearby organs According to one of the largest analyses of almost 12000 women about 10 of women experienced mesh erosion within a year after surgery This figure includes both synthetic mesh and biologic types Abed 2011 Individual studies have found rates that were as low as 12  as in a group of 446 women derived from a private urogynecology clinic Stephanian 2008 Some risk factors have been described which might predispose a woman to have mesh erode into vaginal tissues Among 322 women who had a 24 month follow up after mesh repair for POP having a hysterectomy at the time of POP surgery and being a smoker increased risk for mesh problems Cundiff 2008 When the mesh was placed through a vaginal approach as opposed to an abdominal incision there were more mesh complications Visco 2001 Other risks may include increasing age low estrogen levels size of mesh implant and variations in surgical technique Mistrangelo 2007 Keeping ones uterus and use of a mesh just for rectocele repair seemed to decrease risk Caquant 2008 How long is your normal menstrual cycle In a typical 28 day cycle the most fertile days would be from Day 11 to Day 15 with ovulation occurring approximately on Day 14 The first day of bleeding would NOT be a fertile day and sperm deposited at that time would only live until Day 5 so could not cause a pregnancy Doesnt matter which of those two days you got pregnant Doctors count pregnancy from the first day of your last menstrual period Something has changed Since you were both virgins when you started it could be assumed that you were both free of disease and safe for each other This changes as soon as one partner is unfaithful to the other and creates the potential for diseases to come into the relationship Maybe you should both see a doctor about this You should always use waterbased lubricants and NOT oilbased Could be a sign of Endometriosis or perhaps you were pregnant and had a miscarriage Perhaps you need to use a waterbased lubricant as well Bleeding after exercise and sexual intercourse in absolutely abnormal it may have following reasons hormonal imbalance emotionalphysical stresses  change in diet lifestyle pregnancy or chronic illness The woman produces Squirting Orgasm similar to male ejaculation but doesnt contain the semen the fluid that produced as lubricant and projected out of vagina when she orgasms  yes it can By your history your symptoms fit a diagnosis of a Vaginal Yeast Infection perfectly This can be caused by change in detergent soaps or even the material of your underwear This is something that must be treated and only gets worse with time If you have recently taking antibiotics they can also cause this Talk with your Mother cause my guess is she has experienced this herself Even without the discharge you could have an yeast infection or a numerous of STD Not everyone is going to have discharge as a symptom On the other hand if the pain is only during intercourse it could be due to dryness but highly unlikely with an odor Most importantly seek medical attention Based on your history I would seek medical attention Using Plan B twice could cause irregular bleeding but highly unlikely to cause severe suprapubic pain Since you are on the Nuva ring you should always insert the birth control even after using Plan B If you became pregnant of course your period would not come the following month but its best to stay on schedule with birth control If not you start to miss with your cycle which can cause scares Best thing to do would be take a pregnancy test first then call your OBGYN and have an appointment set up Also Plan B should only be used in emergency cases and is not safe to use every time a mishap comes along Sounds like a possible STD I would say go see your gyno asap This is a picture of it httpi1309photobucketcomalbumss621Kaylamartinez101Mobile20Uploadsimagezps856a0986jpg It probably is a yeast infection but you need to tell your mom so she can get you medical attention She is a woman so she will understand She probably has a yeast infection whihch is common among women She can purchase an over the counter medication or use pure yougart no flavoring by inserting it into her vagina If she waits too long she may have to seek medical attention for a stronger presecription there is no such thing as small vagina or big penis unless it is very extreme a small vagina is one which cant allow the insertion of two fingers try inserting a clean finger into vagina and gradually increase it to two fingers stretch it slightly As a woman goes through perimenopause and into menopause estrogen levels decline leading to thinning of the vaginal tissues as well as the bladder lining and the vulvar skin The opening to the vagina involutes which makes it become smaller and tighter There is a decrease in vaginal secretions and therefore dryness Painful intercourse occurs as well as loss of pleasure when a woman is touched in the clitoral vulvar and vaginal area Many women then will avoid sex due to discomfort The prevalence of vulvovaginal atrophy is about 75 to 90 among postmenopausal women Sounds like something for your pediatrician May be nothing alarming but better safe than sorry besides sounds like your baby is in pain Yes it will make them tighter Thats the exercise my gynecologist told me to do after I had a baby It really worked for me my husband could tell the difference If you dont know how to do them you hold in the muscles that you use if you had to pee for a few seconds then release then hold again You can do them all day at your desk home or driving in your car The more you use these muscles the quicker youll see results Yes it will make them tighter Thats the exercise my gynecologist told me to do after I had a baby It really worked for me my husband could tell the difference If you dont know how to do them you hold in the muscles that you use if you had to pee for a few seconds then release then hold again You can do them all day at your desk home or driving in your car The more you use those muscles the quicker your results i have same problem except i use to get wet before i had a hysterectomy but i have never had an orgasm either and if i did i did not reconize it Vaginal Culdocentesis is a procedure that is rarely used today thanks to the transvaginal ultrasound that is able to detect fluid behind the vagina Although it may still be done to identify pelvic inflammatory disease for a ruptured etopic pregnancy or ovarian cysts The performing Doctor will lift up on the cervix and insert a long thin needle into the vaginal wall under the uterus to take a sample of fluid  If she is on her period it is not very likely there is really only one week of each month you can get pregnant when you ovulate and that is about 2 weeks before your period usually Im not so sure Id jump into saw palmetto at this point There are a couple of reports on its use to reduce prostate size in males and even there the literature isnt definitive  but there is no definitive data on its use in women There are other overthecounter remedies for several of the problems you list If the problem of dryness is vaginal dryness Id go with something like Replens For indigestion issues you could start with something like Tums or if you need something stronger try the acidblocker medications things like OTC Prilosec or Prevacid or Tagamet But Id tend to go with those instead of trying the palmetto Abnormal vaginal bleeding is a flow of blood from the vagina that occurs either at the wrong time during the month or in inappropriate amounts In order to determine whether bleeding is abnormal and its cause the doctor must consider three questions Is the woman pregnant What is the pattern of the bleeding Is she ovulating Every woman who thinks she has an irregular menstrual bleeding pattern should think carefully about the specific characteristics of her vaginal bleeding in order to help her doctor evaluate her particular situation Her doctor will require the details of her menstrual history Each category of menstrual disturbance has a particular list of causes necessary testing and treatment 1 Is the woman having abnormal vaginal bleeding during pregnancy Much of the abnormal vaginal bleeding during pregnancy occurs so early in the pregnancy that the woman doesnt realize she is pregnant Therefore irregular bleeding that is new may be a sign of very early pregnancy even before a woman is aware of her condition Vaginal bleeding during pregnancy can also be associated with complications of pregnancy such as miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy 2 What is the pattern of the abnormal vaginal bleeding The duration interval and amount of vaginal bleeding may suggest what type of abnormality is responsible for the bleeding An abnormal duration of menstrual bleeding can be either bleeding for too long of a period  hypermenorrhea  or too short of a period  hypomenorrhea  The interval of the bleeding can be abnormal in several ways A womans menstrual periods can occur too frequently  polymenorrhea  or too seldom  oligomenorrhea  Additionally the duration can vary excessively from cycle to cycle  metrorrhagia  The amount volume of bleeding can also be abnormal A woman can either have too much bleeding  menorrhagia  or too little volume  hypomenorrhea  The combination of excessive bleeding combined with bleeding outside of the expected time of menstruation is referred to as menometrorrhagia  3 Is the woman ovulating Usually the ovary releases an egg every month in a process called ovulation Normal ovulation is necessary for regular menstrual periods There are certain clues that a woman is ovulating normally including regular menstrual intervals vaginal mucus discharge halfway between menstrual cycles and monthly symptoms including breast tenderness fluid retention menstrual cramps back pain and mood changes If necessary doctors will order hormone blood tests progesterone level daily home body temperature testing or rarely a sampling of the lining of the uterus endometrial sampling to determine whether or not a woman is ovulating normally On the other hand signs that a woman is not ovulating regularly include prolonged bleeding at irregular intervals after not having a menstrual period for several months excessively low blood progesterone levels in the second half of the menstrual cycle and lack of the normal body temperature fluctuation during the time of expected ovulation Sometimes a doctor determines that a woman is not ovulating by using endometrial sampling with biopsy Vaginal bleeding may occur during or after sexual intercourse for a number of reasons including Injuries to the vaginal wall or introitus opening to the vagina during intercourse Infections for example gonorrhea chlamydia yeast infections can be a cause of vaginal bleeding after intercourse Lowered estrogen levels in perimenopausal or postmenopausal women may cause the lining of the vagina to become thinned and easily inflamed or infected and these changes can be associated with vaginal bleeding after intercourse Anatomical lesions such as tumors or polyps on the cervix or vaginal wall may lead to vaginal bleeding during or after intercourse Women who experience vaginal bleeding during or following sexual intercourse should always visit their doctor to determine the cause of the bleeding Vaginal itching and burning can have several different causes Most common are yeast infections and bacterial infections Normal bacteria and yeast are both found in the vagina in a delicate balance Some things including antibiotics diabetes and pregnancy can upset the balance This allows the yeast cells to take over A yeast infection can result causing burning and itching There may also be a thick whitish discharge If you have any of these symptoms you should call your healthcare provider Here is a good article from WebMD on yeast infections httpwomenwebmdcomtcvaginalyeastinfectionstopicoverview Metronidazole Flagyl does not affect your period However if you are taking a birth control pill the antibiotic can affect how well the pill works  meaning if you didnt use another form of birth control it would increase the likelihood of getting pregnant Home pregnancy tests are sensitive enough to detect pregnancy if youre one week late if thats a possibility Just be sure to get a test that says it can detect pregnancy when youre one week late From the description I am not able to tell what the spots may be Your and your boyfriends doctors are likely going to need to take a look to determine whats causing them Its normal but I bet you know by now Its just your uterus wall its skin gets softer once a month when you have your period So it will peel you will have really bad cramps but when it passes you will will better But you have nothing to worry about happens to 3 out of 5 girls Yes indeed You could try soaking it with a hot wash cloth several times to see if it would come out on its own If it gets infected the doctor would put you on antibiotic then with minor OP surgery would remove it Simple procedure Period This will have no impact on your chances of getting pregnant This could be a sign caused by some major birth control options ie the pill depo shots implants nothing to worry about usually it starts back up on the fourth day It can also be spotting the usual cycle that happens before your actual period If its your usual time of the month and youre NOT on birth control see your doctor other possibilities could be infection uteran problems etc Hi Try this site httpwwwmyhomeremediescomstaticyeastinfectionshtml Sea salt is said to be very good its just two handfuls in a bath

that anyone diagnosed with diabetes should avoid high carbohydrate diets Yogurt may provide normal microorganisms for the genitourinary tract so many advocate it as a preventative measure or treatment of yeast infections A few of things I forgot keep out of jeans and slacks same with tights wear just lose cotton knickers go without when you can and shave off your pubic hair this last bit is because

group youve been suffering for a very long time ten years or more It feels like youve tried everything under the sun and youve probably spent hundreds maybe even thousands of dollars on products that just dont work Youve lost a ton of money and sadly a huge chunk of your life Ive seen many patients like this over the years and have built my reputation on turning many of these cases around Its what gets me up in the morning and makes me feel excited to be able to give people the opportunity to achieve amazing results at their own hands with the right information and encouragement If you are in the group of people who hasnt had a diagnosis you probably think Im making this up or at least fluffing up the details a bit The truth though is that Ive spent the past 25 years of my career as a naturopathic physician talking to thousands of people who feel like their lives have been ruined These are just a few of the stories Ive heard I wasnt kidding when I said Ive heard countless stories just like this  from men and women alike When a Candida overgrowth gets to the point where its wreaking havoc with your entire body you may ultimately become so ill and beat that you just cant seem to function Its difficult to work because you constantly feel fuzzy headed  anxious and depressed  sick to your stomach  and sensitive to just about any food  chemical  or toxin you come into contact with Its not just adults who are too sick to build their careers further their educations or have fun with family and friends either A number of the parents Ive worked with have brought their children to see me In some cases I can trace the path of Candida in children all the way back to birth During the birthing process when a baby should be getting nutrients and good bacterial flora from his mother these children contracted yeast instead Instead of growing stronger they remained compromised as their condition worsened with age And when they became unwell what would the doctor prescribe You guessed it more antibiotics These may help as well Good Luck Hi This is from the Uks NHS at The link httpwwwnhsukConditionsvaginaldischargePagesIntroductionaspx Just copy this int google to open

varies throughout your menstrual cycle brown discharge is usually the end of your period and most pregnant women will get a  pregnancy discharge  Healthy discharge does not have a strong smell or colour You may feel an uncomfortable wetness but you should not have any itching or soreness around your vagina Any sudden change to your discharge may indicate a vaginal infection You should be aware of how your discharge naturally varies throughout your cycle and what is not normal but obvious warning signs of infection are a change in colour or consistency a sudden bad smell an unusually large amount of discharge another symptom alongside the discharge such as itching outside your vagina or pain in your pelvis or tummy unexpected bleeding from the vagina If you are not sure whether your discharge is normal and are worried about it see your GP or nurse Read about sexual health for general information and advice Theres a lot more on the site for your help but getting as you say extra

between two organs the treatment for most fistulas is surgical repair Now most vaginal fistulas require surgery to close the opening so I think yours should be as soon as possible it must be

varicella virus in adulthood Most of us are infected by varicella virus as children when it causes chickenpox After we recover from chickenpox varicella doesnt disappear but rather goes dormant hiding inside nerves under our skin for years Later in life varicella can erupt on the skin to cause the painful rash called herpes zoster or shingles Varicella is in the herpes virus family but is distinct from HSV1 and HSV2 the herpes viruses that commonly affect the lips and genitals Varicella is much more likely to affect external skin than moist mucous membranes inside the mouth or vagina Ulcers or

depend on what type of hysterectomy you had was it a Total hysterectomy or a Subtotal hysterectomy Hi This first piece of info is from the UKs NHS its a bit like your Abama scheme but has been running since the end of WW2 What if I didnt have sex Its possible for you to get pregnant without having sexual intercourse penetration if for example sperm get into your vagina  for example if you or your partner have semen or preejaculate on your fingers and touch your vagina your partner ejaculates near your vagina your partners erect penis comes into contact with your body near your vagina The risk of getting pregnant in this way is very low because sperm can only live for a short time outside of the body However if youre not planning a pregnancy its important to know that its possible to get pregnant in this way By the way are you natural with pubic hair or shaved Dr Hector Chapa answered If sperm gets around the outside of the vagina how likely is it to get pregnant Not likely For conception to occur several finely tuned processes must occur all in perfect order First of which is cervical bathingcoating by sperm The reason this is needed is because of all the volume deposited at the cervix some will leak out some will never enter the cervix some will die in the uterine cavity Sperm deposited on the exterior of the vagina cant migrate into the vaginal canal Dr Tony T Ho answered My semen came into contact outside of her vagina by my penis i didnt release sperm thereShe also has sist in her overyCould she get pregnant Always possible Any time there is contact of semen to a womans genital vault there is the possibility of pregnancy It doesnt sound like its very likely in this situation but you wont get a no its not possible here Have her do a pregnancy test in 2 weeks to be sure Dr Ravi D Chauhan answered If sperm gets on or around my vagina can I get pregnant Yes In a fertile woman any contact of sperm with the vaginal tissues can result in conception Hi Ok for one if her mucus is to acidic then this would not do your sperm any good and probably render it useless which could be your problem of not getting pregnant OK one thing she could try is doing a week of twice daily sea salt baths with just a couple of handfuls of sea salt in each one but not two deep she must let this water get inside her vagina she can do PH check at home with PH paper If she still has a problem its either a good doctor or a gyno One other thing is she getting any discharge with this odour If so perhaps she has BV bacterial vaginosis or reoccurring BV the sea salt could help if boric acid she can by capsules from a chemist for them but she needs to ask for them Do hope this helps Good Luck PS Get her to have a look at this site httpwwwmyhomeremediescomstaticyeastinfectionshtml Just copy into google to see it She could find some other ideas Hi Just to make sure its not an STI or STD its a game of elimination so start at an

all this or HRT but dont forget the sun and vitamin D and vitamin B 6 or a multi B complex should help your dryness also google DHEA for women Hi With a problem this bad doctor ASAP or an ER Good Luck See Above answer And last sorry could not post all this in one go Can you get pregnant from sperm outside your body If a man ejaculates around the labia of a womans vagina the tail like whip of the sperm may guide it to the inside of a womans vagina  The mission of each sperm is to reach the unfertilized egg and it has no problem with heading in the right direction if the travel occurs quickly it can get inside where it can live up to two weeks in the womans uterus before inpregnation no once sperm touches oxygen or air it is killed think of it as bacteria it dies when its not at body temperature The two answers above are both false First of all sperm are very fragile and they are not on a mission to reach a womans egg Truth be told experiment after experiment has shown that sperm have no sense of direction and cant swim very well Thus the reason that millions of sperm must be present and ejaculated INSIDE a woman so that maybe a handful can reach an egg if present Also sperm dont die when they hit the air they only die once the semen dies If you dont know semen is the liquid you can see that contains the sperm which you cant see If the semen is dry the sperm are dead Think about this even under perfect conditions where both people are fertile and healthy the woman is perfectly ovulating and the man ejaculates directly into her vagina the chances of pregnancy are never more than 80 So if under perfect conditions it is still relatively difficult to get pregnant than it is nearly impossible to get pregnant in any other fashion Put it this way there has never been a case other than the birth of Jesus son of Mary where a virgin gets pregnant So in the real world a man cant just ejaculate on a woman and get her pregnant the two must have sex It is impossible to keep your virginity and get pregnant because sperm must be inside a woman for her to get pregnant and this cant happen if there is no intercourse If a man ejaculates on a womans stomach face breasts etc there is no chance of pregnancy because the sperm cant just waltz into a womans vagina Many women may say that they didnt have sex and yet got pregnant but this is not the case Knowledge is power So there you are there all from different sites Some doctors and some not but you do have to remember that sperm when ejaculated inside the vagina is there at your cervix now just add all the way it has to travel through thick mucus and then it has to break into the cervix its a long way to go I know its there job and add into that its only a small amount of sperm it would not be the full load So lots to have read and think about But why not give it a try or trial to see if can be done But please let us know how you got on Do hope this helps you Good Luck Hi Its safe after 4 to 6 weeks this would depend on how healthy you and a lot would be how you feel But you should start slowly and just work back up there is no need to try and break any records its not a race and think of your body at all times You dont want to undo anything you have had done Hope this helps you Good Luck Hi See Answer above Hi This first bit is from the NHS Genital herpes can cause painful red blisters or

on an idea just google these does nicotine cause bv does nicotine cause yeast infections Now under this last one found you this but most of the info is from smoking httpwwwyeastinfectionnewscomtypestobaccoyeastinfections Tobacco Use When caused by the use of tobacco yeast infections can occur in anyone The reason that tobacco use increases the risk of oral thrush is that it alters the chemistry of your mouth allowing the Candida bacteria to move into a position of power Your mouth is already a prime area as far as Candida is concerned because in is generally both warm and moist The skin in some parts of your mouth is also very thin allowing Candida better access to the supplies of nutrients hidden just below the surface Generally your helper bacteria and immune system can stave off Candida infection but if you do something like chew tobacco smoke or just generally practice poor dental hygiene you could be helping to swing the balance in the direction of the bacteria If you have dentures you are at a particularly high risk of developing oral thrush particularly if the dentures dont fit well and if you also use tobacco yeast infections are very likely to develop Perhaps this will help better Good Luck Hi See Above Answer sorry it wont come up without a prompt glitch on WebMD Hi Have we thought of getting tested either at home or by your

gets medical help on safe ways to have sex without giving it to them if they dont have it This is actually perfectly normal Every females vagina looks different and to have labia minora that hang out beyond the labia majora is the most common No your doctor will most likely not be able to tell if you have been pregnant in the past by doing an exam However it is of utmost importance that you tell your doctor about you complete medical and surgical history because it can affect your current pregnancy in significant ways In addition it is important that you tell your doctor at your first visit You may want to speak with the doctor first and then invite your mom in or talk to the doctor first with your mom in the room and then have her step out when the exam is done so that you can tell your doctor then Another way would be to see your doctor for your initial exam without her and then invite her to your first ultrasound Realize that the information in your medical record is completely confidential unless you indicate that it is okay to speak with specific people about it I want to find the sperm so the question is is that easy even though that would be sand in the vagina Yes very dry 1 When we were able to it was about once a month Now its to painful to even try 2 Yes 3We are not using sex oils its more like spit 4 No I have also been tested for every STD every test was negative He was also tested he got negatives as well Just give him a bj that will contain the spill You can still get pregnant if you are menstruating so making your period come sooner will not stop you from getting pregnant Other than the morning after pill which it sounds like it might be too late to take now there isnt anything else you can do to avoid getting pregnant from that sexual encounter In the future avoid pregnancy by using an effective birth control method Discuss options with your doctor or Planned Parenthood There are a lot of options available If you have had unprotected sex before your symptoms started its possible you may have a STD There are a number of women who experience this as the uterus grows Usually women describe it as sharp stabbing pain in the vaginal area This may be related to the uterus growing and stretching If you have vaginal bleeding you should contact your physician The other question is whether you have had an ultrasound to confirm the pregnancy is in the uterus If you have not you should definitely contact your physician to make sure you are all right This should be a normal finding Yes you can get scabies from your partner but not IN your vagina Scabies would like appear in your genital area hands or basically any skin surface that has a prolonged contact Scabies is a SKIN infestation and the inside of the vagina is not skin but rather mucous membrane You should consider avoiding sexual contact until your boyfriends scabies is successfully treated and cured and see your own medical provider if you are having any signs of scabies yourself an itchy rash Noa lump in this area is not normal You will need to see your medical provider for an examination to determine exactly what it is there are MANY possibilities There is no way to blindly make that call over the Internet Probably the most common cause of outer vaginal itching would be yeast  Yeast loves warm dark and moist places and the vagina really fits the requirements Yeast is present in our environment so you do not have to catch it from someone It can just happen You may want to consider using one of the many overthecounter vaginal yeast medications to see if it helps Another possibility would be a contact dermatitis If you recently changed laundry detergents dryer softeners or soaps this could be a culprit as well If home treatments are not helping you will need to see your health care provider for a proper examination diagnosis and treatment Did the doctor give these bumps a name diagnosis Since I cant examine you there is really no way for me or any medical provider to be able to address a treatment for an unknown medical condition There are MANY things that can cause bumps Get some more information and repost your question Your first problem is your bad decision to have unprotected sex with friends plural who have most likely had unprotected sex with other people as well The list of sexuallytransmitted diseases that you may have been exposed to is extensive Itching can be as simple as a yeast infection or as lifelongcomplicated as having early stages of herpes You can have a bacterial vaginosis chlamydia syphillis HPVthe list is longer Itching can also be caused by pediculosis crabs scabies You cannot adequately diagnose a person by a photo no more than you can determine if your sexual partners are diseasefree simply because they looked clean You need to get your sore bottom off to a medical provider so that you can be properly examined carefully tested and treated Life is a series of lessons and I certainly hope that you have learned from this experience to NEVER do this again The ONLY treatment is surgery I am sorry There are no nonsurgical ways of correcting this cosmetic issue Insurances will not pay for cosmetic procedures so save your money Potentially yes Voltaren is a potent antiinflammatory medication use for arthritis that has absolutely no business being in a vagina rectum inside the nose or melting in your mouth I can potentially cause a chemical erosion of this delicate tissue so get it out theretake it out or douche it out before any damage occurs As much as I would like to know why or how a Voltaren ended up in your vagina I will trust that you will not do this again If you are having any vaginal pain or bleeding as a result of this you will need to see your medical provider for an examination Your medical provider will most likely ask the same question If one partner has active herpes the transmission to another person is possible via direct genital contact or contact by hands Your vaginal bumps and sores are not related to your urinary tract infection Up to 50 of all women have have classic symptoms of a UTI do not have positive urine cultures In other words the burning on urination is caused by something else Many times a women can have a subtle vaginal infection that can cause UTI symptoms or in your case sores due to  Since I have no way to see these bumps to offer you a patientspecific answer you will need to see your medical provider  someone who can examine you and make the determination Herpes is transmitted by direct contact with the skin or mucous membrane It can be easily transmitted during sex but not through the ejaculate I know of no STD that appears as a bump a few hours after having sex so this may be just some vaginal trauma Since you did have sex two weeks ago probably without a condom there is still the possibility that you were exposed to an STD Getting tested would be advised Using a condom next time would be less expensive lessstressful for you and infinitely safer Yes unfortunately there are viable sperm in the seminal secretions the occur before ejaculations to the possibility of pregnancy exists When a condom breaks your girlfriend has the option of taking the morning after pillor you will both need to sweat it out and see if she has her normal menstrual period That would not be likely Yeast likes warm dark moist places like the vagina or inside a diaper The eyes and nose really doesnt have a welcoming environment that would be favorable to yeast You are safe Maybe a hysterectomy will be the recommendation but surgery isnt always the answer Your doctor will discuss any nonsurgical options if reasonable but in the endthe doctorsurgeon will need to prove to your insurance company the third party payers that an expensive surgery is required in your case Since I do not know the medical details of your caseonly the brief information you have postedI really have no right to render a patientspecific opinion Intestinal gas can only be burpedbelchedor farted There is no anatomical communication between the intestines and the vagina Of course notyou need to see your gynecologist and find out why Yes If you want to know that answer you are going to need to SEE a medical provider so that you can be properly examined There is absolutely no way for me or any medical provider to blindly make an accurate diagnosis over the Internet There are zillions of different rashes but high on that list would need to be yeast because of its location Rather than worry about infidelity or an STD just see your medical provider be examined and leave with the right answerand most likely the proper treatment Confusion Your virgin niece had the flu and now YOU have blister like sores round your vagina or hers I am not sure which one of you has the problem based on your posting If you are talking about influenza causing blisterlike vaginal sores it does not If you are asking what those particular sores are I really dont know since I cannot examine them nor order any diagnostic tests A medical office visit is going to be needed Maybe a bit Diphenhydramine Benadryl can try up other mucous membranes like the nose or mouth so it could cause some dryness South of the Border so to speak as well Most of these little tears I am assuming it is little will heal rapidlyin just a few days There is really little that you can put on this area but a vaselinebased ointment or just plain vaseline will protect the area from urinary irritation Just keeping the area clean during a shower is usually sufficient and of course avoiding intercourse until you have completely healed Yes KY is watersoluble and fine to use or you can also smear a little of the Premarin cream on the applicator and use it as a lubricant The foreskin will automatically retract during intercourse that is the beauty of the design You need not retract it before insertion nor can you prevent it from retraction during sex If his penis is overly sensitive just slow down the process and make sure that the parts are well lubricated It will be fine The vast majority of men on this planet are uncircumcised just the way that God made them so things will be fine As far as penetration is concerned experiment with a few different positions It is likely that more than an inch is happening If you are not improving in a day or so you may need to see a medical provider for an examination Medical providers are bound by confidentiality so please dont worry that your secret will be revealed to a parent Just insist on being in the exam room alone and then disclose how this happened What you tell a parent is really up to you In the meantime spend some time sitting in a hot bathtuband keep fingers and other objects out of your vagina until you have healed As you may know I am at a distinct Internet disadvantage since I am unable to see these red bumps firsthand A description is just not sufficient to make this important call so you will need to have her pediatrician examine her As much as I would like to help you it would not be possible for me or any medical provider to make a blind determination I dont think her diapers or wipes are the culprit As you know I have no way of seeing or examining youI have only your description to go on One possibility would be a  perhaps a cyst that is secondarily infected These oil gland cysts are quite common in this area but you will need to see a medical provider so that you can be properly examined and treated You have had this for a month so it would be in your best interest to check in checked out so you will not have to worry The correct and lessvulgar term for the male genitalia is penis and the answer is a remote possibility of yes since there is viable sperm present in the tiny amount of semen that can leak during sexual excitation If you were ovulating at the time there is a remote possibility of a pregnancy occurring Needless to say if you and this penisowner do not plan on having a child at this time you will be wise to cautious with your sexplay Vaginal odor is often a sign of infection typically a bacterial or trichimonas so you may need to see your medical provider for an examination Another common cause is a retained tampon even if you think this could never happen A very slim chance if any It would be a very crafty sperm to make it through several layers of clothing swim up your vagina and then impregnate you If you are having this type of risky sex play remember that it will likely progress Be proactive Use some effective birth control to be safe You could not shave By going au natural for a while you will probably heal these ingrown hairs Many people who shave will get this condition called folliculitis and the best solution is not to shave If you must shave then use a new clean razor each time Use an antibacterial soap or a get a prescription antibacterial solutionlotion to use on the area after you shave You need to see a medical provider so you can be properly examined and treated which may involve lancing this lump depending on what it is This could be a thrombosed hemorrhoid a cyst abscess or  The possibility would be highly remoterelax The most likely cause would be an infectioneither a urinary tract infection or a vaginal infection In your case it could be both The urge to urinate is a primary symptom of a urinary infection but urethritis irritation of your urethra from vaginitis could also cause this annoying symptom You will need to see a medical provider so that you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated The condom can cause an irritation but so can the act of vaginal sexespecially for the first timeThe redness or swollen area at the entrance to your vagina could be from some tiny tears along your hymen assuming you still had one at the time you had sex for the first time Burning on urination could be cystitis irritation and inflammation at the opening where you pee used to be called honeymoon cystitis back in the days when the honeymoon was the first time a woman had sex or even a urinary tract infection Sexual activity can stir up a lot of germs in this area  and germs can lead to a urinary or bladder infection Germs can come from fingers mouths oral sex as well as a penis Now that you have chosen to be sexually involved you have a responsibility to make adultlike decisions when it comes to your medical care If you do have a urinary tract infection burning on urination frequency urgency or even blood when you wipe this needs to be medically evaluated A urine test will not reveal your recent sexual debut so it is really up to you whether to disclose this information A pelvic examination is not usually needed to make this diagnosisonly a simple urine test My suggestion would be for you to get checkedjust in case Women and girls of all ages can get urinary infections whether they are having sex or not Obviously infections are more common if you do have sex I am pleased that you and your partner used a condom Make sure you use them 100 of the time or urinary burning will be the least of your problems Tissues in this area may itch for a variety of reasons the most common being yeast even if you do not see it and contact reactions soap laundry detergents dryer sheets etc As an experiment try a 5050 combination of 1 hydrocortisone cream with any antiyeast medication both are available over the counter Rinse carefully after a shower and avoid harsh soaps Rinse underwear twice to make sure there are no soap residuals and do not use perfumed dryer sheets If you have recently changed soaps or detergents this may be a culprit If this fails you may need to see your womens health professional for an examination and more detailed medical history I dont have any way of knowing if your vaginal discharge is an STD or not since I cant examine you look at the discharge under a microscope or test it in a lab nor do I know your sexual history or your boyfriends sexual history The only thing you can do if your doctors treatment is not working is to go backbe reexamined and be tested this time by a vaginal culture or smear A person can have a yeast infection AND something else so if you are worried about an STD that something else will need to be specifically tested See your gynecologist There could be a discoverable reason why you are having painful sex so you wont have to use EMLA an anesthetic cream I have no idea since I have no way of examining you My suggestion would be for you to see a gynecologist they are surgeons to see if you can have this aberrant tissue whatever it is removed NGU just means that the STD is not gonorrhea There are other STDs and is the most likely culprit although other bacteria can cause vaginal and urinary tract symptoms No one really uses the term NGU anymore I am not sure exactly what fleshy area you are talking about so I would suggest that your bring this up during a gynecological exam so that your practitioner can address this concern Most normal female anatomy does not interfere with intercourse but if you have some sort of a unique anomaly then a medical provider will need to see it The urethral area alone can be quite sensitive from intercourse In the meantime please ask that your partner exercise a bit more caution during sex so that any sensitive area is not traumatized A woman gets pregnant when viable sperm meets a ripe ovum egg Typically this takes place outside the Fallopian tubesnot on the outside of your vulva Since there are millions of sperm and usually only one egg the chances are slim It would be wise to keep an uncondomed penis away from the front door in the future I could not possibly answer that question based solely on the brief vague information in your posting I do not know what you had twenty years ago in your mouth that came back nowthere are numerous conditions that cause sores Your other symptomsnausea vomiting joint weakness achey and vaginal sores last summerare so nonspecific that it is going to take a thorough medical investigation just to narrow down the many possibilities You will need to see your medical provider to start the diagnostic process No Yes you can push the tampon back in with your fingeror just use another one Nothing bad will happen There are brands of tampons that do not use a tube applicator Find the sandor the sperm During a pelvic exam we really dont look for either one but if a smear was taken and microscopically examined then yessperm may be seen The sand we would likely just ignore Absolutely not The air inside does not mean anything let alone proof of infidelity Nothat is just your sexual preference As long as your partner is willing and cooperative I dont think you will need to join a 12Step program It is possible but unfortunately I have no way of accurately diagnosing you based solely on the information you have provided It would not be inappropriate for you to try a vaginal yeast medication available overthecounter The pharmacist can help select one for you Of course This is really the ONLY way to get a accurate diagnosis  the reason for you vaginal odor and postcoital spotting There can be many reasonsfrom infections to a retained tampon assuming you use tampons Get it checked out These are most likely labial adhesions The cream is estrogen and will really help if you use it You only need to gently put a tiny amount on the area a few times a week In about a month all should appear normal again She will tolerate it IF it is done gentlythis is a very sensitive area You most definitely have the signs and symptoms of vaginitis but it would be up to your medical provider to determine if this is due to an STD or not There are many types of vaginitis that can cause odor and discharge from bacterial vaginosis and trichomonas so this discharge may need to be microscopically examined or tested in the lab A retained tampon is also a common cause of a malodorous vaginal discharge You will need to see your medical provider so that you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated Little girls can get definitely vaginitis but not likely true bacterial vaginosis The most common bacteria in this area are the enteric ones  germs that have migrated from her analrectal area and set up residence Take her to her pediatrician The area can be cultured to see what bug might be involved And there is one more possibility Children often put things in bodily openingsears nose and yes even the vagina The pediatrician will need to search for a foreign body It could even be a wad of toilet tissue children like to imitate when they are being pottytrained or  The solution starts with an accurate diagnosis so get that appointment made If your history as true and I have no doubt that you are being honest the most likely cause IS a yeast infection Yeast loves warm dark moist places and your vagina fits the bill perfectly Yeast is notorious for causing extreme itching swelling redness and a discharge so do not hesitate to talk to your mother In most cases your mother has experienced vaginal yeast infections herself and will be able to help you There are many effective overthecounter medications and even an oral pill that your medical provider can prescribe This problem can be easily fixed so dont delay Sex workers no matter what they charge have a higher incidence of sexuallytransmitted diseases when compared to the general population Multiple partners infrequent testing and preexisting STDs that may not be obvious at the time of exposure are the greatest risks that one might encounter Whether you were exposed to one or more of the array of STDs out there is anyones guess Your concern should have been raised BEFORE seeking sexual contact with a prostitute but of course that is a bit too late now Testing may or may not reveal exposure or diseases in there incubation process but I think that it would be wise to be tested based on your level of worry over this incident Any soap that you use for your face you can use for your genital area Rinsing with fresh water is always advised The vagina has a natural lubricant so it should not be the soap that is responsible for any dryness Check with your medical provider if this is an ongoing issue No I cant say this is common but it does happen You will need to see your medical provider to be properly examined and treated It may be good to culture one of those boils to see what organism is causing the issue usually Staph What happens The girl usually gets another boyfirend Is it safe Urine is usually sterile but may have a high gross factor If the guy is wearing a condom like he should urination could be a problem Is it possible Probably but wouldnt it be better for him to urinate in the toilet Yes you will need to see your medical provider so that you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated These are two different problems an ovarian cyst will not cause vaginal odor or an urge to urinate Vaginitis andor a urinary tract infection will need to be ruled out Are you absolutely sure she has scabies If that white thing that crawled out of her vagina was live she most likely has pinworms If so you will see a lot of those threadlike worms around her anal area if you check her when she is sleeping pinworms come out a night and cause considerable itching in this area While the chance of pregnancy is small it is not zero Semen that is excreted during sexual excitation can be loaded with viable sperm There is no way to calculate your chances of getting your girlfriend pregnant by this risky sex play so you will need to sweat it out She could take a morning after pill or you can just wait until she has or misses her next period Take this experience as a serious lesson Use a condom Your girlfriend should be on some sort of birth control Andyou should NOT be engaging in sexual activity that could end up with an unintentional pregnancy These exercises are not problematic but if you want to stop the habit it is really up to you to work out the best method This would be no different than to stop bitting your nails First step Become aware that you are doing them Second step when you become aware STOP doing them Judge the success of your efforts by keep track of the number of times per hour you are starting and stopping them There are no magic methods to habit control Sperm can remain alive and viable for about if protected in the cervical mucous Is it really that important on which day you became pregnant If it is an exact date of conception may be a difficult to determine based solely on isolated days of unprotected sex In most cases an abnormal vaginal discharge of this nature indicates an infection usually a bacterial infection It would be best for you to be carefully examined so that you can be properly diagnosed and treated Only if you had yeast in your mouth It is still called a vaginaAfter a hysterectomy the vagina really doesnt change very much other than the fact that it now ends in a pouch rather than the cervix opening to the uterus The vagina is 95 just the way it was I am not exactly clear on your question but Shingles also called herpes zoster is a form of herpesthe same virus that causes chicken pox fever blisterscold sores and genital herpes Having sex again after 12 years of inactivity can be a bit anxietyproducing for you Having unbearable pain with sex is definitely adding to this anxiety Your first and most important step is to see your gynecologist for an examination Not knowing your age vaginal dryness would be one possibility Intercourse can cause tiny little tears in your delicate vaginal tissue so these fissures could be reopening each time you attempt to have sex There can be other issues of course Dont be embarrassed to discuss this with your medical provider It is a real problem that needs a proper solution Your partners penis size is not as important as his gentleness patience and caring so you may need to postpone vaginal sex for a while until you can be properly examined and treated I am confident that this problem can be fixed and that you will soon be enjoying sex again It is possible to become pregnant without fullpenetration sex While it may be uncommon ejaculation at the vaginal opening does put this woman at risk for pregnancy If you do not want an unintentional pregnancy you should NOT be doing this sort of risky activity Keeping viable sperm as far away as possible from a vagina would be in your best interest Use a condom or stop playing sexual Russian Roulette It would not be prudent to make a blind guess Since I have no way of examining you no photos please I suggest that you see your womens health specialistgynecologist or primary care provider for an exam Not knowing your age it could be a cystocele or rectocele but again it is important to get properly examined Probably not but no one has really tested this in a clinical study This would be considered an individual female response and not a universal response typical in all women I agree with the nurse practitionerusing tiny amounts of estrogen cream just on the areas that are adherent is SAFE and highlyeffective There are little or no side effects if you use this hormonal ointment sparingly and periodically Many of my patients with labial adhesions need to use it again and again to control this very common problem Soon your little girl 4 or five more years will be making her own estrogen and it will not likely be an issue A gastroenterologist is a licensed and highlytrained physician Many were primary care clinicians before they specialized While a vaginal exam may not be integral part of hisher practice finding the underlying reason for undiagnosed abdominal pain may require more than just a short trip up the colon or down the throat to the stomach Pelvic causes for abdominal pain are really high on the list so this clinician is most likely being very thorough They are definitely allowed to do this exam if there is a justifiable reason to do so Now if your podiatrist or a chiropractor wanted to do a vaginal exam I would call that highlysuspicious Your first step  long before considering gender reassignment and drastic dangerous surgery  would be to see a psychiatrist As a matter of fact a psychiatrist intervention and recommendation is required before any surgeon would consider touching a patient You are young You are not wellinformed about these very complicated matters By discussing your deepest feelings and concerns with a trained counselor you may be able to find some peace with the body that Nature has given you or pave the pathway to the next steps Yes the transmission of the herpes virus can be oralgenital There are many different causes of vaginal irritation so before getting to worried see your medical provider or womens health professional for a proper examination diagnosis and treatment No That is absolutely ridiculous and racist I have no way of diagnosing or treating you blindly over the Internet but a Bartholin Cyst is most likely what you have Since this cyst is painful and engorged it would be wise to see a gynecologist right away so it can be properly drained If this cyst is recurrent you may need a marsupilization procedure where the entire cyst sac is removed to keep it from coming back No not unless the surgeon specific recommends it to limit the remote chance of infection Every surgeon is different and they all have their own ways If you are going to trust the surgeon to do this procedure then trust their judgment in this issue as well Pubic hair will grow back No the sperm are just fine swimming through a little vaginal blood Vaginal blood will not prevent pregnancy but having sex during a true menstrual period means that you are not ovulating If you are not ovulating you cannot conceive Sperm can be viable for a week or so trapped in vaginal or cervical mucous so having unprotected sex toward the end of your period is iffy so never count on this as a 100 method of birth control Some women will have vaginal bleeding midcycle at a time of ovulation so dont get fooled For that extraadded insurance it is always wise for couples to use condoms Yes it appears that would be the best course of action An abscess may require an immediate drainage more than just a needle packing or a wick inserted and an appropriate course of antibiotics Eczema atopic dermatitis can become worse during times of stress The dry rash can appear on any part of the body that has skin If you are having ongoing issues seeing a dermatologist would be appropriate Your vaginal yeast infection would not be related to eczema Unfortunately your description of white tags is very vaguenot sufficient to make a definitive diagnosis You will need to see a gynecologist to have a proper examination to determine the true nature of these tags and a proper treatment Your boyfriend may be not be telling the truth Chlamydia is caused by exposure to someone else that has Chlamydiasimple as that Going from anal to vaginal sex can cause a severe bacterial infection from pathogens that live in the colon This is not a safe sexual practice Both you and your boyfriend need to be carefully tested since Chlamydia is often accompanied by other STDs Word to the Wise Use condoms with this guyand other guys too Anatomically there is really nothing you can do to change this close proximity other than being very careful not to contaminate the vagina with any germs from the anal area It is what it is There is no problem having sex when you are on this medication Remember that you are still being treated for a bacterial vaginosis so this is like kissing someone when you have a strep throat before you have completed the treatment If this is your only partner has your partner been treated Yeast can occur on ANY skin or mucous membrane surfaces like the mouth in the groin between the toes or under breasts Men can get yeast infections A vagina is not a requirement Are you sure you do not have a vagina If you had a hysterectomy only the uterus and ovaries were removed Woman are left with a vagina California I am not sure that you meant to type the name of a state Unfortunately it would not be possible to determine that nature of your painful bumps based solely on a vague description You will need to see a medical professional for a proper examination and perhaps so diagnostic tests to get a definitive answer I encourage you to do so The odds of an unintentional pregnancy would be very very low Not very likely assuming his vasectomy was a success I have a suggestion why dont you keep fooling around and capture some of that ejaculated semen so it can be properly tested at the lab for viable sperm This way you will know for sure for any future sexual mishaps Yes The tampon will over no protection against pregnancy but your menstrual cycle most likely willAssuming this is a normal period you are not ovulating so the chance of an unintentional pregnancy is very low A hysterectomy only removes the uterus Any woman of any age who still has a vagina can most definitely get a vaginal yeast infection especially after being on systemic antibiotics It is prudent to use the over the counter yeast medication that you have mentioned the antiitch medication would only treat the itch not the cause Obviously if you are not improving you will need to consult your medical provider for patientspecific advice As much as I would like to help you I have absolutely no way to blindly determine the nature of this pimple over the Internet based solely on your brief posting You would need to be examined first to determine if this pimple is an infection or not and then be treated accordingly I could not recommend any overthecounter cream since your diagnosis is unclear It would be highly unlikely for her to get pregnant in the way you described assuming you are telling the whole story You and your girlfriend are playing with fire so to speak If you keep up with this risky sexplay that tends to escalate over time there could be an unintentional pregnancy in your future If you are sexually involved it is time for you BOTH to get serious about contraception Why not use a condom when you are playing around Should your sexual practice progress and they usually do make sure that she is also using an effective contraceptive as well The only surefire contraception is abstinence and you are definitely not practicing that so be smart Herpes does not cause or contribute to bacterial vaginosis Vaginal odor could be BVor trichomonasor even an impacted tampon so it would be best to see your medical provider so you can be properly examined and diagnosed BV can be cured with the right medical regime I am not sure what your doctors are using but this is not a difficult problem to treat You can keep getting it back however if it is coming from the same sexual source You will need to call your doctor It would not be prudent for me to try and treat you over the Internet I can say that the amoxicillin is long gone so if you are still having hives there is likely another allergen that is the culprit An amoxicillin reaction a month ago would not be causing issues now Washing up after sex will not wash away any semen that is deposited and entrapped in the cervical mucous  these are the sperm that have a chance of impregnation Advice is mixed about lying on your back or with a pillow under your buttocks to encourage gravity to help but it is fine to do so dont jump up and rush to the shower I dont believe the contracting your vaginal muscles will help that much for increasing your chances of conception but doing these Kegeltype exercises has some other advantages Having an intense orgasm during intercourse will help so remind your partner to be generous and considerate Not really but the evaluation does start with a basic exam Fertility is more complex than just a look and see exam It involved a complex array of hormones ovulation the health of some anatomical structures  uterus Fallopian tubes ovaries  most of which cannot be seen on a vaginal examination and of course the fertility of a male partner For instance a woman may be perfectly capable of conceiving but her partner has a very low sperm count Call your surgeon or primary care doctor for patientspecific advice You may need to have a blood count and certainly be examined No it would not be consider normal to be bleeding from your rectum whether you are on your period or not You need to see your medical provider so that you can be properly examined and determine the source of this bleeding This is not something that can be determined over the Internet You may need to have a hearttoheart talk with him about balancing your sexual activity so that it is pleasurable for BOTH of you and perhaps use a sexual lubricant to help you with the dryness and irritation Your problem could be psychological or physical or perhaps even a bit of both Either way the erectile dysfunction can be easily rectified with several different medicines designed to increase and maintain blood flow engorgement to the penis If you maintain your erection longer you will not likely have any related performance anxiety so the problem could fix itself with a little blue pill You may not always need it but you may find this to be a temporary solution These require a prescription so you will need to ask your medical provider Just one failure to perform could create a feeling that it will happen again so this is where the psychological component plays a role Assuming you do not have any underlying medical issues or psychological stresses affecting your life at the moment this should get you back in the saddle again Herpes is notoriously PAINFUL not itchy However without the ability to see this bump firsthand it would not be possible to really provide that answer You would need to see your medical provider especially if you are at risk for sexuallytransmitted disease and this bump persists or worsens Nobut something is wrong with you and your boyfriends brain If you do not want to have an unplanned pregnancy you need to use an effective form of contraception At the very least your boyfriend should use a condom100 of the time Not all ejaculations end up with an immediate pregnancy so you may have lucked out this time Pulling out before ejaculation is not an effective brith control method Playing the Pregnancy Lottery however will most likely end up with you being pregnant if you keep up your risky sexual practices Ask her Dont just assume that her vagina will reveal her recent sexual past while you were not together Did you have some sort of an understanding that she would not date or have sex with others while you were absent Were YOU celibate for the last three months If either one of you have had unprotected sex it is STD screening that should be your major concern Somebody is not telling the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help me God Unless there were some extraordinary circumstances genital herpes is caused by sexual contact Period Many times a person can transmit genital herpes to another without having any obvious lesions As a matter of fact may people who contract herpes is from someone who may not have even been aware they had it Yesyou could have gotten it from your first sexual partner who did not disclose a previous partner No dont worry about the paint In most cases the only paint that would even be a minor issue would be leadbased paint I suspect you were using latex or oilbased paint If it was dried this is not going to create risk your wife but for Goodness Sake wash your hands next time before you get amorous No woman wants a painted hand caressing them It depends on how good he is as a visual diagnostician Genital herpes does have a characteristic appearance and history but when someone give you a medicine for a bacterial vaginosis a herpes medicine and a yeast medicine he is doing shotgun treatmentsort of throwing everything at the issue hoping one will hit it I dont practice that way If your problem started with an itch and a bit of peeling I think yeast Bacterial vaginosis can have a characteristic odor and yeast can have a characteristic appearance but it would be best to confirm it with a diagnostic test usually a microscopic exam or vaginal culture The same goes for herpes There is a very accurate diagnostic test when you have active lesions that would have given you the answer Since herpes is contagious and recurrent it would sure be nice to know definitively I agree with you You need to know for sure and deserve a higher level of care than a two minute look and see Rarely but it has reportedly happened It is best to try to avoid this in the future There can be about 400 million or so of those sperm wigglers so you dont want any swimming upstream Even with sex play it is best that your partner wear a condom to keep those tricky sperm wellcontained As an effective backup perhaps you should be on birthcontrol as well You will worry less Shingles are caused by the herpes virus Cold sores are also caused by the herpes virus Canker sores and HPV are NOT herpetic Yes of course Vaginal dryness can be uncomfortable for both partners so it would be wise to use a sexual lubricant next time Sureif this exam is necessary for diagnosis and treatment Any licensed medical provider can do this exam You will need to see your health care provider or gynecologist for a proper examination to determine the true nature of this lump Your description is just too vague for me to be able to narrow down the several possibilities but one common lump could be a Bartholin gland cyst  You can do a little research to see if that fits the bill The fact that this lump is bigger and more painful emphasizes the importance of medical intervention The chance of a pregnancy is not very highthis time but you are engaging in some very risky sexual behavior that could lead to a pregnancy situation in the future I suspect this will not be the last time that you engage in these activities Clearly keeping a penis and sperm as far away from a vagina is the preferable Practice using condoms during your sex play thus containing ALL of the semen or better yet have your partner get on an effective form of contraception It is only a matter of time before your mutual passion and sexual excitation will lead to intercourse Then your chances are VERY GOOD that an unintentional pregnancy will happen You and your partner are engaging in risky sexual activities so act like a mature person Be proactive use more common sense Use birth control And be very very careful That is a personal skill that I really cant help you with very much In most cases a vaginal suppository or cream should not be expelled when you urinate A woman has gotta pee you know You are too embarrassed to see a medical professional Why This is their job and this prolapse can be fixed Make an appointment with a good female gynecologist The best and permanent fix involves some surgery but in the meantime a pessary a device ithat can be inserted in your vagina to hold back this prolapsed tissue may help The first step is an examination to determine the SOURCE of the blood The most common cause of blood in the stools assuming it is bright red blood would be a fissure a small tear polyp or hemorrhoid If the bleeding is from the vaginal area and examination will determine the source Contact allergy could do itdryer softener sheets with perfume is high on my list followed by enzymatic detergents and bath soaps It could even be that feminine spray even if you have used it in the past Products often change ingredients without changing the brand name A yeast infection is quite common in this area so if the itch is limited to the clitoral area use a topical antifungal perhaps mixed halfhalf with 1 hydrocortisone cream These may be tiny fissures or tears but this is just a blind guess since I cannot see it Fissures should heal in a week or so if you keep the area very clean and dry be careful when you towel dry it would be better to pat dry this area Use a topical antibiotic ointment and check the area periodically with a mirror to make sure it is not getting infected Make sure that your underwear is not irritating this sensitive area Wear more breathable cotton ones for now Should this area fail to heal or if you think it is getting worse you will need to see a medical provider The sperm doesnt even reach the egg for a day or two so a little spotting the next day is either the start of a period or the result of a little tiny tear Definitely get yourself tested if that will help you feel better Stress can also cause irregular periods as can diet so its not just your weight Best of luck yes It may be that your allergic to one of the minerals alone or a combination I was just unable to take any kind of pills while pregnant in all 5 pregnancies talk to your OB GYN or midwife for more Advice on what to do Drink a lot of water and then drink more water Make sure it is noted in your medical history that you are allergic to amoxicillin Witch hazel is the best for hives and itch  I gald you want till marrige to have sex you could use some KY but you be fine without it Unfortunately I have to agree with the other person here I dont think its acne Doesnt sound like acne It also doesnt sound like an ingrown hair either Sorry sister but I think you might have an STD Youre going to want to go get a real medical opinion on it Dont google it because the pictures will gross you out Go to your doctor Thats the best advice yes rashes and itching at the very least if you have a red blister that is fluid filled burns stings itches and hurts like a SOB then its quite possible warm H2O helps w the pain but it will have to be cultured by your dr to know for sure if it craters after the blister is gone then probably so dont have sex until you know for sure yeah its 100 sure you can get pregnant bcoz you had unprotected sex if you dont want to keep it you can take birth control pills you can buy from chemist shop or online at  You may have bacteria vaginosis call to schedule an

problem when I noticed the rough patch it turned white so I went to my doctor and he did a biopsy and found that I have vulva dysplasia so far ive had 3 biopsies and had surgery once where they removed the dysplasia patches and also did laser you should see your doctor soon and ask him or her about vulva dysplasia sorry but if not treated it can turn into a serious issue I hope I helped even just a little While you are having vaginal bleeding and lower abdominal pain I would let my body have a rest from sexual activity There is always time for sex but your health is the most important thing for you Whenever you are having pain your body is telling you something is wrong Using the Plan B pill is not healthy for use as birth control it should be used as an emergency measure Let your body get in a regular cycle then get on a birth control plan that you are comfortable with Remember you cant have any type of enjoyment if you do not take care of your body Snuggle up and get your health back If he wont want it tells you he would not be around if you get really ill Good luck get well I feel the same way The conception date wouldve only been one week ago I dont remember the symptoms so soon Any one have insight or is it in my head Okay so what if you are only 23 years old and going threw this but your not going threw mendapose me and my husband want to get pregnant but

prudcing any eggs so i cant have kids so what can it all be This happened with my 5 year old little girl as well Sometimes as their bodies are growing theyre internal workings do not grow as fast as theyre outer bodies it could be a few seperate things As her lady parts are trying to keep up with the body they are in sometimes after urinating and wiping there can be a pocket of urine that does not come down until after the majority of urine has been expelled She could be so ready to get back to playing that she hurries in the restroom to get back to whatever game she was playing It could also be a sign of stress It could also be the starting sign of a UTI Ask her if it hurts when she urinates or if her lady parts are itchy If it goes on continually or increases and it is not behavioral related take her to the doctor and have her tested for a UTI and for diabetes Maybe have her use the restroom then wipe stand up do a little dance then hop back on the pot to see if that pocket can be expelled As for the redness could be Both things are very normal just stay patient with her and help her to know that you are not upset with her for having wet underware even if it does mean an addition to the mountain of laundy that is already there from having childern Hope this helps I have done a home test but I have had to have blood test in the past with one of my pregnancies the home test came back negative but it was a cheap one I looked up the side effects and there is no mention of this side effect Here is the link that I found From what Ive read these are causes  but this condition is uncommon  lack of estrogen  radiation in that area of the body  no sex for years But it seems like it is reversable from the literature with the use of estrogen cream etc  but you would need to go to a doctor I hope this helps You might want to try washing your fingers after you masturbate it could take up to two weeks but usually only a few days I had exactly the same symptoms after giving oral sex you are not crazy infact my GERD symptoms started after i gave oral sex to my female partner Im currently trying antifungals in the hope to solve the root cause of the problem would really appreciate if anyone has some help to offer thanks yes of course they could n yes they would more than likely have to be removed if i were u i would be rushing to the er Its possible but not likely Pregnancy happens around the time of ovulation which usually happens well before a period Still your girlfriend may want to take a pregnancy test for sure arond the time of her next cycle This answer will give you more information httpanswerswebmdcomanswers1197986canawomengetpregnantafterguid3 herpies cant be cured when you contract herpies it can be treated so you are not infectious but just like cold sores they will return the virus can lay dormant for many years before returning if you are having any symptoms i suggest you contact your doctor for more treatment most likely i would say you have an STD you need to go to the gynocolgist me personly i would take it seriously more than 70 percent people has HPV make an appt immediatly that is not normal even if you are underage and you want to hide this from your panrents find the closest PLAN PARENTHOOD in your area and call them or get on the internet and google cheap noninsurance gynocologist office you need to do something about that please see a dr immediatly okay did the guy cum inside of you if he did then that is his sperm standing upor squeezing your vaginal muscles will make it come out and yes for some reason it has a distinct smell OR that can be your vaginal juice some women can squirt when they orgasm just look it up or ask your parents but its the women orgasm juice its mainly called discharge its the way of your insides clean you out just wash your self afterwards you have intercourse so you stay clean and have good hygiene now if your discharge ever turns to a brown or yellow or even greenish color or even if it stays clear white color but it has a disgusting fishy odor and so strong u can smell it coming out of your clothes u wearing or just it keeps iching go to the dr you have an STD or yeast infection or vaginal bacteria ALL OF THESE ARE VERY SERIOUS GO TO A DOCTOR I know a few women who have this problem One consistency with them all is that they tend to masturbate a lot only using their fingers If your wife does this then I would suggest talking to her about not doing it for a little while because our bodies tend to become used to achieving orgasm in its usual way making it harder to get there in other ways I also agree that increased foreplay might help too Yes mama it can also cause a Uti because if the person hands ae not clean they can put bacteria in your vigina which is not helpful because of viginia contains bacteria but nto bad but it can be harmful if things where to happen like that  You have have std like herpies from brushing on someone with an outbreak maybe not std unless his finger is cut and he puts that inside you then you have get infections which can worsten like a uti and go to kidney and your blood steam which leads to kidney and heart failure protect yourself honey I know what I am talking about It rare but it can happen so be careful that how I got myself into trouble honey and now i am pregnant make sure he doesnt penetrate because it doesnt hurt sometimes when it happen to me but I started of f with precum so it can happen If the woman had gonorrhoea it can cause a throat infection though not chronic It is very likely that it is a result of your GERD You may require certain lifestyle modifications like decreased caffiene intake chocolates by stopping late meals and increasing excercise can u also feel a popping and granding u may have dislocated ur pelivc bone Do you have small lesions near or in your private area They start out small and will be red then grow a little larger and have a white pimple like top The first outbreak is usually the most uncomfortable and actually hurts burns and itches Subsequent breakouts will not be as painful as the initial breakout i have type genital herpes as well going on 3 and a half years i am still a bit confused as to the difference between type 1 and 2 i do believe my is 2 but everything i have read once you have one you cant get the other thought you can make it spread to the mouth and eyes i have read i take very good care of myself since getting it and i have not spread it to myself farther or to another person i do avoid sex when i have an outbreak and i have never took the meds expect the 1st time stress is a factor along with poor health can cause outbreaks 6 weeks Totally avoid sex w him If you get checked annually and there was nothing wrong obviously he is the one that is infected Dont know if you know this but herpes is treatable not curable So be careful Okay so Type 1 is common to oral area and Type 2 is common to genital area You just have Type 1 on your genitals It will not turn into Type 2 Your test will always come back positive for Type 1 no matter where on your body it shows up Typical outbreaks happen during stressful or extra moist for prolong periods of time Herpes outbreaks will become less frequent the longer you have had it Your partner is always at risk whether you have an active outbreak or not  You can pass it days before you notice an outbreak Be honest with your partner  as you know this is a life long disease Always let your OBGYN knowwhen you decide to have a baby they will give you a daily supressive med to keep from passing along to your child OR you can opt for a Csection Good Luck God Bless and hope this helped Hi I knowbyoubposted the question a month ago but I came accross it  wanted to shared something that will work great No a girl cant get pregnant when a man puts his finger in her vagina His finger doesnt have sperm coming out of it the air is pushed inside by a smaller than average penis also some positions are much worse and im being serious here if you have a 7 penis and better than average girth this will not happen I have been using viraduxau for over a year and have not had a single outbreak I also had vaginal ulcers but they went away after I tried this product wwwviraduxcom There is alo tons of research and helpful videos at the site Hope this helps more in likely I am not circumcised and my foreskin sometimes retracts during intercourse and sometime it does not The more enlarged with blood my penis is the less the skin retracts I used to always retract it when first married but then found that the foreskin can act as a way of aiding penetration if penetration is started when while the foreskin is on the head of the penis Most uncircumcised guys I have talked to say that their penis is sensitive enough so that if the foreskin rolls back and exposes the penile head during intercourse they are very aware of it Most like that a few dont About half of the boys in the town where I grew up were uncut about half cut because there were two doctors delivering babiesone tried to talk all parents into leaving their boys intact the other tried to talk all parents into having their boys uncircumcised In my opinion the majority of uncircumcised males can tell if their foreskin is retracted during intercourse based on my conversations with other uncircumcised males As far as penetration you can get a good idea of how much penetration there is by measuring on top the length of your penis then during intercourse put a hand down there during fullest penetration you can manage and see WHERE on your penis a finger hits How much penis is still outside the vagina Then you will have a pretty good answer as to how much penetration there is it probably best to see a doctor about it More than likely this is a lymph node that is swollen Try warm compresses or soaking in warm bath water 34 times a day for 1520 minutes at a time yea sound like you have a yeast infection id go get checked out girl Dont worry every man wants a tight virgin Any size penis will fit any size vagina The burning and irritation at the time of ejaculation could have to do with the alkalinity of the semen againstwhat used to be a very acidic hostile environment If you are positive that the discharge is indeed coming for the vagina it could also have to do with this burning as it could be what is left after the vag walls are possibly affected by the semen See your doctor right away I had this same issue along with bleeding after intercourse with my husband and I had cancer Go in now prolong your sexual relation and try top riding position during sex surely you get positive result  I wouldnt say that the after effects of child birth would cause a bad odor mostly bad vaginal odors are from infections or poor hygiene Do you or did you have any symptoms of Bacterial Vaginosis Amoxicillin can be helpful with BV but i wouldnt say that it will cure it if you have the symptoms you should go to a doctor and get the proper medication Bacterial Vaginosis Primary Symptoms Vaginal discharge The discharge is usually yellow or green but some women have noticed a gray or even white discharge with BV Vaginal odor The odor is the most common and noticeable symptom which smells fishy If you notice this odor you have Bacterial vaginosis and need to seek treatment After sexual activity The vaginal discharge will be increased with the same odor Bacterial vaginosis Secondary Symptoms Swollen vagina Vaginal itch Pain during sexual intercourse Urination is painful Burning sensation in the vagina Irritation of the vagina I have the same problem and I found out im allergic to latex It is because or the hair regrowing on your vaginal area You may get an infection or you may not get one If there is an injury inside the vagina and the fecal matter got through that injury it is highly possible that you may have an infection The names of the possible infections that may occur are Bacterial Vaginosis and a Vaginal yeast infectionIt is better to consult a gynecologist to run a vaginal wet prep test to ensure everything is alright If you have any symptoms like a sore on your genitals  If you have any symptoms like a sore on your genitals you may undergo laboratory tests to make sure if you have herpes or not Could be several things from the wrong birth control pills to an STDBest to see a Dr if possible 2nd best Planned Parenthood fee based on ability to pay confidential Dont know your situation butI have 4 daughters none of them perfect and they all lived to get grown Your parents might be upset but they probably wouldnt kill you either Good luck kiddo You could be sweating bullets over something smallbest to find out About the Dr problem 8179272737 if these people cant help directly they will know who you can call to get the Dr you need Phone answered 247 If it was your first time it is possible that you have anitcipated the event for so long that you were over excited this is normal for young men keep practicing I might not be the best to answer your question BUT I have experienced this myself when I was 12 I had my FIRST period when I was 12 and it lasted for 3 months I was embarrassed to tell my mom cause I was young and very sheltered and didnt know alot about it back then but once I had big clots I told her and my doctor put me on birth control to stop and regulate my bleeding I know after pregancy blood clots could mean you are hemmorhaging I think its something youll want to call your doctor about because its not normal but Im not sure what causes it I have in the past had what amounted to a pimple in that area before If you can stand it Leave it alone Use cold and heat if it helps If not better in a few days go to the doctor I couldnt stand it Did what you are not supposed to do Instant relief and healing Have found in my 46 years that I am not alone Very common from what I hear Good luck Best wishes My niece had this problem It was a urinary tract infection Get her to the doctor and have her checked right away before she starts presenting with a fever and ends up sicker They can prescribe Antibiotics to help clear it up Sound like urinary tract infection or bladder infection I would see a Dr if it last more than 1 day Outside possibly ovarian cysts depending on the type of sexi would recommend seeing a doctor for a checkup you could be ovulating no  Thank you for the information it was in fact within the last 2 days but as we plan on starting a family soon after we get married in 2 months so if we are we are gonna welcome the blessing from God I was just curious as to whether there was a very high possibility or not thankyou for your answer but its not actually my lips this stuff is like almost like inside no testing was done no yes no no thats very vey unlikely  i think ur in the clear it takes a lot of travel for those lil guys or girls to make their way into the ftubes even with a deep penatration  theres only a 20precent change that a peson whose trying to have a baby will get pregnant also u only ovulate which is the time u make ur egg in the month once a month  so the chances of you being pregnant are very very slim no none  i hope this helped and if u feel like somethings not right go to the doctor  but as for babies u should be safe and remember when u r ready to start making love protect urself before u ever tryif u dont want a baby get urself on the pill to avoid anything unplanned preganacies   yes for sure late peroid is the number one sign of being prego and 2 throughtout all times you will have some kind of mucus  when you ovulate your mucus become clear and sticky like egg whites after that it thickens to stop the sprem form entering you basically a block but  you may experance muces just the same when you are prego a kind of white creamy mucus  also for the pull out method its not at all the same as a pill or patch theres always the chance of precum which as much as he may try to pull out one release of a man can carry millions of little sperm in such a tiny amount precum there a very good chance it could have done the job and precum is something he most likely wont feel nor pull out for and theres more than enough lil ppl in there to get you prego i would buy a hpt  and see what it tells you if it gives you a negative  remember it does depend on how long you have been prego hcg which is what they test for  takes a good two weeks to show  but for you by now i would think it would tell you  if this doesnt go away i would talk to ur gyn  hope this helps  have you tried herbal douches like slippery elm myrhh maybe goldenseal  you will have to mix it yourself I recommend a book called  Back to Eden by Jethro kloss it is a great book Find a good herbal store and find someone who knows herbs From personal experience this may or may not be the same thing youre dealing withI went to the dr for the same thing Apparently people have the Staph bacteria all over their body all the time and usually youre fine but sometimes the bacteria will get balsy or get into tiny openings in the skin and cause what feels like little cuts I was getting them inside my nose for not apparent reason and nothing gets rid of it and then it happened in the same place youre talking about I was prescribed Mupirocin and it went away in about 3 days sounds like an yeast infection try getting stuff to treat that and go from there hope this helps  Unfortunately you may very well have genital herpes The medication your ex is taking is most likely an antiviral medication such as Valtrex or its generic version This medicaion only surpresses the outbreaks and makes an outbreak shorter in duration It does not cure herpes or stop it from spreading to another person A person who has herpes can spread it to another even when they do not have any current blisters or visual signs of an outbreak I would recommend getting a blood test That way you know for sure Also remember that each persons body reacts differently to the virus Some people get outbreaks often and they can be painful and itchy Others get an outbreak only once every few years and they are mild It all depends on your body Good Luck First off Antibiotics are not used to treat a yeast infection Actually for some women they can cause a yeast infection A yeast infection can be treated with an oral pill called Diflucan It has to be prescribed by a doctor I recommend going to the doctor Explain that you are a virgin and that you know it is not an STD The doctor should be able to go by the symptoms you describe and give you what is needed While you are there feel free to talk about a pelvic exam and what you should expect when you are ready to get one Good Luck Please see a gynecologist ASAP There are several over the counter douches you can use but I would Sounds like a yeast infection to me Monistat 3 saved my life I couldnt sleep and was at the point of tears Experiencing those symptoms were the worst and I broke down until I asked an MA that I worked with She recommended this treatment I googled it and was TERRIFIED at the responses that it was worse to use than the actual condition itself But I buckled down and said it really cant be any worse than this I and the MA was right Nothing burned or felt worse Just relief Every day after got better and better I am finishing day 3 of monistat and I feel back to normal I am thankful I didnt pay attention to the bad reviews I feel like people come online more so to bash their bad experience with it because it didnt help them and those that it did help they dont find a need to let others know because they are over the hurdle Thats why Im posting People need to know that its not scary and that its NORMAL And extremely uncomfortable But that this product WORKS The symptoms I had were as follows paper cut feeling on the labia burning on the inside of the vagina and sleeplessness due to extreme discomfort The only thing I did differently than what the box recommended was using calmoseptine cream on the outside for the itching and burning instead of the cream in the box Calmo has a menthol release and was the only thing that helped The monistat ointment that came with the 3 was bogus and made it burn like crazy Calmo is used for a wide variety of skin issues such as this and medical professionals seem to think this okay to use for this condition to get relief I didnt consult with one before using it and it got me though the majority of my day Just remember to cleanse and reapply frequently and use less as it gets better because skin needs to breathe Good luck to you all and seek medical attention if you have a fever or any other out of the ordinary symptoms for yeast infection Other than that get to your nearest Rite Aide or other pharmacy provider and get Monistat for relief Just remember that 1 is the most potent and 7 is the least and if you are prone to more sensitivity go with the longer treatment God speed My husband and I use Wild Wipes and we love them Wild Wipes are intimate wipes for men and women theyre really soft and smell really nice Their website is wwwwildwipescom and if you use promo code wild you get free shipping too My sister had a kidney infection and when she urinated she would bleed So do you think this blood you see is coming from your unrinary tract and not your vagina I would call your doctor either way no Vaginosis could be another cause yes I was taken off of estrogen without a gradual stop just kind of cold turkey I had one intercourse experience after a year of being off estrogen and the odor came My general health care provider could not help me I found a Gynocologist who would see me I was turned down by one who said I was too old He put me on Vagifem and it cleared up That was three years ago The experience was very traumatic You might as not even be on the pill if you have unprotected sex within 24 hours Like most pills it takes a while to take effect in your system Good rule of thumb is allow a month from time started for it to enter and take effect in your system Until then us a condom sperm lives for 20minutes to an hour outside vagina yes it will tighten that area I guarentee you contract and relax those muscles repeatedly 7 to 10 times then hold tightlycontract for as long as you can while sitting at a stop light in your car at the office watching tv or when ever you think about it and you will notice results quickly and so will your partner if you cant always do it for that long of a time or that many reps dont worry any added amount will make a difference i think if u got genital herpes thats about as bad as its gonna get Shingles is worse Get a Shingles shot every year  they have one at most pharmacies Also check your immunological system It could be a skin tag Best thing is to go and see a doctor and he will let you know and if you want to get rid of it they will let you know what you need to do I have a daughter 5 and 3 other girls and am actually a nurse and was on looking for answers to bladder issues myself anyway it sounds like she is either rushing or if u have been there with her and now 4 sure she may need her bladder checked maybe for a urinary tract infection I was doing that with no other symptoms and got on here when spasms or pain like pinching started Because I have fibromyalgia but also went thru alot of terribly stressful things in my life and spousal abuse yrs ago so drs say at 36 i may be going thru menopause and i get on here to see all my health issues could be causing my problem its horrible and i feel for ur little one thats irritating and u may have her bladder checked by ultrasound and a urine screen for infection Hope she feels better soon if it gets terribly bad and untreated and i am a nurse and was on looking up something for myself and thought id help yes it can be bladder infectionurinary tract infection was just on here looking up symptoms of same thing but with pinching like spasms constant and i am a nurse Hi I am 31 years old Premature ejaculation is more common than you think up to 40 of all males experience this in their lifetime I personally overcame my issues with premature ejaculation by following these very helpful tips If interested please click here httpwwwbuyduramalecom I hope it helps you as well as it did for me Most women statistically do NOT have orgasms when the have intercourse or with any penetration I am one of these women but what works with me is playing with or using a vibrator on the clitoris while having sex Most women can orgasm from clitoris stimulation sounds like a physician diagnosis is needed for possible signs and symptoms of human papilloma virus yes relax and experiment on yourself your partners vagina is not producing enough moisture and should be checked by her obgyn the friction from the condom is rubbing her inner walls causing them to bleed I think so yes In addition I have found that if your legs are in good shape because you exercise regulary then it tends to tighten up your pelvic floor muscles to Just my own personal experience of course what can I do about it drink lots of waterlike 5 litres a day do Kegel exercisesyou will be like you were beforeand for the mean time use lots of lubes while having sex Go to a doctor what are you waiting for have you tried lubricant it could be too dry I HAVE spotting and cramps after total hysterectomy 12 years ago No blood clots or lumps Is very hurtful when I tried to put finger in it just barely goes in and comes you with a pinkred stain no signs of discharge Sperm can swim Male sperm are fast and furious while Female sperm are slower but live longer and stick around longer If your cervical mucus is thin and stretchy and if you arent using excessive lubricants I am positive that not penetrating deeply is no problem at all In fact some experts associate less deep ejaculations with female children as the male sperm die before reaching their destination Is it possible that you conceived Implantation of a fertilized egg can cause bleedingcramping at the same time a woman expects her period It is typically lighter than a regular period but can last a day or two It could mean that you are pregnant If you have had any other major changes medication birth control major stress weight loss etc this could also be another explanation I suppose I would wait another 45 days and take a pregnancy test if conception was possible It could be an STD You may want to get tested possibly kidney infection or kidney stones idk about the ichyness I dont know about a day or two later but if you have sex and she doesnt shower or otherwise wash the semen out she will have a strong genital odor for most of the day Your genitals smell too after sex On the other hand an odor for more than a day and after washing could indicate something like a urinary or yeast infection "}
