{"text": "I would practice breathing techniques to help me relax on a daily bases  it could mean that you are pregnantbetter go to your doctor and do a test and make sure An otherwise healthy person who gets the flu will usually improve over two to five days In some people that tired feeling may last for one week or more and very rarely the symptoms can last for several weeks post influenza asthenia A major concern when you get the flu is that complications can arise This is not strictly a relapse but the development of another illness The risk is highest for those with diabetes heart lung or kidney disease and other chronic diseases that lower the bodys resistance to infection Persons over age 65 are also at greater risk of developing complications from the flu A very serious complication associated with the flu is pneumonia Shortness of breath sharp chest pain on deep breathing or fever lasting beyond five days are symptoms that may indicate pneumonia Talk with your doctor if your symptoms are not improving It is always better to wait until you are feeling better before starting back on a vigorous exercise program It is normal to feel weak for several days after the flu but if your symptoms persist seek medical attention to be safe I went through all the test in the hospital I was told I had a heart of a 27 year old My doctor did not believe the test as he could not control my blood pressure They went in and found a blockagewidow maker They did a stent Surgeon stated I would have been dead within 30 days So much for test You can try red yeast rice and naicin Naicin taken twice a day can lower according to my doctor I take both and my readings are 9072 Try it capsules do not cost very much Have the doctor do a blood check for herpes  Panic disorder is suspected to be caused by genetic traits an overly sensitive personality major life stressors or brain changes that make you susceptible to stress Yes inform your family doctor of these attacks regardless The family doctor has to be that one person within whom you can totally trust with your health and yes your health related secrets Youre right most psychiatric doctors prescribe medication and provide very little talk treatment You do not necessarily have to see a psychiatrist and be prescribed medication to achieve resolution of painic episodes I recommend that you see a mental health therapist  counselor that specializes in panic disorders andor cognitive therapy techniques This individual may see you once per week at the beginning and can help in removing the stimulating thoughts that may trigger attacks Sometimes within a few weeks to one month youll see significant improvement Other methods to eliminate the symptoms of panic disorder may include seeing a hypnotherapist and attending a support group for this conditionThe support group can listen to your story in a nonjudgmental fashion and offer you suggestions on their successful methods used to treat the disorder The group may also provide you with some loyal and lasting friendships Panic disorder symptoms can be reduced and totally eliminated by working with the correct therapist and by maintaining a positive outlook You have not revealed your age or given specific details relating to your angry and fearful feelings Despite the limited information provided with your question it is easy to conclude that you are not happy I will honestly give you my impression of your symptoms If you are a minor then describe your feelings to your parents and request their advice If you cannot talk with parents then seekout a responsible family member or trusted adult and decide on a course of action I respectively suggest that you start out by having a talk with your family doctor and a complete physical examination If your medical profile turnsout to be satisfactory then a mental health evaluation is justified The way that you feel is suggestive of a mood disorder It is not your fault Some folks have chemical imbalances that cause emotional pain anger frustration fear hostility and depression A therapist may be consulted to determine a diagnosis establish a treatment plan and may consult with a psychiatrist to determine if medication is needed Talking about your feelings to a neutral confidant is in itself therapeutically beneficial With proper supportsyou can stop those negative feelings of anger and fear You deserve nothing less than to experience a happy life A phobia may be defined as a persistent irrational fear of a specific object activity or situation that leads to a compelling desire to avoid it I dont know how old you are as some phobias will just disappear over time Although the fear may seem very irrational to many of us Im sure that it is perceived as very real to you Dont allow well intentioned people to tell you just get over it Additionally you must move forward to overcome this fear for you and not for other people Like most phobias they can be overcome with the therapeutic help of a professional and hard work on your part The following are some suggestions have your blood drawn in the company of a loyal friend or family member to receive necessary emotional support visit with a trained psychologist who will work on you at your own pace with the goal of acclimating you mentally for the procedure Hypnosis therapy can also be helpful with difficult cases Investigate some of the clinical laboratories in your area and research for the most competent technician to draw your blood All labs and their technicians do not possess equal skills My experience has shown me that the largest and busiest labs usually do the best blood draws This is because it is all that they do on their job for every day of their working week They take blood from heavy folks think folks the very young the old and the very frail and very ill It stands to reason that they become superlike specialist at their task Tell the lab about your fears and ask for their recommendations They may assign you to their best lab worker with the best blood drawing skills and patient demeanor Sometimes using a blood draw setup designed for babies and children is also beneficial These kits have smaller gauge needles and can make the difference between a painful arm stick and a barely feel it stick Your victory over this fear will most likely be won in small doses of success Remember a long voyage begins with the first step Most phobias are overcome by dealing with then directly If your were fearful of public speaking Id suggest that you join a speakers club In your case I recommend that you volunteer at a nearby hospital or nursing home Perhaps someone in the neighborhood could use your assistance with their incapacitated relative Helping a sick or elderly patient to bath and preparing them for bed would be a positive step to overcoming your fear of the human body I am referring to your uncomfortable feelings as a phobia because blood fluids and internal organs are normal human being substances Even diseased or infected body products if handled properly do not represent a threat to you The worst doctors that Ive encountered were the ones who talked to me from across the room They would look at my inflamed throat at an arms distance and avoid touching me If you really want to become not just a doctor  but a good doctor then touching the patients is imperative Touching is an essential diagnostic tool and shows your sincere interest in the patient as a person YES you shouldI acquired some symptoms of this sort a couple of years back and it turned out to be a severe infection of my urinary tract I AM WONDERING DOES SHE GET REALLY ANXIOUS BECAUSE SHE IS AROUND A LOT OF PEOPLE WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE AROUND THE TIME I LOST A SON TO SIDS I HAD PANIC ATTACKS QUITE OFTEN IN A CLASSROOM SETTING I WANTED TO BAIL OUT OF CLASS EVERY TIME I COULD TELL THAT OTHER STUDENTS WERE WATCHING ME PROBABLY THINKING I WAS CRAZY WHICH JUST STRESSED ME OUT MORE I PERSONALLY DO NOT WANT TO BE TOUCHED DURING ONE AND I WANT TO BE LEFT ALONE I SEEM TO HOLLER AT SOMEONE TRYING TO CALM ME DOWN IF YOUR FRIEND IS DIFFERENT THAN ME DONT TRY TO MAKE HER STAY IN CLASS THAT WILL JUST MAKE IT WORSE BUT I HAVE A FRIEND WHO RECENTLY HAD HER FIRST ATTACK AND I GAVE HER A PAPER BAG WHICH I KEEP ON ME FOR MY ATTACKS DONT KNOW IF YOUR FRIENDS HAS TRIED THAT BECAUSE WE SEEM TO HYPERVENTILATE WHILE HAVING ONE I JUST KEPT TELLING MY FRIEND TO TRY AND BREATHE NORMALLY WITH THE BAG AND I KEPT TELLING HER THAT SHE WILL BE OKAY IN A LITTLE BIT THAT THIS SPELL WILL SOON GO AWAY AND SHE WILL FEEL BETTER I HAVE JUST LEARNED FROM MD THAT HER HOT FLASHES MAY NOT BE THE CHANGE OF LIFE IT MAY BE THE ONSET OF A PANIC ATTACK Severe psychological events can potentially cause hallucinations but I think its rather uncommon for a panic attack to do so It would not be impossible however for you to have the panic attack first and the hallucination to begin afterwards Its possible that you simply noticed the visual disturbance the physical sensation of being afraid and that coming down from the panic left you physically or emotionally tired I would recommend that you tell someone if this happens again since a lot of other things can cause hallucinations Its possible that this was an isolated incident but it never hurts to be sure  These books I have found to be very resourceful The Statin Damage Crisis By Duane Graveline MD The Great Cholestrol Myth By Jonny Bowden PHCNS and How Statin Drugs Really Lower Cholesterol James B Yoseph and Hannah Yoseph MD I urge you to do your research carefully My Lipase levels were higher than that and it was because of gall stones At first it felt like I had gas that wouldnt pass I had my gall bladder removed and within 3 mos I was back to normal For your any dental problem plz click here  confidentdentalcare  For your any dental problem click here  confidentdentalcare every doctor and everytime i got to the sexual health center they say its nothing and i have a anxiety problem i look at the internet for Std symptoms and stuff doctors say not to do that but im still scared and worried  Please help After months of antibiotics the wound continued until it became MRSA aka Folliculitis I feel it has become worse with lumps in the back of my neck The Hospital gave me the topical Mupirocin I will keep you informed There are mixed feelings on this medicine but from what I have heard it is not good to use since MS effects the nerves  There is a possibility of an exacerbation so I am NOT taking it  Im sorry to hear youre going through this Anxiety is no fun no matter what causes it I suggest you investigate CBT This type of therapy is issuebased and is designed to help resolve issues like yours quite quickly  often in four to five sessions If that sounds impossible take it from me It can happen In a nutshell cognitive behavioral therapy helps you recognize the early symptoms of in your case an anxiety episode coming on so that you can disrupt your bodys physical response to the trigger You already know your trigger heights Since you cant avoid the trigger CBT will teach you how to change your thought patterns and behaviors to derail the panic attack before it can get started It sounds easy and it actually can be easy  with some practice You can find many therapists who specialize in CBT I urge you to find one and get started soon because theres no reason for you to continue limiting your life and experiencing the nasty symptoms of a panic attack for even one more day Wishing you well Well Im not going to sugarcoat it A isnt the most pleasant experience youll ever have On the other hand its not as painful as say a big incision in your abdomen Based on feedback from male friends who have had a cystoscopy I can tell you they describe the discomfort of the procedure as pinching and pressure They say its not so bad they felt they would have preferred sedation especially since the procedure only takes a few minutes According to my friends the discomfort lasts about an hour or so but theres no pain or burning on urination afterwards For the  you probably will have a urinary foley catheter placed and then your bladder will be filled with fluid In my experience as a nurse many men have told me the sensation of having a catheter placed was quite uncomfortable Those who could relax and focus their attention elsewhere seemed to tolerate the procedure better And that is my advice to you As much as possible focus your attention on your breathing Take long slow deep breaths Focus on making your navel belly button rise and fall It may sound wackadoodle but this relaxation technique really does work Also try to hold a mental image in your mind of you walking out of the clinic getting into your car and driving home This will help remind you the discomfort is only temporary and soon will be over with I know youll breeze through these procedures just fine Wishing you well I would suggest you get this looked at by a health care provider Id recommend starting with your primary health care provider as opposed to a dermatologist The symptoms you describe could be caused by an allergic reaction as you suspected but they could also signal something else such as infected hair follicles cysts or other disorders If theres an infection involved youll need to get it treated or it wont clear up Thats why I suggest you consult your primary health care provider first Youre right to be concerned about this though I wouldnt panic by any means If possible take some photos of the rash or outbreak in case you cant get an appointment while youre experiencing the problem Take care The key phrase in your question is this I was playing video games at the time Since the numbness is confined to the tip of your thumb chances are youre suffering from a repetitive motion injury Any activity that involves the same movement of the hands and fingers over and over again can cause irritation of the nerves that supply them In the extreme this can cause loss of movement and severe pain In your case it sounds like you may have irritated a nerve that carries sensory impulses to the brain That tiny nerve ending apparently has stopped working The good news is if this is indeed a repetitve motion injury you can improve the situation by resting your hand for awhile Avoid playing any video games and see if the situation improves If not see your health care provider for further evaluation Just to be clear the in men generally include a crushing or squeezing sensation in the middle of the chest chest pain pain or numbness radiating down the left arm andor into the left jaw shortness of breath faintness or nausea And dont think just because youre only 19 years old that a heart attack would be out of the question While its unlikely a heart attack can strike people of almost any age particularly if theyre sedentary andor overweight Im sorry to hear youre feeling anxious about your and how it might affect your sexual performance And I want to assure you your feelings are perfectly normal I think all men go through a period of insecurity regarding their penis size Society puts a lot of emphasis on this particular aspect of masculinity after all I hasten to assure you that your penis probably is perfectly normal in size But your best bet to completely set your mind at ease about the situation is to make an appointment with a urologist He or she can examine you and tell you if everythings OK Also you may be surprised to learn that medically speaking penis size isnt measured based on the erect organ Rather penis size is measured by stretched penis length The article I linked above will give you a lot of information about average penis length how to measure your penis and when to see a doctor I hope this helps set your mind at ease Im sorry to hear youre going through this Feeling as if a surgery didnt work is never a good thing You dont describe any symptoms that lead you to the feeling one side of your inguinal hernia repair was unsuccessful Is the surgical site feeling hard Painful If so these may be normal issues at six months after surgery For instance as scar tissue builds up it can cause a surgical incision to feel hard Also small nerves that were cut during the surgery may cause pain especially burning stinging pain as they wake up This process can take weeks to months Im not a lawyer and cannot give legal advice which is essentially what youre asking for However a surgeon is never obligated to perform additional surgeries on a patient even if theyre considered by the patient as corrective I urge you to discuss your concerns directly with your surgeon As a former surgical nurse Ive never known a surgeon who was not eager to make sure his patients were satisfied If you feel your concerns are not being heard by your original surgeon by all means get a second opinion Like I said many issues that patients interpret as problems after surgery actually are part of the normal healing process Healing from surgery doesnt occur in a week or a month Depending on each persons individual medical history surgical healing can take many months And by the way its not uncommon for one side of a bilateral surgery to heal at a different pace than the other side Wishing you well Youve done the right thing by coming here and asking about your phobia because actually this is exactly the type of fear that can be overcome Youve already taken the first two crucial steps to overcoming this phobia 1 Identifying it 2 Asking for help The next step I advise you to take is to contact a counselor or psychotherapist You may be pleased to learn that advances in treating phobias over the past couple of decades have made it possible for many people to overcome their fear of things like needles in just a few sessions with a therapist Obviously the length of treatment time will vary with each individual But my goal here is to reassure you that you need not believe youll need a lifetime of psychotherapy to overcome this Its probably not true at all You obviously understand how important it is to get an annual blood draw especially at your age Our analysis of peoples blood allows us to detect all kinds of medical conditions that may require treatment And please dont feel awkward or ashamed about approaching a therapist for help with your issue This is not an uncommon fear and any medical professional will admire you for finally coming to terms with your phobia and wanting to conquer it I wish you all the best If youre talking about cleaning out your childrens ear canals then my advice is dont Many people get overzealous about cleaning inside the ear In truth its not necessary is produced naturally by the body to help protect the ear canal It normally will work its way from the inner part of the canal to the outer part of the ear where you can wipe it away with a damp towel Using a cotton swab or any other implement to clean inside the ear can push the wax back into the ear or even rupture the eardrum All you need to do to clean a childs ears is take a soft damp cloth a gently wipe the part of the ear that you can see Its as simple as that I hope this helps Its definitely possible to experience real physical symptoms from emotions So yes that sick feeling in the stomach could be a true physical symptom of your guilty feelings Stress can produce many physical symptoms from a racing heart to dermatitis Some peoples bodies are very sensitive to emotion and express those emotions through physical symptoms Im sorry youre going through this and suggest you get counseling to help relieve both your feelings of guilt and the physical symptoms those feelings are causing Best wishes to you Im sorry youre feeling worried about this Let me see if I can help First of all Id strongly recommend you discuss your concerns with your doctor He or she is in the best position to help get you on a course to lower your cholesterol and triglyceride numbers and get your blood sugar under better control Diet medications and a support group can all help in that effort Regarding the result of your  specifically Im not sure why a result of 90 would get flagged as high Usually the reference range for lipase runs between 1040 units per liter UL for adults under age 60 and between 18180 UL for adults over age 60 Even if your lipase results are abnormally high I wouldnt jump right to a conclusion of cancer Several conditions can cause elevated lipase numbers including inflammation of the pancreas pancreatitis gallbladder problems and peptic ulcers  just to name a few Your doctor is really the only person who can help you get an accurate diagnosis but I hope this response puts your mind at ease a bit Best wishes to you You need to seek immediate medical attention What youre describing could be a symptom of a or  Either one needs to be treated quickly Obviously the only way to properly diagnose this problem is to see a healthcare provider preferably an ophthalmologist Please call one as soon as possible and describe your symptoms so they will get you a prompt appointment I wish you all the best with this Sorry youre worried about this I can understand it though If Im understanding you correctly youre saying you havent yet started your period despite being 18 years old Thats the premise Im going to go on The onset of menstruation   can vary widely in terms of age However most girls do get their period by age 15 or 16 If youve seen an gynecologist and he or she told you you were healthy then I would urge you not to worry Its possible youre just a late bloomer If its been some time since you saw the gynecologist then you might consider going back for a recheck just to make sure everythings still OK I mean if you saw a gynecologist at age 16 but havent seen one since or something Meanwhile just hang in there If your gynecologist gave you a clean bill of health then you can expect to start your period any time All the best to you You are a good person to want to help your friend with her condition It can be hard to help someone in the moment of a panic attack One thing you can do is offer to hold her hand and breathe together Before attempting this you should practice slow deep breathing on your own so that in the moment of the panic attack you can help your friend regulate her breathing Dont get frustrated if she is unable to breathe as slowly as you are Merely staying calm and encouraging her softly to breathe in23 and breathe out23 can be helpful You may actually be able to help your friend better by finding an activity such as yoga that the two of you can do together when shes not having a panic attack Regular exercise can help anxiety in general and yoga specifically focuses on breathing By offering to do yoga with your friend youre supporting her in fighting the anxiety problem Your friend should be grateful she has you in her life Good luck to both of you I think youre referring to the fact people with blood sugar problems can be slow to heal Thats why foot care is so important for people with diabetes Preventing sores is better than trying to heal them If your blood sugar is wellcontrolled through diet andor medications you should have nothing to fear from a boil You probably will heal just fine If your blood sugar is not wellcontrolled then you would be wise to work harder at this Make sure youre doing everything within your power to eat a healthy diet get some exercise take your diabetes medications lose weight and so on Some people with diabetes never get their sugars under control but most people can do it with some discipline and willpower If the boil is giving you discomfort and needs to be drained by a health care provider dont hesitate to make an appointment That way you can also get instructions on to best care for the wound so it heals well Wishing you well I think youre referring to the fact people with blood sugar problems can be slow to heal Thats why foot care is so important for people with diabetes Preventing sores is better than trying to heal them If your blood sugar is wellcontrolled through diet andor medications you should have nothing to fear from a boil You probably will heal just fine If your blood sugar is not wellcontrolled

provider dont hesitate to make an appointment That way you can also get instructions on to best care for the wound so it heals well Wishing you well Having a retained object in the rectum is no laughing matter I understand why youd feel scared Women face similar feelings about retaining tampons so you definitely are not alone If youre very concerned that the condom is still inside you your best bet is to seek medical attention Let me assure you any health care professional worth their salt will treat your problem with dignity and concern You need not feel embarrassed about this If an otherwise healthy person were constipated and retaining stool in the rectum the obvious answer would be to use a liquidbased laxative such as magnesium citrate or polyethylene glycol brand name MiraLax However anyone with any medical condition compromised immune system or dehydration should not use these preparations without medical supervision If you experience any abdominal bloating vomiting or fever please seek medical attention immediately Good luck to you My best answer is You should not discontinue without consulting your physician A stress test alone cannot tell you there is no build up of plaque in your arteries Im glad your stress test result was good but your total number is a bit high Its not outrageous though and that fact warrants a discussion with your physician If your health care provider feels you need to be on a cholesterollowering drug there are many alternatives to simvastatin Your provider can advise you how to discontinue the simvastatin and start a new medication if needed You might also check out to see how others have handled their borderline high cholesterol issues what medications they take and how they talked to their doctor about their choices of cholesterollowering drugs Take care If youre concerned about having surgery why not get a second opinion Doctors dont take it personally when patients do that And it might give you peace of mind to hear another doctors take on your situation Your doctor can explain better than anyone what it means that your spleen is swollen inflamed and has nodules on it because he or she has seen the films such as the results of an ultrasound exam CT scan or MRI and lab results Id suggest you schedule another appointment and take a written list of questions Your doctor will be happy to explain exactly whats going on and why he or she wants to remove your spleen an operation that is called   People can live normal lives without a spleen Ask you doctor about possible complications from the surgery It should not slow you down though its true people without a spleen are somewhat more susceptible to develop infections like the flu Your doctor can explain what it will be like to live without a spleen Best of luck to you his pediatrician has referred to a pediatric orthopedic doctor we have not gone yet i just dont want any surprises and to be educated on any choices i may have to make or treatment he may receive httppregnancyaboutcomodamipregnantamissedperiodhtm this should help out but if I were you Id buy a pregnancy test theres some at the dollar store for 1 They work Im not a dr but have you gone to one to see if there is a medical reason to explain this My friends daughter is 13 and weighs 230 pounds I was keeping her for awhile and decided to help her lose some of the weight The first thing I did was not allow her to make her own plate She thought she knew about portion sizes but really she was putting way too much food on her plate A sample breakfast could be a scrambled egg with some spinach a meat for protein 1 sausage and a glass of orange juice Or since youre young you might only have cereal for an option so pick a cereal thats healthy and without all that sugar An ex could be Kashi or something like raisin bran The second thing I did was teach her about nutrition Her mom is 300 pounds so I knew there was no one there who knew either If you ball your hand into a fist thats the size of your stomach Thats how much food can actually fit Anymore than that then youre stretching your stomach out The more you cut back on eating the more your stomach goes back to the size its supposed to be Third which should probably be first but I wanted to get her eating habits down first is exercise exercise exercise You have to exercise Skipping at school or PE isnt enough I walked with her everyday for 30 minutes She didnt think she could do it but I stood by her every step of the way and encouraged her We were even able to start doing it twice a day Hopefully at some point we can speed walk then start jogging Fourth you have to drink tons of water Sometimes your body might feel like its hungry when youre actually thirsty A good rule of thumb is to start off with64 ounces a day To help you measure use a plastic water bottle to fill your cupsglasses and thats how you can keep track Fifth which should probably be higher is to make sure you eat enough healthy foods I made her eat 2 servings of vegetables with every meal Her snacks were fruit Also a good time to say eat 57 small meals everyday and when I say small I mean the size of your fist small I seriously doubt your taking this will stunt the growth of your penis You could always pull up the medication on line and get a full list of all the side effects it causes This can be done privately with no embarrassment to you at all Many young teens have been on medications of this type for years now and it is very common to prescribe these drugs to children with Adhd These medicatons have now been on the market for so very many years and I would think by now you would have heard if that was in fact one of the side effects of this medication or other similar type medications I can certainly understand your concern however and I know at 16 yrs of age this is a very sensitive scary thing for you to consider I would suggest you simply ask your doctor and you can of course do that but I suspect you are a bit embarrassed to bring up the subject with your physicianalthough you have no reason to be I do understand that most likely it is not something you want to discuss openly with anyone So I suggest you look up the medication on line and get a complete list of any and all side effects You can do this from the privacy of your home with your computer or you can simply go to your pharmacy and tell them you want a complete detailed printout of all side effects that could result from taking your medicine They will be happy to provide you with a copy of any and all side effects without asking you any questions at all as to why you want a copy of this I feel after you have read all the side effects in privacy and see that stunting the growth of your penis is not one of them you will feel much better You are too young to have this worry on your mind when it can easily be taken care of discreetly and privately Good luck to you Do a test personally I have had false negatives in the past but a false positive is rare good luck x There are several recipes that can be found on the WebMD website I have included links to and  When looking at the ingredients of a recipe feel free to alter to fit within your diet regimen I have also included a link about the to help you choose foods that are lower in cholesterol Hi I m not a cardiologist or anything but due to my experience with anxiety I can tell you that it had caused my heart to beat so fast that it made my chest hurt and I felt short of breath To answer your question to the best of my knowledge arteries do not go from normal to clogged in 7 months unless you have risks such as family history of heart disease not being active and eating unhealthy foods high in salt and fat I would recommend however to call up your cardiologist and ask for yourself to get checked out again just to be sure I have this problem on occasion even though I dont have low blood sugar normally I suggest you eat a piece of candy that isnt sugar free or maybe just grab a soda or some sweet tea and drink that and see if the sensation doesnt go away fairly quickly Dry sockets are usually caused by sucking on straws or something of that nature I have had friends come back to school as early as 2 days later I would wait until the anesthesia is completely worn off and the pain is well under control But remember that the mouth is the fastest healing place on the body So you should be feeling better soon I am not a doctor however I would like to share my experience with lemon juice and stomach bugs I have been using lemon juice to prevent the stomach bug for several years now We have NEVER caught the stomach bug while using fresh squeezed lemon juice I will share our regimen once exposed we drink an ounce of fresh lemon juice twice a day for TEN days We make it into lemonade for our kids One of my daughters decided she didnt want lemon juice on day 5 and by that evening she was sick The rest of us started over again and drank lemonade for another 10 days and we were fine Since this one incident my kids never ever stop drinking their lemonade in fact they remind me to get it for them It has been 100 percent effective for us Well I have to say when the WHI study came out in 2002 it was insane what they did with this research and how they presented it to women I remember I was dealing with WebMD at that point and coming on line and talking to all the women and telling them not to stop their hormones if anything to switch over to the natural progesterone But what had happened was the study was really done on synthetic hormones and women who started 10 years after the fact always my recommendation to women when they go on hormone replacement therapy they do it around the perimenopause when they are having the maximum symptoms that they take it for menopausal symptoms and they take the least amount they need to control their symptoms and for the shortest amount of time that they need to take it so that they are not getting into twenty years down the line of continuous hormonal replacement therapy and getting into trouble with breast cancer Im not sure but i heard of  Exposure therapy which is a form of cognitivebehavioral therapy It involves putting yourself into increasingly stressful scenarios involving your particular phobia and overcoming your fear with new learning Theres different kinds of talk and of course the effectiveness of any therapy is critically dependent on who you are working with It would be possible if the gooey substance was indeed sperm but its unlikely for there to be sperm on a razor You might suffer on urinary incontinance you should visit urologist There are differnt treatments one of them is to take special drug called Amitriptiline which closes the bladder neck during the night and this way you dont have such accidents Only your urologist can treat this conditionand prescribe the medication Amitriptilane is used for young wet blatters and at the same time antidepressant for children  That fact that you lost that much weight in less than a week tells me that its mostly fluid and not actual fat or muscle It would be impossible to figure out the reason for this based on the information you have provided The best thing to do is to let your parents know and see your primary healthcare provider to find out what is going on If it is something like diabetes which can cause sudden weight loss the sooner you get help the better The scary part is not knowing Dont delay Not answering my own question but would like to clarify what kind of person I am I have this thing where peer pressure doesnt work on me regardless of who it is Ex Never done drugs took a sip of alcohol and that was that nasty stuff I think Im allergic to it in fact still a virgin at 20 I have no pressure when it comes to my actions if I dont want to do it I dont do it if I do then I do Im asking for help not relationship advice 23 months is a safe time to get checked to make sure you dont have HIV It all depends on where your hand went after you touched her and does she have HIV There is a possiblility that you could get HIV But it seems very low with that being said if you know your partner might have somthing You both should be checked before making sexual contact just to be safe Im so sorry to hear about your daughter How old is your daughter Please dont get offended if I ask  is there any possibility she cannot remember the number because there is something she doesnt want you to see I only ask because Ive lived through the teenage years with two children Medically speaking for the last year I have had a problem passing out and then doing things that have even harmed me and I have no memory of doing these things Lots of bloody noses I have been to a Neurologist for a brain MRI have had an EEG to rule out seizures and right now Im being treated by a Sleep Specialist This last episode that I had in October propelled me very quickly back to the doctor I hurt myself pretty severely I hope this helps in some way If not I apologize Feel free to ask me anything back I hope she is doing better very

taking progestinonly pills it is crucial that you take the pill at the same time every day Taking it three hours later than usual may make it ineffective and you will need to use a back up method for at least 48 hours Missing means you forget to take your pill for 24 hours or you never take it at all In some cases your doctor may have been right to tell you that youre unprotected for that month but it depends on the week and the type of pill For combination pills pills that have both estrogen and progestin if you miss one pill during week one you should use backup for at least 7 days assuming you take the missed pill as soon as your remember even if it means taking two pills at once During weeks two three and four you may not need backup if you take the pill once you remember however this can vary by brand At any point in your cycle miss two or more pills and youll probably need backup Confused yet Its important that you read the label on your pill very carefully and if youre in doubt use condoms or other back up Do hope this helps Good Luck Hi At 13 this is not good for you tell your Mum you need to go to the doctors ASAP tell her why you are in need of this 24 days

help you both Although they are not infectious and arent related in any way to sexual activity and personal hygiene the papules can still be worrying for those who dont know what they are and who may mistake them as an STI Men with PPP should not pick them or attempt to squeeze them as this could lead to scarring and infection It is possible to have the papules removed for cosmetic reasons which dermatologists may do by using a CO2 laser to vaporise the spots This does not involve any injections in the penis as an anaesthetic cream can be used and men will be fully healed within one to two weeks It is important to remember that despite this being a safe and effective procedure removal is not obligatory It is often opted for by people who are finding that the papules are affecting their selfconfidence Do hope this helps you Good Luck Hi The chances of getting pregnant from anal sex is like nil shes on the BC pill Im sure if anyone would be worried it would be her look your acting

22 years old and have never had my period When I think about it for too long I do start to think the worst but i feel perfectly fine so I am not worried I did ask around and did some research and

opinion from another doctor if the problem hasnt changed Oral contraceptives are very effective at preventing pregnancy If you have been taking your pill daily as directed then you should not become pregnant You should not take any extra pills as this will affect your cycle and will not decrease your chances of becoming pregnant You should continue to take one pill a day Sounds like paranormal activity I have worked with many men and women who demonstrate a fear of food The root cause is psychological and often resonates around control issues complicated by anxiety and depression Youre already quite thin yet you want to drop fat and weight Why Think back to when you made that decision It sounds as though youve had the fear for a while and that you may already be a chronic food restrictor Im quite concerned about your desire to shed weight You absolutely should be working with a therapist who is expert in eating disorders These experts will help you tease apart your unique situation and develop a strategy to create a healthier relationship with food Go to the web site for the International Associaton of Eating Disorder Professionals and find a therapist in your location You really need to speak with someone as soon as possible if you cant find anyone see your doctor and let your medical team find someone for you Did you partner have HIVif not lotion will not give it to you But if she does have it I dont know why you would have sex but that is just me talking I would hope so but I would research it on this site or call the doc that did the surgery I cant imagine them rupturing but I am not a doc good luck There are excersizes that will enlarge thickness and length They do work It is a slow process but it can be done Also some of the enlargement drugs that is on the market do enlarge by increasing the blood flow and amount that the penis will tolerate Again its a slow process but it is possible There are also excersizes to allow you to last for very long time before you climax that really turns your mate on Also with time you will learn to satisify the woman and not yourself If you strive to satisify your mate she will hold on for life and do the same for you If you are lucky enough to find a virgin to marry someday God will match you perfectly Im gonna guess they are Fordyces spots Check out this link This is exactly what it looks like on my penis I freaked out too but its nothing An endoscopy test sounds horrible but it really is easy I was also scared before I had my test The procedure was performed in a I had the same problem severely a few years ago almost every day to the point that I had to retire early I improved quite a bit years ago with the help of a service dog who could sense when I was about to have an attack and alert me to take antianxiety medicine before the attack happened However what really helped me at first was to take prophylactic medication until my generalized level of anxiety decreased I did relaxation desensitization therapy and other relaxation methods like yoga but it wasnt until the attacks reduced that any of it helped In the meantime the best thing you can do for your friend is to help her with a solution for her REAL fear  vomiting in public Encourage her to carry a plastic ziploc bag in her purse so if she does get sick she wont make a mess that others will have to deal with and tell her if she feels that she is going to be sick in public you will help her get to a private place to be sick if necessary There is also an overthecounter medication called Emetrol that will calm the vomiting reflex and allow her to relax and calm down I still have occasional serious nausea attacks but I ALWAYS carry at least water and sometimes diet soda to calm my stomach For what its worth I think my extreme anxiety on the subject was caused by a kindergarten classmate who vomited all over me during naptime The fear of vomiting in public is not typical but it can be very debilitating  and it is much more difficult to treat than a fear of heights or claustrophobia It is virtually impossible to do progressive desensitization for vomiting  its kind of difficult to partially vomit then relax Its a possiblity you can be pregnant if you had sex within that time and or your menstrual cycle can be changing In any event i will consult with your OBGYN andor primary care physican Many people have a fear of anesthesia Recently a medical research paper reported that one in four people may put off surgery because of a lack of understanding andor internal apprehension about anesthesia according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists Anesthesiologist John Dombrowski MD said A person is about 40 times more likely to be struck by lightning than he or she is to die from anesthesiarelated complications Those are pretty good odds Ive always told my patients that they were safer in an accredited surgery center or hospitals operating room with an anesthesiologist in attendance than they were on the freeways or roads getting to the surgery center Whether the patient is having a cosmetic rhinoplasty or a total hip replacement despite the very favorable statistics many people will naturally harbor some worries and may be reluctant to bring them up You should always address them with your surgeon and discuss them with the anesthesiologist In our facial cosmetic surgery practice we tell our patients that the anesthesiologist will call them the night before to take the usual history go over the order of events and answer any questions That is the perfect time to address your questions If youre concerned about pain tell the anesthesiologist Tell him or her what your past history is with surgery if you have had procedures what medications worked and what medications didnt Certainly be 100 percent forthright with respect to discussing what medications you are taking  prescription and nonprescription  since some of these may affect not only anesthesia but blood clotting That includes overthecounter medications herbal supplements vitamins and homeopathic drugs Anything that is put into your body can cause potential problems particularly if they interact with existing prescription medications you are taking or the medications that will be used in surgery If you have a history of nausea and vomiting be sure to share that with your surgeon and with the anesthesiologist There is no reason to fear that because today we have better anesthesia techniques and great medications including tablets and injections which have made postoperative nausea and vomiting very rare Every surgeon wants his patients to have a satisfactory and safe experience He or she just needs to know what your concerns are If you think you are going to have trouble sleeping for several days before the procedure because of anxiety ask your surgeon and he will prescribe a tranquilizer or sedative for you Likewise the practice of anesthesia is all about patient safety and patient comfort Dont be reluctant to bring up any aspect or fear with your anesthesiologist You will sleep better the night before surgery Your first problem is your bad decision to have unprotected sex with friends plural who have most likely had unprotected sex with other people as well The list of sexuallytransmitted diseases that you may have been exposed to is extensive Itching can be as simple as a yeast infection or as lifelongcomplicated as having early stages of herpes You can have a bacterial vaginosis chlamydia syphillis HPVthe list is longer Itching can also be caused by pediculosis crabs scabies You cannot adequately diagnose a person by a photo no more than you can determine if your sexual partners are diseasefree simply because they looked clean You need to get your sore bottom off to a medical provider so that you can be properly examined carefully tested and treated Life is a series of lessons and I certainly hope that you have learned from this experience to NEVER do this again I am sorry but this is a request that WebMD Answers cannot provide We do not recommend specific doctors or clinics There are really no vasovagal syncope doctors per se Any licensed medical provider should be able to help you or go to a clinic that provides medications and immunizations for travelers Without the ability to see this beadsized lump near your anus firsthand Please dont post a picture I cannot blindly determine what you have but some possibilities include anal skin tags hemorrhoids skin abscess condylomata warts etcmany things There is no way to avoid the inevitableyou must see a medical provider so you can have this properly examined diagnosed and treated Stop freaking out The chance of you getting an amoebic infection from shower water in your nose would be highly highly unlikelyunless you are showering with contaminated untreated water Remember this is the same water you drink and use to brush your teeth An allergy to your own urine is not possible Your labial itching may eventually help you overcome your fear of being examined since this may be the ONLY way you can have this problem properly diagnosed This is NOT something that can be done blindly over the Internet based solely on a vague description Having a sympathetic female physician PA or nurse practitioner should ease your discomfort and fear especially if you disclose it prior to your visit Have a trusted friend go with you Your doctor can even provide you with a shortacting antianxiety medication to help you overcome your fear In most cases a yeast infection is the underlying cause but since the labia is covered in skin and skin can have HUNDREDS of dermatological conditions that cause itching it would likely be futile to try and treat a condition that is not even diagnosed If the bleeding is coming from those hemorrhoids they may need to be surgically removed The colonoscopy is going to determine if you have internal hemorrhoids polyps or other reasons to account for your bleeding Prednisone will NOT help hemorrhoids in any way Even NSAIDs like aspirin can cause more bleeding so this may not be the best pain medication for you Moody and loss of appetite does not necessarily mean it was caused by the Depo Provera injection There are hundreds of things that can cause these vague symptoms It may have just been a coincidence that the symptoms began after you last injection If the symptoms persist see your medical provider for a proper examinationdont just assume it was the Depo There is nothing typical or predictable about herpes or the antiviral drugs that are used to suppress outbreaks Every person and their response to herpes and suppressant medictions is different You have stopped taking your acyclovir so you may know those answers as they pretain to you No photographic repliessorry but you can have a trusted adult friend or relative show you how firsthand the best way Sadly I dont know if you are a male or female since some women geneticallysport a mustache too Use a new safety razor and go with the grain Be careful and things will be fine Oryou can get an electric razor It may not be in your hand This could be a tattoo created by the graphite that appears like a piece of the pencil If you did have a foreign body like a piece of the pencil it should have become infected a long time ago If you did have a retained foreign body the biggest risk would be infection but clearly this has not happened There would be no health consequences if this black area was just a residual tattoo The things that he fears appears to have loud noises Start by having his hearing tested by a professional audiologist in a soundcontrolled booth He may have ultrasensitive hearing and those noises are painful to him Before assuming his problem is psychological it would be wise to rule out any organic reasons for his fears Having your husband or a trusted female friend would be great Talk to you women friends too Having someone with you will make you feel safer t may not be the exambut the examiner so consider getting a female nurse practitioner or PA or find a very kind and compassionate gynecologist To many unfortunately this intimate exam is so routinealmost like a dentist looking in your mouththat they may not take the time and care to do it gently Again ask your friends for a referral to someone they find to be helpful Your primary care medical provider can give you a shortacting antianxiety medication if you ask Something like Xanax at a lowdose may be helpful Look deep inside yourself to see if there was a stressful event in the past that may be surfacing when you are having a gynecological exam If so a counselor may be able to help you deal with this very specific anxiety Obviously I do not know all of the details of your oral contact nor the overall health of the person you were kissing but it would not be very likely to contract HIV in this manner Since you are so worried you can consider being tested for you peace of mind You are engaging in some very very risky behavior by having any sexual contact with a prostitute Since you do not know the HIV or other STD status of this woman it would be wise to curtail this activity in the future While it would be unlikely to contact HIV in this manner you may need to be tested for your own peace of mind If a condom breaks during oral sex you would be susceptable to any ORAL disease this person may have some of which may be sexually transmitted Notestosterone will not enlarge your penis or scrotum Due to side effects it would not be advisable to take it unless you are proven to be low in this male hormone and it was specifically prescribed by your medical provider By the way A good sex life has very little to do with penis size It is how you use it Your boyfriend may already have HPV so dont be afraid to tell him Honesty is the best and safest policy when involved in a sexual union If he has had previous partners like you have he could have already been infectedif not from you from someone else If you have HPV in your mouth or throat you could transmit it orally vaginally or even anallyit depends on where you have it I know you have heard this before but the use of condoms will certainly limit the spread of HPV to your sexual partneror any future partner There is really nothing nonsurgical that can permanent fix asymmetrical breast sizes Sure you can use padding on the smaller side to fill the gap in the bra but that does not alter your selfimage when that bra is removed Just about every female patient that I have had over the years who underwent a breast surgery for enlargement making them firmer after a few kids or even having a breast reduction are happy Prices vary on this cosmetic procedure but so do prices on used cars You can spend 5000 a guess since the price varies on a boobjob or 5000 a used car The breast job does not require gasoline insurance or much maintenance and will last a lifetime The car It will eventually fall apart You can get a car loan to buy ityou can get a boob loan to pay for surgery if this is important to you You will likely be glad that you did and your husbandI dont think he will be complaining very much I know that money can be tight but making a modest monthly payment to pay off your new breasts is really something I think most families can financially manage with a bit of planning You had two childrenyour deserve it Many cosmetic surgeons have free consultations Make a few appointments and take your husband with you You should not be any more fertile than you were before starting contraception but you will need to immediately select another effective form of birth control or you may suddently find out how fertile you really are No drinking lemon juice will NOT prevent a stomach virus The citric acid on lemons can damage teeth if you eat them excessively but in moderationyou are not likely to have a problem Lemons are high in vitamin C but many scientific studies have not proven that vitamin C prevents colds or viral infections If this is a testiclar torsion you need to go to the ERnow A torsion is a medical emergency Unfortunately I have no way to reach out and examine you and order a doppler ultrasound to make the diagnosis It would be highly unlikely to cause a pregnancy in the way you described There can be many other reasons for cramps or a change in the menstrual cycle other than pregnancy Ask your medical provider for a shortacting antianxiety medication to help you relax on your flight There are also shortacting sleeping medications if you truly want to go to sleep during this long flight Not knowing your medical history age etc it would not be appropriate for me to suggest a certain drug or dosage That decision would be up to you and your consulting medical provider Do I have the ability to diagnose you over the Internet No I do not I do not have any way of determining the cause or the significance of your symptoms based solely on your brief posting I do not know your medical history nor do I have the ability to reach out and examine you  all essential components to getting an accurate diagnosis While I am very sympathetic to your financial situation and lack of insurance there is very little that can be achieved without a handon medical examination Look for free clinics student health centers or urgent care facilities Give you body and your health the same consideration as you would if your car suddenly broke down and needed a costly repair Bronchitis is not contagious so your baby is safe Please keep breastfeedingyou cannot transmit a respiratory infection through breast milk Babies do get colds and viral infections but a threemonth old breast fed baby is still wellprotected by maternal immunity Breathholding spells are just a type of tantrum While shocking to witness they are innocent and are likely to happen again until she gets out of her tantrum stage about another year Clearly we cant give kids everything they want 100 of the time to avoid confrontation so you may see another one real soon In this case your granddaughter brought it on herself so make sure to point this out to her as a teachable moment You will find lots of information on the Internet regarding these breathholding spells Hang in there Grandma I cant really answer that question as to why you do this since each persons response to danger or scary situations would be different Some people screamsome faintyou take the chance of soiling your pants What concerns me is this reaction when you hear a loud phone or misplace your keysthis is NOT normal so I strongly suggest that you see your medical provider first to make sure there is nothing physically wrong and then see a good counselor to help you better control this reaction In the meantime it would be wise to avoid these stressful situations I dont know the dosage or medical reason you were prescribed corticosteroids but I can say they are safeand very effective in treating inflammation Most people do not get high when they take them but it they can interfere with sleep if taken near bedtime If you are reluctant to comply with your doctors recommendations it would be wise to discuss it with himher You will mess your periods upand waste your money Emergency contraception is called the morning after pill because this is when you should take it If you are taking before you even have sex you need to reevaluate your contraceptive needs Either get on birth control permanent just in case or insist 100 that your partner use a condom or just say NO Get your own blood pressure machine either a manual one or a hightech electronic one Take your OWN blood pressure and keep a careful log Randomly high blood pressures due to anxiety we call it white coat hypertension tends to be discounted if all of your home blood pressures are normal Some clinicians are just more gentle than others For women I would suggest a female provider MD PA or nurse practitioner Not that men cannot be gentle I am a man but a woman provider should be much more sympathetic to your concerns Make the appointment and then call them personally a day or so before your exam to discuss your concerns Knowing that you have had a bad experience in the past should make them more understanding take their time and make this important exam lessstressful for you A small amount of bleeding can be expected with a pap sometimes but certainly the clinician can be a bit more gentle with the bimanual examination when feeling your uterus cervix and ovarian areas Without the ability to see his little foot firsthand I really couldnt comment if this will delay his walking but my blind guess would be NO Babies have a remarkable ability to circumvent these minor anomalies He will most likely be running through your house in about five months or so Make sure to specifically ask his pediatrician about this or ask to be referred to a pediatric orthopedist for a consultation Its only a dream It would not be very likely that you would conceive in this way but to be safe just do a few home pregnancy tests and consider this a lessonlearned This practice is very dangerous sexplay that will eventually lead to intercourse so be prepared Dont be in denial that it will not eventually happen Clearly you are in an intimate relationship so go to Student Health and get on an effective contraceptive pill Depo etc and make that boyfriend of yours use a condomeven if you both have clothes on It is always safer to contain those babycausing sperm on one place If he cant keep them in his testicles then he should at least keep them in a condom Yes the virus that causes the common wart can spread fromt he fingers to the lips or even the inside of the nose guess how this may have happened The tape is a good idea but why not just treat the wart A few seconds of freezing it with liquid nitrogen may do it or it could take a few treatments depending on the location the size of the wart and your daughters cooperation  this can sting There are other slower but lesspainful methods as well If you treat the wart on the finger then the chance of it spreading is very unlikely He is your fiance Be honest and just tell him the truth I remember a similar situation with one of my patients When she finally got the nerve to tell him he was relieved He had contracted herpes himself years before and was afraid to tell  Not all people who get exposed to herpes will get it You are on suppression medications for herpes I assume so the chance of an subsequent outbreak is lesslikely but still possible Obviously if you know you are having signs of an outbreak you should avoid sex at that time Some studies have shown that it is possible to transmit this virus to another person even if you to not have active lesions but this is lesslikely as well This is the risk that both of you will need to take If both of you had sexual partners in the past you may have been equally as exposed to the potential of getting an sexuallytransmitted disease You may have been the unlucky one but honesty will go a long long way in your new relationship if you just tell him Nicotine is a powerful stimulant and you can definitely get reactions While your anxiety may be more complicated than just nicotine it would obviously be best for you not to smoke anymore There are medications that can help but you will need to see your medical provider to have them prescribed The effects of the nicotine exposure should be waning each day so it is unlikely that you will have any permanent effects Again since anxiety can be much more complex as to the causes seeing your health care provider would be advised I really do not have enough information to answer that question specifically for you If you are a virgin and have never had sex then yes it would be normal to be scared for many reasons You may have a fear of an unintended pregnancy an STD or just afraid of the sexual act itself since you have never experienced it before If you are new to a relationship and are being pressured to have sex remember that YOU ARE IN CHARGE You do not have to have sex until you are ready I dont know if you are a male or female but if you have ever been sexuallymolested in the past the idea of having sexual intimacy could be frightening If you have been sexually involved in the past without problems and are now having issues it may take a few visits to a counselor to uncover any hidden reasons for your fears I dont know what thing you are talking about Was it an instrument to clean out earwax and other debris or was it just the funnellike tip of the otoscope the instrument with the light If your ears hurt during the examand still hurts the clinician most likely scratched or abraided the very sensitive lining of the ear canal You may need some antibiotic drops so CALL this person tell him the story and have him call in a prescription for you No sense in you paying for another visit unless he plans on doing it for free I suffered from extreme anemia as well You may want to talk to her doctor about the iron infusions Those really are of more help than the actual iron supplement We had sex 3 days after my period in july it started the 14th ended the 17thand we had sex on the 20th He

awful I used to dig my face apart trying to get them out along with the comedones blackheads and pimplescysts Plus Ive had another type of cyst that causes calcifications like having little pieces of gravel under the skin generally thats something that happens less in young people and more in people over 50 These hard cysts when removed can sometimes be dark in color The skin makes melanin the pigment that causes suntans in lightskinned people and that creates skin tone in darkerskinned people When the glands that produce melanin become blocked by certain cysts what youre describing can result My father had a cheek cyst for years that was lanced by a dermatologist and almost exploded Skin can do some disturbing things Its the largest organ of the body However there is one concern here the possibility of skin cancer My father had it repeatedly my uncle had it Im at risk for it and everybody should look out for it and practice sun safety People with chronic skin problems that involve the immune system and actual skin damage which severe lifelong acne does may be at higher risk for it Consult a dermatologist but be prepared the wait for an appointment is long and some insurances may resist paying for it A referral from your primary care provider may be necessary Could be blood poisoning Speak to the dentist about various anxietyreducing methods such as hypnosis therapy medication or nitrous oxide Sometimes just becoming more familiar with the procedures will help a lot There are many dentists who have special skills in dealing with phobic patients But in many cases it is just a matter of finding someone you can trust What I can tell you is that there is nothing to be gained and plenty to be lost by waiting Whatever dental problems you have will get worse So call your local dental society to find someone that can help you with your anxiety and your dental problems The best thing you can do is continue breastfeeding while you are sick The

recommend speaking to him as soon as possible I talked to my now husband very early on as soon as I saw that things were getting serious but before they got sexual I gave him the facts told him he was free to leave if he wasnt comfortable  no harm no foul He wasnt interested in going anywhere but was appreciative that I spoke up about it I take medication every day and double up during outbreaks but you are right the threat of spreading it to him is certainly there He has read up on the issue and is more informed now and supportive I recommend having some websites available or printouts with you  ready to give him when discussing the condition Sometimes our fear of disclosure is overblown It also gives us a chance to be upfront and honest with our partner about things that happened to us prior to meeting them that were not our choice not our wish but we are dealing with and hoping in sharing with our new love to have their support so we can deal with the issue together Good luck i

your bowels is there urgency or cramping I didnt an obvious way to reply to an Answer so this is in lieu of one I dont know much about this topic but i would definitely tell you it couldve been a seizure I would go to the emergency room if i were you You want to handle this before it becomes permanent hey I am experiencing the same thing at the momente and my ex partner had intercourse and he got the condom stuck up me and I had my fingers up me trying to pull it out and I could feel that it was there but feel as if I did not remove it at the time it happened and now that I look in this time its not there when I am thinking to myself and am pretty sure I didnt remove it at the time it happened and now I dont know how to remove it because it was in the time it happenedum if I think of anything I will let you know You know at 22 weeks old your baby can move breath have the hiccups and it also starts hearing your voice you dont want to have the baby give it up for Adoption dont kill it just because you decided after 22 weeks your not ready I read your question and while I dont know what to tell you to do exactly I can tell you that a medical professional will not be shocked by anything you have done They have to keep things confidential so dont worry about that part of it either Plus its their job  they are there for things like this Before you start self medicating I would see a doctor and not wait I know there are a lot of topical medications that shouldnt be put in sensitive areas so I would really be hesitant to treat without a doctors care Also the faster you go the faster you will feel better and your anxiety over it will be lifted supplement with rose hips oilpills ginger tea dong quai rootblack cohosh herb red raspberry leaf maitake mushroomsdandelion roots goldenseal maybe make an appointment with a free clinic just for an exam also my kids were all like this some kids are just more sensitive to sound than others but its always wise to get their ears checked by a physician I would go get tested I am not sure if hepatitis is a permanent condition or not sorry Best of luck my dr had me on high protein eat eggs peanut butter greek yogart  instant breakfast read labels try to get 30 grams protein daily Most certainly not So you dont want to go through with this pregnancy because your high risk and it will put you and your babys lives at risk But yet you will abort the baby at 22 weeks You have already had 6 abortions that right there has been harmful to your body and probably has something to do with being high risk I think its too late for an abortion If you were going to do that then you should have done it MONTHS ago Put that poor baby up for adoption Based on your history get your tubes tied I am 22 weeks pregnant also that baby has a heart beat and is moving and can hear your voice Do not get pressured into something you are not ready for If you arent comfortable talking about it with him you arent ready to have intercourse with him He is buying condoms but  doesnt want to pressure you Take a big step back and reevaluate this relationship Yes mama I am cosmetologist and it can that why your skin stays mosit when you put on lotion it doesnt stay on there it absorbs past and that why the lotion disappear the epidermis the first layer to skin that you are seeing so therefore if you do not see the lotion it absorb i wish i could help but i dont even know what she put in her arm as Im not familiar with most drugs I suggest you plan an intervention or call 911 if life threading Let her know that what she is afraid of is not the worst thing in the world everyone gets sick and if you can get her to understand getting sick in front of everyone will not kill her and she wouldnt be the first she probably will not get sick have her imagine what she is most afraid of and the most likely resposnse of those around her Chances are she has visions much worse than reality and can understand that No I dont think you would be feeling the baby yet and I would imagine if you had a pregnancy in a tube you would be in painIt could be just gas but I would have it checked outAre you having prenatal care Have you been receiving prenatal careAt 22 weeks this could be high risk for you and the baby anywayIm not sure if its even legal to have an an abortion at 22 weeks and now days the baby might be able to survive at this ageYou should seek a doctor that cares for high risk pregnancies and trust them to see you and the baby through itWhen the baby is born you will be glad you made a choice to keep itYou will surely love this little person something scared u in our family when something scares u that is what hapens we let a father from church pray over us and it releaves us a little to where we can talk about it and help one another take that fear and smoothe the process out and lets us rest Should we be concern or see what tomorrow brings why do that there are other ways like ADOPTION why kill a baby that is WRONG Get help First I validate the fear ie I know you are terrified Being dismissive might intensify their fears Then I listen to the fears Usually the person is aware the fear is some freefloating irrational or undefinable feeling Then I begin reassuring the person that it will end just hang in there I usually hold their hand or stroke their back Like some have said breathing into a paper bag works well for most people A tranquilizer works quickly Any facts you can give them also is calming I list the symptoms and potential solutions so they know what to and what not to expect I say things like Its okay it sounds like youre having an anxiety attack It will pass It will not kill you It is not a heart attack They come on suddenly and they can leave just as suddenly You will find your way home that seems to the one of the symbolic underlying fears Im here with you This wont last forever It will end You are safe One thing that seems to help more than anything is to have the person do a physical activity right there in the moment Yoga as one person suggested would be wonderful if the situation allows it Breathing in the bag is another good one But any task that forces concentration back to the moment puts them in touch with reality Its nearly impossible to give energy to the fear when one is doing a physical task And lastly I have discovered that caffeine often triggers an attack Too much coffee tea soda etc often is the culprit So you might want to ask them if they ingested a good deal of caffeine an hour or more before the attack If so they may have a caffeine allergy I hope this helps Get some professional help They dx and prescribe meds if needed See a psychiatrist and a good counselor Good Luck your family doctor or gynecologist can prescribe birth control and give you the side effects of your choices there are also womens clinics that can provide birth control all of these usually require a papsmear Stress levels cause menstruation to fluctuate so your best bet is to simply relax The condom as you stated didnt have any holes and didnt break so as long as the guy put the condom on correctly you should be fine My ex and I had sex in high school when we were 14 6 years ago with no birth control and no condom for the first 3 times Let me say that it was incredibly dumb to do but we were both nervous awaiting her period and to scare the hit out of us even more she had a skipped period but was never pregnant Just relax your most likely panicking for no reason Hope this helps how big are the clots pea sized or bigger whatever the case it would probably be wise and safer to check it out at a free clinic Hi depending on the time of when he does this activity sperm can live up to days best you can do is run the shower before you get in and hopefully itll wash away this is very common with this kind of Diabetes Have you ever had your blood sugar checked You may be hypoglycemic Your not fat something ive learned about having panic attacks is they cant and will not kill or hurt you But that aside what I do to stop my panic attacks is this and doing this can stop them just as quick as it comes When you feel your panic attack coming tell your self out loud or scream it in your mind that I am fine I am ok stop stop stop stop go away And repeat it over and over till it goes away By telling your brain to stop it breaks the panic signal and replaces it with the stop signal Try it it works for me please try it and next time it happens just stay calm try to breath normal and tell your mind what I said Hope it works for you also you can do this wwwanxietypanicsupportcom Its a free chat room I promise my screen name is joker and there is a lot of ppl on there that can help you with anxiety You can come in as a guest or make a name Yes Go right away You should be able to get some assistance even with no insurance And if theres a Walgreens in your area they offer a prescription discount card that may help with your lack of funds for a mood stabilizer If not try Sams Club or Costco Even if youre not a member by law they have to grant you access to their pharmacy Before I got insurance thats how I was able to afford my meds Also check into Lithium Thats a low cost highly effective mood stabilizer Ive been on it for three years and its the best drug Ive ever been on for my bipolar i just had my period on nov 6 and been having sexmy cycle last 3 daysbut for some reason im still bleeding after 12 days later what does this means before you decide to gain weight what is your height looking at your user name im assuming your a male who weighs 140lb on average male height in north america is 6 feet and your bmi is average unless you are 6 feet 9 you are underweight or 5 feet 9 you are overweight You may get an infection or you may not get one If there is an injury inside the vagina and the fecal matter got through that injury it is highly possible that you may have an infection The names of the possible infections that may occur are Bacterial Vaginosis and a Vaginal yeast infectionIt is better to consult a gynecologist to run a vaginal wet prep test to ensure everything is alright A board certified dermatologist like Dr Eric Schweiger can help you with that It will be better if you seek help from professionals who can help you with that particular concern of yours I am not a cocaine user even once so I do not concern about its effect none I will ask for help when I have this problem Thank you for assumption We are alot alike in many ways  I was worried about taking birth control also Im taking Junel which is the generic to loestrin I love it My cramps barely bother me and its usually the first day that bothers me It hasnt altered my periods The sex thing my now husband waited for me 9mo and he never pressured me He actually had me wait longer so that i was positive that i was ready I too was a virgin i was about to turn 20 I say wait until you are absolutely positive thats who you will be with o and my fella got tested before we did it bc i asked him to I wasnt his firstbut he was mine so never can be too certain I took bc for 2 months before and we used condoms also until now since we r married Hope this helps I would ween myself off of the medicine and cut the pill in half and take half for a week The next week I would take half of a half then take half of a half every other day for a week The fourth week I would discontinue altogether I would tell my doctor if or when I had a visit I think wthis drug you could probably just stop taking it all together but of course I am not a doctor Its not like a blood pressure medicine though I had horrible side effects TTP bruising platelets dramatically dropped muscles hurt brain fog tired from this drug I will never take a statin again I believe there are other more natural things out there that will work My cholestrol was 225 when I was put on it Good luck That medicine is okay for anxiety some people do have side effects but that goes along with all medicines If you are not sure about taking it tell your doctor and they can try something else but you may still have side effects There are some otc sleeping aids you could try with less side effects but I dont know how bad your anxiety is You would just have to try and see And if you just do that many a month you may be okay But you need to talk to your doctor Hope you find the right thing and get better First of all taking emergency contraception before engaging in any sexual intercourse is not going to work for future sexual encounters Emergency contraception is to be used after having sex usually unprotected The side effects from emergency contraception can be irregular excessive vaginal bleeding pelvicabdominal cramping headache etc It is pointless to take before having sexual intercourse Id advice to repeatedly wash off your eyes with cold tap water Then switch off lights and be in dark for a minute Then turn on light to see if you have sensitivity to light If you experience sensitivity to light then it is advisable to visit a doctor Hope it helps you could have an kidney stone that wont pass without having minor surgerytalk to your doctor about doing this and also you need to have an renal altursound done to make sure that theres not any more kidney stones I would suggest showing her more way that your relationship is stronger and different meaning better show her more tlc affection If you were not feeling panicked or overwhelmed at the time of the episode it may not be a panic attack and you may want to talk with your doctor a panic attack doesnt always have to be paralyzing there are different levels of panic attacks whatever is causing your spells I hope that you get better well some people get nose bleeds alot do you get them once in a while  i dont think the dayqull would have anything to do with it  your nose could have been bleeding due to dryness in your nose or sinus  as for it happeing again could have been to the fact when we cry to put a lot of blood pressure up into our heads and it could have triggard it  i think its nothing to worry about everyone is different i broke my nose when i was young it didnt bleed  n ive never had a nose bleed in my life but thats just me  i have a friend who gets one everytime he get mad or starts crying blood just starts running out but if it doesnt stop or gets worse within a week go to the doctor  hope u feel better well i would say try to est soft foods my dad who eats like a pig i might add  began having the same problem didnt lasts as long it began and before he knew it he was unble to go at all he waited 8 days before going to the hospital  which i dont advise to find he had a tumor blocking his intestines from letting the stool pass they did a very minor surgery and gave him a better diet and hes been fine my guess is its possible you could have something like this but its not blocking completely only partly which could be the reason you cant go all the time  a stool softener is a good idea rather than a laxative because it this is the problem you could stress the tumor and cause it to swell which would make the problem worse and its only an idea many people will disagree with this but sometimes a cigarette can help as they make people poop  but thats a once in a blue kinda thing and only if you have no other choice at that moment either way this is something you should go to the doctor for they may want to go in with a camera  i myself had tumers as a child which cause pain blood and blockage  they were removed 3 times with lasers do you have blood when you go and not to be gross but is your stool normal of more watery when it does happen  bacause it you do for sure have a blockage it more likely you will have more watery stool  i hope you feel better and hope this helped you to some level  i would go to the doctor  infections in your mouth can be very bad i dont know for sure if the urge to pee is connected  but infections left untreated in your mouth can lead to big problems  and in worse cases death due to the infection making it way into your brain and spine either way def make a trip to your docs office asap Sounds like your stools are just a bit out of wack A laxative can cause diarrhea so that part is normal The question is why did you think you needed one To get your stools back on track increase your daily amount of fiber That means more fruit veggies whole grains and beans in your diet If you start eating these at every meal you should see an improvment in a few days to a werek If you just cant stomach those types of foods there are plenty of OTC supplements that are inexpensive and and work well for most people Ask your pharmacist to show you some examples If your problems last longer than a month or you notice black tar like stools see your doctor Could be a couple of thingsbut more info would be needed Sleep paralysis is a condition where a person wakes up unable to move their body because the mind woke up before your body Its temporary but it could cause fear or anxiety Sleep apnea could also be a cause When a persons airway is closed apnea and they cant get breath until they wake up fear or panic can set it thats what happened to me until I got my CPAP machine Also could be a panic attack or anxiety issue Anything traumatic recently happen in the morning Have you or anyone in your family been diagnosis with depression or anxiety If it continues or starts really affecting your day Id see a physican Good Luck Her rubbing hand lotion on you or the condom should not give you HIV Blood and body fluids pass HIV So as long as she didnt have blood on her hands or vaginal fluids on her hands you should be fine But remember that other STDs can be passed to people even when condoms are used Its less likely but it can happen Your testicules are arent covered by a condom so be careful who you have sex with I already have counseling and it works good the only problem is my sex drive thats why i ask this question  Sounds like a yeast infection to me Monistat 3 saved my life I couldnt sleep and was at the point of tears Experiencing those symptoms were the worst and I broke down until I asked an MA that I worked with She recommended this treatment I googled it and was TERRIFIED at the responses that it was worse to use than the actual condition itself But I buckled down and said it really cant be any worse than this I and the MA was right Nothing burned or felt worse Just relief Every day after got better and better I am finishing day 3 of monistat and I feel back to normal I am thankful I didnt pay attention to the bad reviews I feel like people come online more so to bash their bad experience with it because it didnt help them and those that it did help they dont find a need to let others know because they are over the hurdle Thats why Im posting People need to know that its not scary and that its NORMAL And extremely uncomfortable But that this product WORKS The symptoms I had were as follows paper cut feeling on the labia burning on the inside of the vagina and sleeplessness due to extreme discomfort The only thing I did differently than what the box recommended was using calmoseptine cream on the outside for the itching and burning instead of the cream in the box Calmo has a menthol release and was the only thing that helped The monistat ointment that came with the 3 was bogus and made it burn like crazy Calmo is used for a wide variety of skin issues such as this and medical professionals seem to think this okay to use for this condition to get relief I didnt consult with one before using it and it got me though the majority of my day Just remember to cleanse and reapply frequently and use less as it gets better because skin needs to breathe Good luck to you all and seek medical attention if you have a fever or any other out of the ordinary symptoms for yeast infection Other than that get to your nearest Rite Aide or other pharmacy provider and get Monistat for relief Just remember that 1 is the most potent and 7 is the least and if you are prone to more sensitivity go with the longer treatment God speed  Your age is needed to appropriately feelout a possible diagnose However my best guess is that you are experiencing symptoms from two or more problems The neck and left arm pain could be a bulging disc at the C7 vertebraewhich I too have recently experienced Chiropractor adjustments with following massages successfully relieved the numbness and pain in my arm the neck pain still exist but could be related to the arthritiswhich has developed from my injuries Be careful to to seek treatment asap because without treatment the spine normally worsens If you experience extreme pain nausea can develop but diarrhea is not related Diarrhea could possibly come from a case of irritable bowel syndrome IBS or polyps in the colon Change of diet will drastically improve your symptoms Hot flashes normally result from the loss of the hormone estrogen It begins to depreciate in the body during menopause With your heart racing vomiting and fear Im reminded of anxiety or panic attacks Deep breathing meditation will improve anxiety And problems with vision could be related to the spine blood pressure or the need for glasses because of age If you are middle age see a doctor but get use to these type problems for your body is beginning its shut down process Worrying does not help it is only making things worse for you Get the sleep your body needs and make sure your water intake is appropriate Sleep is very important as is water Try to keep your spine in the natural position while sleeping Seek out free clinics state or government help someone that you know may have the answer for you Believe for yourself healing and it will come no till now you are safe continue safe sex Dont worry about it The average penis in america is 6 inches I to am not well endowed but my Wife LOVE mine She says it is just right and doesnt hurt her You are probably going by the magazines and movies Trust me they ARE NOT normal sized We are created individually and when you find Mrs right she wont care I had the one hour and failed but passed the three hour test Try not to worry The important thing to remember is that if you have gestational diabetesnit does not mean that you will always have diabetes hi ya it happens some time i have the same issue some dayi am 27years olddont worryits not big issuetry to control his sugar level You need to talk to your mom or an adult you trust Dont let this wait There are lots of reasons other than cancer for lumps but early detection is the best And yes I am a breast cancer survivor My son had the same thing Dont use the Qtip anymore You are probably pushing the wax further in your ear which is making that noise Make sure you are taking the medicine and try not to use the Qtip It should clear up with the Amoxicillin If not ask for some ear drops that are antibiotic to loosen the wax in your ear HIV cant be transmitted this way That is the average size ptsd probably i am on prazosin and xanax for it "}
