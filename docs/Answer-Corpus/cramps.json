have lower risks of stomach ache Or you could explore Vyvanse which is similar to Adderall but has a different delivery system If you are reluctant to change meds one alternative to discuss with your physician would be to split the Adderall dose  give half the capsule and then 2030 minutes later give the other half If you sprinkle the med into food do not let the second half of the dosage sit in the food for the 30 minutes since the beads will dissolve prematurely I dont know why this has happened but I recommend that you visit your doctor Yes This is very normal You said you havent had your period in 2 years Your releasing all that backed up blood You will experience Just a thought Probably have no energy because you are dehydrated from the increased loss of fluid even tho you are drinking it may very well not be enough The blood may be caused from the increased amount of defecation causing irritation in the bowel The first thing that comes to my mind is Cholecystitis gallbladder inflammation andor stones I have been an RN for over 20 years and have had this condition myself and it was necessary to have my gall bladder removed The symptoms that you describe is exactly what I experienced to a T A total gall bladder work up was suggested on my behalf and surgery was required A visit to your physician is must assuredly suggested and questions related to the gall bladder and even the pancreas should be explored No I was not on the pillI have not been on birth control for 2 years Arthritis comes in different forms But some hallmark signs of most arthritic conditions include pain joint swelling and difficultly in articulating the movement of joints Some of the symptoms listed in your question could be signs of an arthritic conditionThey could also be signs of some other medical disorders Arthritis can affect individuals of any age but its diagnosis increases as we age As most doctors can attest to many of their patients complain of back pain after reaching 40 years of age An xray of those painful 40 something old backs may show as the only notable impression the fact that arthriticdegenerative changes were observed I suggest that you make an appointment with the family doctor who may assess your discomfort and any range of motion limitations That same person may get the diagnostic ball rolling by requesting xray images ordering blood work and other lab studiesThe general practicing physician may also start you on some regime of antinflammatory and pain medication as well as referring you to other medical specialists such as orthopedists or rheumatologists I hope that you have found this answer helpful and that your pain cramping and fist closure issues resolve themselves soon   I did not see the original question and its answer but will address your issue According to H Hospital News  substantial pain is reported by approximately 60 of those individuals diagnosed with ALS The pain level varies from patient to patient and is dependent on factors such as the course of disease progression Burning shooting pain numbness and tingling are reported pain qualities When acknowledged by the patient and investigated by the treating physician pain may be seen as follows with ALS stiffness due to localized injury to the sensory system fat  muscle loss may be responsible for compression of nerves and pinched nerves pain in the legs due to immobility clenched muscles causing painful spasms painful muscle twitching and frozen shoulder causing a throbbing pain and sleep disturbances I hope that my response clearly shows that significant pain is typically a part of ADL Many of the over the counter pain relievers contain at least some common ingredients Since you do not really know which ingredient in these medications is causing the negative sideeffects it may be a good idea to discuss the reactions with the family doctor and to be referred to an allergist specialist Its really not the that she is reacting to but instead at least one of its ingredients Another valuable source of information is the neighborhood pharmacist This individual if the sideeffect is frequently seen in  may be familiar with the ingredient responsible for the negative reactions My husband and I have had trouble with leg cramps especially at night and we have found that taking a teaspoon of regular yellow mustard stops the cramping immediately and it does not return My husband has actually started taking the mustard before going to bed to avoid being awakened by the cramping He says this helps him It could be something else you need to go to doctor and see why are you having all these problem maybe your ovarian cysts came back I cant really say I just advise you to see your doctor I hope this help you Good Luck Luv

they started again regularly for 4 months and then stopped again that was 5 years agostill period free Because of this we are at greater risk for uterine cancer and need to be vigilant about keeping up with our yearly check up Sometimes the more active we are during our periods the easier they become See a gyn for check up and follow up I would say no You can have implantation bleeding however implantation bleeding would never be enough to fill a super tamping Did you find resolution I have the same problem and for me it is unrelated to a heart condition kidneys or stress related that has an entirely different feeling I have had this happen since I was a child but it only last a few minutes This time around it has lasted over 12 hours and I am still seeking an answer For your any dental problem plz click here  confidentdentalcare  it is almost five months now since i order a pregnancy spell cast on me on Facebook Oduduwa Ajakaye i saw in a website on how he help a couple to get pregnant and i contacted him which i started seeing changes on my body since the first week of last 4 months and i am 18 weeks gone and i am carrying my own baby in my womb i am so happy that i finally got pregnant after all i have been through contact him for any problems you are having he will surely provide you a solution All thanks be to him I called and talked to my Dr She said this period is on track with when I should have started but since we have been trying and this period is different to take a pregnancy test and on Monday call the office and let her know if it was positive but if not then call anyway and set up my normal monthly appointments for treatments So i guess it is just a waiting game I have been taking care of children my whole life and have two of my own My experience with this type of pain could be one of a few things i will list them and then explain below too much fresh fruit and veggies not enough water in her diet Celiac disease dairy sensitivity crohns disease Your doctor can test her for celiac or you really you can do it on your own if you are to the point that you are fed up with doctors Celiacs are on a Gluten Free diet nothing with gluten whatsoever and that includes alot of things that you wouldnt think have the so called no no ingredients in them so I would research gluten free diets just to be sure Im not really sure what crohns disease consists of however ive had friends that have it and experience the same thing your daughter is going through here is a website you can look at for that that they referred me too httpwwwcrohnsandcolitisinfocomcidppcppdgglcrohnsdaccinfonontvcrohn27sdiseasePhrase My nephew had dairy sensitivity and it cause these issues as well If she is an avid milk drinker I would consider lowering the fat content of the milk for a while for instance if you have her on whole milk go to 2 that kind of thing And limit her other dairy intake for a while butter yogurt cheese etcif it helps some just by reducing these things then you know its a dairy issue and i would switch her to soy milk rice milk or something of the sort and stop the cheese alltogether believe it or not not enough water in her diet can cause these issues as well they could be anything from sever pain to constipation or a mixture of the two I have had this issue myself the correct amount of water to have is 8 8oz glasses in a 24 hour period if you cant get her to drink it dry using the new koolaid liquid drink mixers or crystal light something of the sort just be sure whatever you mix with the water does not contain aspartame as this is poisonous for the human body if given too much over a long period of time last but not least too many fresh fruits and veggies can cause severe gas build up which can lead to pain and constipation as well try sticking to the food guide pyramid with this though you can look it up online to suit her age and weight and everything as to how much she should have These are all from personal experience or from close friends and family that have had these issues I hope this helps Nope never figured it out although it seems to be getting better as well as the cramps 7 months later It may be possible I took a home test this morning and it was negative But I think It was due to user error I dont think I provided enoughumwell you know to get a correct reading Are those normal signs of early pregnancy Im very sorry to hear that happened to you I hope you are all right My boyfriend and I have been trying to concive for about 5 or 6 months now Ive had my period every month since then and I feel like Ive taken a million home tests I havent got a positive since we started trying Ive just assumed that is taking a while I know its normal for it to take a while and not to be worried if its been under a year Would it still be possible to be a miscarage if I dont think I was prego in the first place Did you have a dull almost cramp like pain in your lower right abdomen and whole lower back Its been like that all day and Ive been nauseaus all day I have not gotten sick but it feels like I could at any moment This could be casued by a lack of potassium Bananas are a good source Ow Sorry youre going through this The only way to tell for sure whats going on with your ribcage is to get a physical examination from a health care provider Start with your primary care provider He or she can evaluate this problem and refer you for tests xray for example or a specialist if needed Its not uncommon for the cartilage between ribs to become inflamed or even torn from some sort of trauma which could be as slight as overexercising However the pain youre describing could be caused by something else entirely It could even be related to structures below your ribcage Thats why your best bet is to get a physical exam as soon as you can Good luck to you This is an interesting question and Im glad you asked it In order to develop an allergy to a substance you have to be exposed to it In other words its extremely rare to experience an allergic reaction to something on first exposure Its not impossible but its fairly rare One good example is penicillin Millions of people took penicillin as children and suffered no ill effects Many of those people today have penicillin allergies That early exposure caused their bodies to mount an extreme immune reaction to penicillin later on That could be what happened to you too If a physician confirmed your allergy you need to take it to heart Allergies not only can come on later in life they can get worse over time So that diarrhea from eating eggs today could turn into anaphylaxis eventually You also should be aware that people with a documented egg allergy may be discouraged from getting flu shots Id suggest you talk with your health care provider to see if this restriction applies to you Sorry youre going through this Its difficult to give up a wellloved food Even in women with regular periods what youre describing can be normal Sometimes our bodies hiccup a little bit Maybe thats what youre experiencing Other things to consider Have you recently had unprotected sex could you be pregnant Its possible to have a very light period right after becoming pregnant So if pregnancy is a possibility Id suggest you take a home pregnancy test At the other end of the spectrum is it possible youre premenopausal This could be another explanation for your unusual period this month If neither of these scenarios apply to you youre probably safe to wait and see what happens next month If everything proceeds as normal then youre good to go Hope this helps Im sorry to hear youre going through this Few things are as painful as leg cramps Two common causes of lower leg cramps are dehydration and low potassium levels in the blood So your first potential solution is to simply drink more water If you have high blood pressure you should consult your physician before you substantially increase your water intake but in general drinking a few extra glasses of water a day isnt going to hurt you If you have high blood pressure and take a water pill diuretic you should find out if it is a potassiumsparing type of not If your diuretic is not potassiumsparing you should be taking a prescription potassium pill Again if youre uncertain about these things you should consult your doctor I dont recommend people run out and start taking potassium supplements which you can buy over the counter to cure leg cramps Potassium is a key mineral for heart function and overdosing on potassium can cause serious heart rhythm abnormalities However eating potassiumrich foods like sweet potatoes tomato sauce and whole beans like navy beans or pinto beans not only will increase your serum blood potassium levels to possibly help the leg cramps but they will be dietfriendly for your diabetes Everything Ive told you here is based on the assumption you dont have a lot of other health issues besides the diabetes going on and that you dont take a lot of medications Many medications and coexisting medical conditions can cause lower leg cramps So its always a good idea to let your medical professional know whats going on Wishing you well Im not a diabetic I have had my legs cramp up on me once in a great while It doesnt happen very often Really I rarely have any leg cramps But when I do get them they hurt Headaches can be a common side effect from the trauma of the concussion and NSAIDs nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs are commonly used to help treat the pain  Leg cramps are mostly caused by dehydration low magnesium or low blood calcium The best treatment for cramps is to rehydrate and replenish your electrolytes possibly with chicken or beef broth Low potassium is usually a sign of muscle weakness Leg cramps are mostly caused by dehydration low magnesium or low blood calcium The best treatment for cramps is to rehydrate and replenish your electrolytes possibly with chicken or beef broth Dont use quinine for your husbands leg cramps Quinine is a malaria drug that can cause serious side effects such as severe bleeding abnormal heart rhythms and even death The FDA issued a drug safety warning on July 8 2010 and will soon require the drugmaker to warn doctors of its potentially lifethreatening side effects Talk to the doctor about other safe ways to ease leg cramps Dont be worried be happy It means you really are losing weight and getting your body in shape It will probably return to a semi normal period after a significant amount of time has passed with your new regiment Significant weight loss big changes in physical activity all impact your period and make it lighter shorter and overall more bearable It probably has something to do with the hormonesendorphies released when exercising I dont really know the chemical part of it but this a normal occurrence Its also why women who are really active often times have to slow down in order to get pregnant so their body returns to normal functioning and they start ovulating regularly again But please do NOT take running as birth control Definitely not the message here Hello hun I have been pregnant twice and have suffered two miscarriages So I feel as though I could help you with this question Its normal to feel cramping as your muscles expand and stretch I had the very same question for my doctor and Ill tell you what she suggested She told me to increase my water intake and if its to uncomfortable to take a Tylenol Now what I will warn is if you are in pain not uncomfortable but in serious pain to seek out a doctor I had terrible pains in my lower abs with my second pregnancy felt like I was dying couldnt sleep I ended up having a UTI I think most women know what kinda pain they can manage and what doesnt feel right Sounds like maybe you are if you havent starting your period and if you already have it sometimes in approx 2 weeks after your period stops you get a cramp like feeling from your ovaries doing there job Yes some women have significant cramping while taking Provera to start a menstrual period While we tell women their flow will begin around 72 hours after the last Provera pill is taken bleeding can also begin before the pills are completed Usually it is suggested that all the pills be taken because the lining of the uterus may need all the synthetic progesterone to fully convert to a healthy status secretory effect In your specific case if you are having very severe cramping it is a reasonable option to check with the GYN prescribing the Provera They may suggest something for the discomfort If your bleeding does start before the medication is done confirm that you should finish up all the Provera pills  Go immediately to your physician and make sure you dont have a tubal pregnancy this is a very serious condition The fetus is growing outside the fallopian wall rather than growing inside the abdomen This is an extremely painful condition and will only get worse without proper treatment and is very dangergous for you I know I got it tired once and cut but like you said it could have untied I took a test 3 days into me being late which came back negative but i have like I did with my first 3 so I have no clue Ive done my research on the tubal ligation and damn people still get pregnant after getting them tied So i dont know It wouldnt hurt to take the test now and see if you are pregnant I am 18 and have had period problems myself so I know how frustrating it is I recommend seeing a Gynecologist to get things checked out I know sounds like the worst place in the world to go but I promise it isnt that bad  I dont know you sexual history but if you have had sexual intercourse You could be having a miscarriage or even worse a Tubal pregnancy If you feel either of these could be the case you need to contact your OBGYN right away If you have not had sexual intercourse there are many things that can affect your cycle I work with prostate cancer patients Muscle pain is not associated with the prostate cancer primarily it is more bone pain when the cancer has metastasized Muscle fatigue is a symptom with certain treatments of prostate cancer Did you ever get this figured out I have the same issue One of the things that you mentioned is the fact that this patient stated that they were taking it 15 minutes before I will say they could consider taking it 30 minutes that extra time actually decrease the bloating and the abdominal cramping However these are common sideeffects with Carafate We probably would refer them back to their physician because Carafate is used in the treatment of healing an ulcer it forms like a bandaid over it So it protects your stomach lining from food and acid If the ulcer is pretty much healed there is a possibility that the patient may not need to take the medication anymore or we need to find that out and refer them back to the physician or healthcare provider to find that out No you cannot take Advil if you are diclofenac They are actually related to each other and are in the same class of what we call an NSAID  nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug so think of them as sisters in a family You can try acetaminophen to see if that helps with the cramps and I recommend talking to your doctor or health care provider about other options is that 23 days after your period ended generally ovulation can begin anywhere from 815 days give or take after day 1 of your period I cant speak to the clinical aspect of your issue but to get your condition checked out without insurance you can try a few things Its possible but your cramps shouldnt be horrible you should see a doctor Also I would occasionally have bright red almost pink on tp  but it was never amount that I needed tamponNever a flow it was just here and there I have headaches indigestion heartburn backaches I took one hpt on Wednesday today morning  but said negative I still have a tiny tiny amount of pink spots with brown I also had light cramps on first after that nothing it didnt even feel like a period i usually take 3 or 4 ibuprofin or drink a special mix drink my friend gave me pour a glass of milk and make a 4th of it evaporated milk put chocolate syrup in it its good and it helps Seems like you really wanted a miscarage If you dont want a baby it is called birth control or plan B if it is too late Yes there is such a thing I dont think people like you deserve to have a baby with a question like that We all know what kind of question that is Do not bring a baby into the world if you are trying to kill it off already Everyone in this world do not need more idiotic people like you to abandon and abuse their kids If you didnt know I will tell you right know that is not right and I look down on you for that If you do want one then dont because you are oviously not ready A muscle cramp is an involuntarily and forcibly contracted muscle that does not relax When we use the muscles that can be controlled voluntarily such as those of our arms and legs they alternately contract and relax as we move our limbs Muscles that support our head neck and trunk contract similarly in a synchronized fashion to maintain our posture A muscle or even a few fibers of a muscle that involuntarily without consciously willing it contracts is in a spasm If the spasm is forceful and sustained it becomes a cramp Muscle cramps cause a visible or palpable hardening of the involved muscle Muscle cramps can last anywhere from a few seconds to a quarter of an hour or occasionally longer It is not uncommon for a cramp to recur multiple times until it finally goes away The cramp may involve a part of a muscle the entire muscle or several muscles that usually act together such as those that flex adjacent fingers Some cramps involve the simultaneous contraction of muscles that ordinarily move body parts in opposite directions Cramps are extremely common Almost everyone one estimate is about 95 experiences a cramp at some time in their life Cramps are common in adults and become increasingly frequent with aging However children also experience cramps Any of the muscles that are under our voluntary control skeletal muscles can cramp Cramps of the extremities especially the legs and feet and most particularly the calf the classic charley horse are very common Involuntary muscles of the various organs uterus blood vessel wall bowels bile and urine passages bronchial tree etc are also subject to cramps Cramps of the involuntary muscles will not be further considered in this review This article focuses on cramps of skeletal muscle Several vitamin deficiency states may directly or indirectly lead to muscle cramps These include deficiencies of thiamine B1 pantothenic acid B5 and pyridoxine B6 The role of deficiency of these vitamins in causing cramps is unknown Activity Authorities recommend stretching before and after exercise or sports along with an adequate warmup and cooldown to prevent cramps that are caused by vigorous physical activity Good hydration before during and after the activity is important especially if the duration exceeds one hour and replacement of lost electrolytes especially sodium and potassium which are major components of perspiration can also be helpful Excessive fatigue especially in warm weather should be avoided How much should I drink Hydration guidelines should be individualized for each person The goal is to prevent excessive weight loss 2 of body weight You should weigh yourself before and after exercise to see how much fluid you lose through sweat One liter of water weighs 225 pounds Depending on the amount of exercise temperature and humidity body weight and other factors you can lose anywhere from approximately 4 to 18 liters per hour Preexercise hydration if needed During exercise Under these conditions adding modest amounts of salt 03 gL to 07 gL can offset salt loss in sweat and minimize medical events associated with electrolyte imbalances for example muscle cramps hyponatremia Postexercise Pregnancy Supplemental calcium and magnesium have each been shown to help prevent cramps associated with pregnancy An adequate intake of both of these minerals during pregnancy is important for this and other reasons but supervision by a qualified healthcare practitioner is essential Dystonic cramps Cramps that are induced by repetitive nonvigorous activities can sometimes be prevented or minimized by careful attention to ergonomic factors such as wrist supports avoiding high heels adjusting chair position activity breaks and using comfortable positions and equipment while performing the activity Learning to avoid excessive tension while executing problem activities can help Rest cramps Night cramps and other rest cramps can often be prevented by regular stretching exercises particularly if done before going to bed Even the simple calfstretching maneuver if held for 10 to 15 seconds and repeated two or three times just before going to bed can be a great help in preventing nocturnal cramps The maneuver can be repeated each time you get up to go to the bathroom during the night and also once or twice during the day Another important aspect of prevention of night cramps is adequate calcium and magnesium Calcium intake of at least 1 gram daily is reasonable and 15 grams may be appropriate particularly for women with or at risk for osteoporosis An extra dose of calcium at bedtime may help prevent cramps Supplemental magnesium may be very beneficial for some particularly if the person has a magnesium deficiency However added magnesium can be very hazardous for people who have difficulty eliminating magnesium as happens with kidney insufficiency The vigorous use of diuretics usually increases magnesium loss and high levels of calcium intake and therefore of calcium excretion tend to increase magnesium excretion A supplemental dose of 50100 milligrams of magnesium daily may be appropriate Splitting the dose and taking a portion several times during the day minimizes the tendency to diarrhea that magnesium can cause The symptoms you describe can be signs of early pregnancy I have no way of knowing if this is it or what your GP suggests which is also a possibility A few days after conception the fertilized egg attaches itself to wall of the uterus This can cause one of the earliest signs of pregnancy  spotting and sometimes cramping Thats called implantation bleeding It occurs anywhere from six to 12 days after the egg is fertilized The bleeding and cramps however are slight Heres more information on pregnancy symptoms Brown discharge is not an uncommon predecessor a day or two before your period starts Yes This could be a sign caused by some major birth control options ie the pill depo shots implants nothing to worry about usually it starts back up on the fourth day It can also be spotting the usual cycle that happens before your actual period If its your usual time of the month and youre NOT on birth control see your doctor other possibilities could be infection

couples do not want to use the IUD because they incorrectly believe that using the IUD will cause either no monthly bleeding amenorrhea or heavier painful and more frequent menstrual bleeding Fact Women can experience changes in bleeding patterns depending on the type of IUD Women using copperbearing IUDs may experience Heavy and prolonged monthly bleeding Irregular bleeding More cramps and pain during monthly bleeding These bleeding changes are normal and usually are not signs of illness They are most common in the first 3 to 6 months after insertion and usually lessen with time A provider should evaluate for an underlying condition unrelated to method use if Cramping continues and occurs between monthly bleeding Heavy or prolonged bleeding continues or if bleeding starts suddenly after several months of normal bleeding or long after the IUD was inserted or Irregular bleeding persists after 6 months or starts suddenly after several months of normal bleeding Severe anaemia requires careful consideration because if heavier menstrual periods are experienced the additional monthly blood loss could worsen existing anaemia The anaemia should be treated before an IUD is inserted The LNGIUD may actually help to reduce anaemia by reducing blood loss Women using the LNGIUD may experience heavy prolonged or irregular bleeding in the first few months but then experience Lighter regular and predictable bleeding Infrequent light or no monthly bleeding These bleeding changes also are normal and usually are not signs of illness Copperbearing IUDs rarely cause monthly bleeding to stop completely However women using an LNGIUD may not experience monthly bleeding due to strong uniform suppression of the endometrium If monthly bleeding does not occur while a woman is using a copperbearing IUD pregnancy should be excluded If the woman is not pregnant other causes of no monthly bleeding should be investigated Pain associated with menstruation may increase in some women but usually this is only for the first month or two The LNGIUD may reduce the pain associated with menstruation Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs may also reduce discomfort Do hope this helps you Good Luck Hi If these cramps are followed by heavy bleeding the yes your on your way to a miscarriage Heres some info it may help you An early miscarriage is the loss of a pregnancy in the first 12 weeks Sadly early miscarriages are very common Its perfectly possible to miscarry before you even realise youre pregnant Perhaps as many as threequarters of all fertilised eggs are lost in the very earliest days of pregnancy After a positive pregnancy test theres about a one in five chance of having an early miscarriage This is when most miscarriages happen Miscarriage at any stage of pregnancy can be a terrible blow Even if it happens very early on in pregnancy its only natural that it comes as a shock Dont feel youre not allowed to grieve over your loss Do hope this helps you

doctor ASAP or the ER ASAP Good Luck Hi So you have had two episodes of having a period Yes then you need to see either your doctor or your gyno sounds like you hormones could be out of whack Hope this helps you Good Luck Hi Anybody with blood in there stool or urine should go see your doctor ASAP its important that you do that Good Luck Hi Apart from the discharge the rest of your problems could relate to early menopause the only way you can sort that bit out would be to get a blood test done this would show were your hormones are its were your hormones are that will tell you whole you doing The discharge may just be from your last period Do hope this helps you Good Luck Hi They say if you restart your periods its best to go see your doctor ASP Good Luck Hi Yes its quite possible for some women to go through there whole pregnancy having periods its just one of the quirks of nature But like yours only light periods Just for that extra test to make sure go see your doctor Do hope this helps you Good Luck Hi So lets take precum by itself its ok  but if you bf had an ejectulation then the could have been sperm in his urethra then if that was the case then you could be pregnant You seem to be having the signs Hope this helps Good Luck Hi Heres a bit of info I found its interesting being its about recum Can I get pregnant from precum Precum or preejaculatory fluid to call it by its correct name is a clear fluid that appears on the tip of the penis when a man has an erection and is sufficiently sexually excited It is a common misconception that this fluid is semen that has leaked out before the main ejaculation This is incorrect because this fluid is produced by something called the Cowper gland and its purpose is to flush out the penis before ejaculation So can you get pregnant from preejaculatory fluid precum Well as this fluid does not contain sperm it cant by itself cause a pregnancy However as the purpose of this fluid is to flush out the penis it will bring any sperm left in the penis from the last ejaculation to the tip of the penis If this happens that small amount of sperm could cause a pregnancy If the man has urinated since his last ejaculation the urine would have flushed out and killed any left over sperm in the penis which means in this case a pregnancy wouldnt happen The Safest thing is to assume that an erect penis is always capable of causing a pregnancy even before an ejaculation so cover it with a condom before it comes in contact with the vagina Good Luck Hi Well you will have to wait to see if you miss you next period if so then this is the time to get either an HPT done or get a test done at your doctors its only then you will find out Are see just reread above so get to your doctor then On the down side it could be just a missed period they do happen from time to time possible Hope this helps Good Luck Hi I think your find it may take some time if this was 30 years solid with no breaks But then if you have started you menopause early that could also be another reason You could do yourself a favour and go get a blood test that would tell you if its started and show up any other problems Do hope this helps you Good Luck Hi OK I think the best thing you should do is go see your doctor let himher go through things with you but the best thing you can have done is a blood test for your hormones by getting this done it should show your doctor were you are and if your going into menopause Do hope this helps you Good Luck Hi Meant to have come back yesterday after doing research on an other post

problem it could help There are several possible causes of your chest or breast pain You didnt name too many details so Iets try to help you with some guidelines There could be some very trivial cause of your pains You could have pulled a muscle or ligament in the chest wall But if this was your case your pains wouldnt last so long Pain coming from elsewhere can be associated with an underlying problem such as swelling inflammation of the chest wall This is called costochondritis or Tietzs Syndrome Of you must know that also a breast cancer called fibroadenoma could be the cause It could be localized deep in breast tissue so you wont be able to palpate it Best thing for you is to contact your GP as soon as possible Your GP will examine your breasts and take a detailed history of the type of pain you have and how often it occurs Hope this is of some help Good Luck Hi If I was you I would not be sitting around looking for answers you would best getting off to your gyno and let himher

stopped having periods or havent started them by the time you are 1416 years old The medical name for absent periods is amenorrhoea In many cases absent periods are not a cause for concern because some girls simply start having periods later than usual and it is normal for your periods to stop at certain points For example your periods will stop while you are pregnant or breastfeeding or after the menopause  Some types of contraception can also cause you to temporarily stop having periods You should see your GP if youre worried about any problems with your periods so they can try to determine the cause Depending on what your GP thinks may be causing your absent periods you may be referred to a specialist for further investigation and any necessary treatment Stopping having periods after previously having them known as secondary amenorrhoea is relatively common  its estimated to affect around 1 in 25 women at some point in their lives It is more common in teenage girls and younger women and can be much more common in certain groups such as professional athletes dancers and gymnasts Not starting your periods by the expected age known as primary amenorrhoea is much less common Its estimated to affect 1 in every 300 girls and women This is the link httpwwwnhsukConditionsperiodsabsentPagesIntroductionaspx Just copy into google to open and read I do hope this helps

your pins and needles and cramp up is this cramping on the thumb first and second fingers Would this be more of a locking than cramping If so this could be carpal tunnel syndrome have you seen your

unlikely that you are pregnant if your period started the day after having unprotected intercourse I am assuming that it was time for your period to start and that you have regular periods If you have a normal 28 day cycle you are most likely to become pregnant when you have unprotected intercourse approximately 2 weeks before you anticipate your period to start have her checked for appendicitis Ive read the stomach bug Norovirus attacks the small intestine and the body then releases antibodies that kill off the lining of the small intestine to fight off the virus This would probably be shed as mucus in the diarrhea Thats one possibility Talk to your hemotologist and diagestive Doctor about this situation along with your family Doctor Your family Doctor could test you for Diabeties especially if you are sweating heavily at night Your hemotologist would do a blood count test and may request further tests to be performed Your diagestive Doctor would run tests and examine various areas of your diagestive system It is important to talk to all three of your Doctors about this situation do not be scared to ask questions the results could be something minor Your symptoms are very charecteristic of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and what may also be called Trigger Finger My concern would be the other factors The cramping of your feet may indicate another issue which is best addressed by an MD You may be low in certain vitamins  have various malalignments of the cervical vertebrae  but I as well as an MD would certainly need more infoas to where the herniated disc iswas located My guess is that you sit for long periods behind a computer your posture is bad  and you get little exercise You should see your MD for blood work calcium levels and have a nuerological workup I suspect its carpal tunnel from a computer keyboard or other repetitive task Your MD can give you better indications as to what you need to do I have the same problem Did you ever get an answer I got my copper IUD about 2 months ago and I have noticed cramping around my uterus as my bowel movement begins and the pain goes away after the bowel has passed This is such a weird topic but I am a little worried because I never had a problem w cramps and BM before the IUD Leg cramps can be caused by many different things not just muscle spasms Flexeril would not likely help and may be too sedating to use on a regular basis It would be best to be properly evaluated to find the reason Just eating a few bananas a week is not going to solve this problem if you are not sure of the underlying cause The leakage of semen BEFORE ejaculation can definitely have viable sperm so the possibility of pregnancy exists Because you are not using condoms or any other type of contraception you always will need to be concerned A bit of preplanning by using birth control andor condoms would certainly help alleviate the worry and uncertainty I dont know why your husband it getting leg crampsthere can be dozens of reasons but I can tell you that vitamin B12 doesnt cause them He will need to discuss this issue with his medical provider to determine a causeand a solution Remember that men can be stubborn about getting medical care so your encouragement is very important There are plenty of potential sideeffects of Depo Provera but that does not mean you will get them Before chosing any hormonal form of contraception you need to see a medical provider or Planned Parenthood so you can learn about ALL of the available methods for YOU and the one that would be best for YOU You can read all about Depo Provera online Your boyfriend should not be chosing your contraceptive method just because he does not like to use condoms Condoms do more than just prevent unwanted pregnancies They help prevent sexuallytransmitted diseasesDepo doesnt do that I vote that yoru boyfriend continues with those condoms until YOU decide the best contraceptive and STD prevention method for YOU The simple answer is yes but not all cramps are related to menses or menarche the first menses Some cramps are intestinal for instance Just an odd coincidence There would be no medical explanation for this In the world of conception just about anything is possible when you are havinig unprotected sex If this is truly your normal period it certainly would be less likely to be ovulating a day before Because of your prior pregnancy experience I can understand your concern You are wise to be cautiousand it is okay to continue to worry a bit until you have a negative pregnancy test or another normal period Stomach secretions are fluorescent yellow so if you are experiencing rapid transit times the need to defecate soon after eating the yellow gastric juice will often change to green Because you have had these intestinal issues for quite a while it would be prudent for you to see a gastroenterologist so you can determine the underlying reason for your intestinal cramping This problem can most likely be fixed so dont hesitate to seek help from a specialist No it is not normal And three months is long enough to have bleeding while on the birth control pill Basically you may need a higher dose pill to control this breakthrough bleeding If you primary care medical provider is not experienced in doing these adjustments see a gynecologist to get you started on a different oral contraceptive This can be fixed Usually not Leg cramps are due to spasm of skeletal muscles the stomach cramps are smooth muscles an entirely different system I used to be like that I bought ultimate flora 50 billion critical probiotic at vitamin shop its wonderful Lots of things can cause leg cramps including medications and medical conditions The most common causes and the most easily treatable are overexertion dehydration and electrolyte imbalence Do they usually happen at night Try this Make sure you are drinking enough water Get enough potassium calcium and sodium in the right balence This usually means if you are getting that twitchy feeling in your muscles drink extra water and eat a banana or a potato with the skin as well as a calcium supplement or Tums type antacid We usually arent too short on salt If you get a cramp in the middle of the night try to brace your foot against something to keep it from pointing and massage your leg as hard as you can Then get up and eat the banana or potato and drink water If this doesnt work talk to a doctor YOU CAN MY MOM T WAS PREAGANT ON HER PERIOD WITH MY BROTHER FOR 3 MONYH You need to schedule an appointment with a GI immediately Could be some kind of stomach ulcer You could be pregnant I would advise that you either take a pregnancy home test and then go see your Dr or go straight and see your Dr who will examine you and then order some test especially blood test to confirm your pregnancy I wish you the best Sometimes you get so used to a drugpill that it starts to not work anymore it might mean that you should try a different pain reliever but it doesnt hurt to get it checked out just incase No contraceptive method is 100 effective so it is always advisable to take a pregnancy test if you think that you might be pregnant regardless of the type of contraception you are currently using or have used in the past It is best advisable to consult your gyno or use a home pregnancy test kit Source  pharmacysell I had my ovariestubes and cyst the size of a Racquet ball removed in February I did not have this type of bleeding I actually didnt bleed at all from it You should go to the dr to get it checked out First call your doctor and make an appointment right away I had bleeding my first month and I didnt know I was pregnant While your waiting for appointment you could get another pregnacy testIf the test is negative it is very common for women to have a miscarriage on first try especially if having trouble conceiving Also if you were on birth control it could take longer It took me three and a half years after being on the pill for thirteen years Also try not to stress usually most women are successful the second time with no issues This all depends on your health and genetics Good luck and my prayers are with you I believe HCTZ Hydrochlorothiazide maybe a possible one I dont know what preview means but basically it means you have trapped gas or a disease so go strait to the ER emergency room or

had a bubble like movement in my stomach and also had pain then one day pain got so bad I ended up in the er and had emergency surgery on a stranglated herniaYou dont want to wait to long I was in terrible cramping pain worse then labor pains If the pain gets worse you need to see a doctor At least try to see some type of doctor yes there is pain like this Is it possible you could be pregnant I dont want to freak you out but it is a definite possible sign of miscarriage I just went through one  Thank you first of all And yes it felt almost like period cramps only one sided and across my back I get back cramps anyways but I knew I was pregnant Most women who miscarry early on have no idea they just think it was a late period if you start having any tissue like clots come out then you are having a miscarriage but theres no real way to tell if you didnt know you were pregnant hun It could just be a late weird period I hope so go for ct scan or mri of ur full body it will helps u to fined out prblm The Depo shot is not a guarantee that you will no longer have your period andor cramps It works for some more then othersIt could even take more then a few months for it to stop I would strongly caution you to be happy to have your period I was on the depo shot for 55 years and have been off for over a year and a half and my period has still not returned If those are the results your going for then speak to your PCP or OBGYN and see if there are any alternatives I Yeseverytime im pregnant I dont know it because im always having my periodit happened twice You could be dehydrated or it could be a problem with your appendix Went to the ER with similar pain all tests came back negative except CT scan with dye I ended up with CHF  fluid around the heart and fluid in the lungs all this time I thought this was stress because my husband has been dealing with side effects from Septic Shock This was my fourth trip to the ER so dont give up if you feel there is something not right keep having them check you out It can be normal since your body isnt used to the medication yet but there are plenty of different birth controls out there and I would talk to my doctor maybe you need a different pill what foods can help stop muscle cramps or what meds can i take A couple of things I would definitely go see a doctor There are so many things that this could be based on your age your normal cycle etc but the bottom line is you havent had your period in over two months If it was me Id want to understand medically what that is all about Sounds like typical diarrhea to me You should maybe revel in the fact that its just once a year You might want to try and think through what you ate or drank when this happened in the past and stay away from those things If it totally makes you sad you should talk to your doctor I am not a doctor but I get the same thing  my doc told me its trapped gasI bought aloe vera juice  you take 4 ounces  it hhelps alotTass just like water thats why I take it LOL you have to get it fro a health food storeHope this helpsTami  Its probably just constipation A really severe case of it in fact Try taking some TUMS or Rolaids and resting Ive had a pretty bad case as well that lasted 3 hours for two days in a row Try the things if that doesnt work maybe try ibuprofen Mild cramping is normal in early pregnancy If the bleeding gets heavier or the crams get worse I would call you OB right away Trust your gut I you feel its something bad then call Good luck From my own experience it never did with me the six years prior to my rt leg and left foot amputationTake care of your feet though take pepto bismol take pepto bismol When I was on the shot I didnt become fully regular until a year after the last injection If you have been having unprotected sex I suggest taking a test just to be sure Yes it is common to have cramps and some spotting when you have sex during pregnancy If it becomes painful or the bleeding is worse then spotting contact your doctor right away Simvistatin may be your problem Pain and cramps are often caused by statins I had the same problems I was taking 80mg Simvistatin once daily I broke my pills in half lowering my dose to 40mg a day And the pain stopped It wont hurt to try it But dont stop the Statins As they are good for your heart also With a muscle spasm if bad enough you can have bruising and some swelling but to me it sounds like when the muscle spasmed it may have ripped or torn a muscle or tended maybe even closed something off like a blood vessel or artery but you are doing the right thing by making and going to the doctor and specialist it my take some time but Im sure everything well work out great I really hope this helps thank you and good luck to you and yours I used to have problems with my thigh going numb and fall asleep then cramp up if I stood or lay down for a while or in certain positions Over load of potassium in your body It could be a sign of false labor or of early labor Your best move would be to consult your physician No according to depoprovera cl side effect information that i found u can look it up wwwrxlistcom hope this helps I would keep a food diary and see what foods make these symptoms worse It sounds like a food allergy if you are getting headaches You may want to ask a pharmacist to see if these are side effects of the contraceptive Sharp stabbing pains can be gas pains I would avoid or reduce intake of inflammatory foods such as anything deep fried any refined sugar or wheat products and dairy products I have been on an antiinflammatory diet lately and have kept a food diary I found out that I have a problem with almonds as well as corn and that it is best for me to keep cheese consumption to a minimum probably because it is inflammatory Good foods to eat would include fruits and veggies fish avocados which have antiinflammatory effects lentils and foods that have not been highly processed Taking probiotics may also help Keep your blood sugar balanced as much as possible This will help with the shakes So will the diet and probiotics as it will help your body absorb more nutrition As far as the cramps go I think that the contraceptive may be playing a big part in that getting more exercise when you feel well enough to do it may help I dont really know what to tell you about that I dont think the two are related When you have kept your food diary for a few weeks or month s it would be a good idea to discuss it with a doctor They may order some tests or they may be able to give even better advice You may want to discuss the contraceptive first and then go back with the food diary and have a followup with that Your cycle can be effected by anything like stress ectI had my tubes tied and never got pregnant As for perimenapause im 47 and am currently going thru that but your much to young for that thank your lucky stars if your bleeding heavy on and off i suggest you go see your doctor it could be a number of reasons go see your doctor for this it varies in women i had miscarriage and i think my cramps after the surgery was a few days It is possible you are starting menopause To check for this you need to have blood work You can get orders from your primary care physician or gynecologist anything is possible which side is crampy and has the back pain Left side usually signals possibly kidney stone or kidney infection and right side could be an appendix problem I would see your PCP or OBGYN STAT 1 ask your OB for another method of birth control and there are lots of over the counter methods see a pharmacist You probably have high blood pressure toohuh I had real bad periods and have already had a mild stroke I found that if I quit drinking coffee and only have a soda once in a while I felt a lot better I didnt have bad cramps anymore and I didnt get the cists on my overies anymore Try that and see if it helps Good luck Its not likely but still possible Some birth controles can take your periods away completely after a while so that can be something to look into about your birth controle Youre best bet is to make an appointment with your docter though i have a period calculator that tracks my period ive always had a normal period thats why this is bothering me this was helpful though im gonna just have to go to my doctor i think its acid build up that gives the cramp usually athlete having cramp means theyre not physicallyconditionally fit to get muscle cramp Cramp happen when you use muscle that you are not used to or when fatigued if you sweating profusely with muscle cramp dizziness and either shallow or trouble breathing yes it is heat exhaustion Yes oh this is my post i was also nauseated the day before i started my period you can just go to your regular doctor and if its severe theyll recommend you to a specialist sounds like it could be your appendix or your gallbladder I would go to your family doctor or your local ER There are several things that could be causing this but the two most likely would be endometriosis or polycystic ovarian syndrom PCOS As you said that you are an older couple this would be very very unlikely after menopause but you mentioned it is after ovulation The fact that it has happened multiple times leads me to believe that it is endometriosis however the duration of the pain could be a cyst popping caused either by the endometriosis or the PCOS Either way I would head in to see your gyno and explain the situation yes if you are fighting sleep it very well can Is your heading correct Have you really not had a bowel movement in around 2 weeks If this is correct you need to see a doctor pronto You should be having a bowel movement every day or at least every other day And if you have taken that many laxatives and STILL arent having a bowel movement you really need to see a doctor Best of luck I AM NOT A DOCTOR BUT I WILL BE ONE DAY It could be tendonitis or carpal tunnel due to repetitve strain injury You may also get numbness or tingling in the fingers or hand and wrist It can cause the symptoms you are describing If keep having symptoms I would see an orthopedic hand specialist to get diagnosed Marieh9 It is sometimes best to wait 510 days after your missed period to take a home pregnancy test and get an accurate reading Perhaps you should make a date wa gastro dr In the meantime do not drink coke or gingerale to keep hydrated drink your fav flav of gatoraide the fizz in sodas work against you when gasious or nauseus I tried vanilla wafers to hold me over The Rn I spoke to offered that advice my contual projectle vomitting since like march 2013 gives me problems 10 or more days a month Being on long term narcotics is the evil incarnate of my owm making But once I got My Pain pump put in i was on 96less medication and i am now on a controlled release of 8mgm of morphine daily My neighbor figured out that the ambitious new neighbor wasnt a alcoholic and when I see them out side now they dont pretend not to see me Hell they even smile Pickle juice Every football player in America can tell you its great for leg cramps If you had your period  you have no reason to worry Plus its unlikely that you were ovulating at that time a week before your period is well after when youd typically ovulate Its very unlikely that you pregnant Your potassium level is low I had this problem and i went to the dr and they told me most muscle cramps are related to a low potassium level Either get your dr to perscribe you some potassium pills or just eat things with alot of potassium in them and drink gatoradeand or powerade because it has a high potassium level in them I know it helped me take it easy and wait out the cramps like a warm bath it could be just a light cycle you should wait a few and test again It could have just been stress or any medication you were taking This happened to me as well you should go get check by a doctor just to be safe its def sounds like bloating to me best bet would be to ease up on the soda cause soda can make that worse and try not to lay down after you eat so your stomach can break down your food the best it can  you also could have a hernia i have a hiytal hernia and i have to eat slow or i get the same way also doc told me to wait a good half an hour to lay down if im going to also you help with the feeling of being bloated and to boost up digestion stand up after eatting and walk around for a while it helps me also dont eat to late at night try to keep dinner as far from sleep as possible and uptake on water  water is good for everything  hope this helps also for me i wasent normal for more than a year  thats very normal with depo i dont think its anything to worry about  if your trying to have a baby it likely you wont be able to untill a year or so after getting of the shot  i got prego with my son i year and 5 months after getting off the shot  if you are trying its best to take an opk to see of your ovulating again  well there are a number or reasons  hormone changes  you say your having cramps  without blood cause that can happen two weeks after your period  its possible to have discomfort when your ovulating many women have this i myself and in a normal cycle women will ovulate around that time frame 14 days after you frist day of your peroid its different for everyone its also common to not have cramps with some periods for me every other month i have cramps and the other months i dont know im bleeding untill i see it so really i wouldnt worry if you are having unprotected sex you may be prego you also get cramping when the eggs attaches itself  if you think theres a chance of this wait untill the day your peroid is due see what happens if you dont see anything i was say take a test and see what that tells you bare in mind early testing can give you a false negative so you may want to wait a few days more  also if your breasts are tender swollen its another sign you may be prego if the pain worsens and you cant bare it then i would make a call to the doctor but its sounds to me like your prego hope this helps h I believe it is normal for this to happen after starting birth control My daughter was just put on birth control for severe menstrual cramps and her doctor told her spotting and minor cramping was to be expected for the first couple of months while her body was trying to adjust But to put your mind totally at ease just call your doctors office and ask to speak to a nurse USE PAIN PATCH It cant be good Your losing all your iron  see a doctor You might have fibroid tumors Yes Its normal if its a bit erratic I had Endometriosis before a radical Hysterectomy I remember doubling over in pain and it did affect my ability to have a bowel movement You need to be seen by a doctor right away I know you dont want to because of finances but I suggest you go anyway Did they perform a radical Hysterectomy or partial The only way you could be having problems with Endometriosis is if they performed a partial Hysterectomy I finally had to have a radical meaning they took both ovaries as well as the uterus Once this is done you cannot have Endometriosis again Have you ever been tested for endometriosis From what youre describing it seems like a distinct possibility to me No I would ask you if you have been under a great deal of stress recently It sounds like the pain most people get from having an ulcer If you have been under a lot of stress it is quite possible that you have an ulcer in your intestines causing the pain I recommend talking to your doctor and asking if you should have an upper GI test done If you have ulcers you can cure them by taking Slipper Elm Bark pills found at your local natural foods store One per day should be good unless you have more than one ulcer If this is the case take one with each meal for a couple of weeks for either doseage I recommend the pills over surgery If you cant swallow pills the stuff comes in a pwder form that you can mix into a hot beverage or put in a food that can mask the taste It does not have a pleasant flavor Also RELATED to the above question I have not had a period since before my last pregnancy which has been 18 months with no period and no signs whatsoever of having a period or that it is coming yes u could go see a doctor to be for sure I get cramps in my body everyday what can cause this Are you actually waiting on someone to tell you to get to a real doctor If you walked into my office and told me youd never had a period and had the worst crampsYou may be having a blood collection in your pelvis It has to go somewhere What doctor in hisher right mind would put you on BC knowing you had that problem unless you forgot to tell them Is you pelvis bloated Dont mess around with this Go to the ER Get a cat scan How old are you Get your butt in gear girl I had 2 wives and they both had entrometriosis This is where the endrometrium or the lining of the uterus spills out into the abdominal cavity and takes root like a vine in your landscape Not saying this is your problem but its pretty common and its pretty serious The common side effect was painful and pronounced menes We were lucky to have a good doctor who did laprosopic surgeries to burn the implants with my second wife to manage her implants We went about 3 years at one point between laps because she didnt have any symptoms but one day she started pissing pure bloodwith no pain Turns out it had grown around her right ureter and choked off her right kidney killing it Long story short she lost her right kidney and her uterus in one surgery So dont fool around with it Whether its your disease or not just keep it in mind Read all you can about this disease I also have a daughter that started her menes at 8 years old Way too soon obviously Still havent figured that out yet Read all you can Good luck Hi I have had similar experience due to my condition which is hypotuatrisum growth hormone deficient I have that when my testosterone is low hope that helps Period issueare you menopausal or could be I would research effects of various stomach problemsperiod issues on net in case it is caused by some food issue Also antibiotics will do thisprobiotics might fix Yogurt and other food with good bacteria might help Have you tried gas removal things like GasX Hey you never knowno insurance here so I try everything I can before seeing Drso expensive Good luck Go and see your physician This could be multople things such as a bowel obstruction ulcerative colitis or irritable bowel syndrome Better to always be safe than sorry httppmahoneybuythistodayinfo Hi ask your doctor sometimes the period come earlier or it is late for me i take a medicine to have my period If you think you may be pregnant its best to take a test It could be ovarian cysts too They are like cramps and usually the follicular cysts are most painful around ovulation Ive been having the same problem the lady couple days I got the copper iud 3 months ago It starts feeling pinchy and spasming until i go to the bathroom The pain is so bad I have to stop what Im doing to manage it Youre not alone I hope an answer is found soon You are probably just catching the muscle quickly compressing it and then releasing it The muscle can become injured and stay sore for quit a while Try to avoid bending in that manner for a while and try some heat compresses I have CMT CharcotMarieTooth Disease a form of Muscular Dystrophy and drink Schwepps Tonic Water to relieve leg and arm cramps Tonic water contains quinine at low levels I have found that when chilled the Tonic Water tastes similar to grapefruit juice Quinine pills are also available but I have read that gastrointestinal distress can result from the pills I hope this helps you Please make an appointment with your Dr to rule out any potentially serious cause for your symptoms Blood in your stool can be attributed to a number of things so do not be unnecessarily alarmed Chronic fatigue can also be attributed to simple lack of sleep A trip to your Dr should give you the answers that you need It sounds like you may have an absessed tooth This is an infection at the root of the tooth The tooth will look fine An absess can sometimes be felt under the jawchin and can sometimes be seen at the gum next to the tooth A trip to your Dentist would give you the answer and the treatment you might want to try the patchworked great for me You wear it for a week and then change itone week off just like the pill Much easier to remember since it is only once a week Same thing happened to my sister turned out she had a cist on her ovarie that burst during sex lower abdominal pains can be caused by anything the clear discharge with cramps is a sign of an infection bacteria infection urinary tract infection yeast infection etc you should go and see your gynecologist to be on the safe side i would maybe ask the person who gives you the depo shot about it FWIW deduced an iron or protein deficiency led to two bouts of calf cramping causing a severe strain in a ligament or tendon in each of the calves I believe the condition was heightened by strenuous cycling for a three month period before the injury that created a need for more nutrients which I didnt intake and led to the deficiency This was the initial injury I saturated my diet with protein vitamins and an iron supplement which corrected the deficiency But the strenuous activity followed by complete inactivity led to atrophy of the calf muscles It was pretty serious I could pinch a lot of flesh on my calf A slow increase in exercise has corrected the pain and weakness Maybe this report will help someone down the line Is it possible that you conceived Implantation of a fertilized egg can cause bleedingcramping at the same time a woman expects her period It is typically lighter than a regular period but can last a day or two It could mean that you are pregnant If you have had any other major changes medication birth control major stress weight loss etc this could also be another explanation I suppose I would wait another 45 days and take a pregnancy test if conception was possible painful cramps can be an indicator of miscarriage if you thought you were pregnant what were you doing to get kneed in the stomach that hard im going to guess and say u did lose the baby you should see your doctor so you dont get an infection Could be a medicine reaction or poor circulation Ive had this problem for years Ive met young and old alike with this problem The metformin could be the source along with any sleep or anxiety medications taken on the same day There also seems to be a link to the weight loss associated with diabetes and loss of muscle I had the same thing and was told that we have a floating rib I went to therapy they gave me hot packs and sat at the end of a table and reached for a beach ball I left physical therapy and did the same thing at home Recently I had the same thing and had a chest xray and cscan and I have a node on my lung but it still feels just like you described My problem still exists it could just be symptoms of your period Hi I wouldnt be too worried if you have been stressed out lately or had a change in your diet this can cause these things to happen I once had a period be 2 weeks late because of stress hope all is well  Hi not sure what pill ur using but I would talk to your dr because if you are not used to having cramps this bad and now you are it could be a bad reaction to the pills not sure but either way better safe then sorry talk the dr hope u feel better soon  dehydration may be some of the problem "}
