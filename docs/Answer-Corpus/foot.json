experienced both you will recover faster if you use it carefully doing some walking and assisted standing while holding a support a few times a day Progress from here Do not lay in bed for a year Hey dont worry This can be due to following reasons You dont like attending classes You are not interested in homework and dont understand in class So for this try to make yourself attentive in class when you start understanding you will automatically start doing HW as well as feel interested in classes A wide range of extra intestinal complications may compose a portion of the clinical picture Neurological dysfunction is an infrequent but potentially devastating extra intestinal manifestation of Crohn disease Virtually all components of the nervous system both central and peripheral may become involved  At least put up your both feets at a horizontal way with some cusion to help it should lower your swelling Yes RA can cause a lot of problems I would get it checked as soon as possible before it gets any worse It can just being something small and simple and an easy fix But definitely get it checked Possibly but with my experience with scabies is youre more likely to start itching when they burrow However that isnt always the case for everyone My step kids got them and one was itching all the time where as the other didnt start itching until the spots started to show up which means they have burrowed I am not a professional but thats what i was told when i went to the doctor with them Im just looking for what it might beits not swollen just red The 4th and 5th metatarsals are fractured I had an xray done but no one has treated it per se Just want to know what the redness COULD indicate So what did you find out Broken 5th metatarsal Typically these can stay in your system for up to 30 days depending on your metabolism sometimes longer That is for a urine test A hair test can show any substance for up to 6 months to a year depending on hair growth continued The floor is a smooth concrete and provides no cushion so every time I step the pain amplifies I bought doctor Scholls work inserts the result was the same no relief Last night I took my old inserts and put them in with the Dr Scholls inserts hoping it would double the padding but still no relief I take extra strength offbrand tylenol when I get to work and about 1am at lunch which helps very little I am willing to pay for a new pair or steel toe work shoes or work boots I am in the military and the cheap boots they give us never hurt me through all the marching standing and working nearly as bad as this does If you have any Idea what kind of steel toe boots or steel toe shoes that would work for me please feel free to post a link to them I would like the price to be 150 or less but willing to go more if they will stop this awful pain It depends where you live If you have an accessible walkin clinic you should by all means go there and be evaluated Your foot deserves to be evaluated by a medical professional Your local government should be able to provide you with a list of emergency clinics in your area Your medical insurance provider should also be able to provide doctors in your neighborhood Also seek referrals for medical care from friends family and neighbors The walkin clinic may also be able to refer you to family doctor in your neighborhood I live in the state of Florida and walkInclinics to assess medical complaints and minor injuries are common place Three different walkin facilities seem to exist  One of the clinics is typically manned by a physician and a medical assistant who may treat colds coughs infections minor cuts bruises and the like Most of the time appointment are not required Any condition that is suspected to be more serious will be referred to a hospital emergency room to assessed  A second walkin clinic does exist within 2 miles of my home A major hospital has an emergency satellite site and is equipped with a physician trained in emergency medicine physician assistantsat least 6 registered nurses diagnostic equipment like xray machines cat scan machines EKG monitors along with paramedics  emergency medical technicians to draw blood If inpatient services are required a transfer to the major hospital is completed through ambulance transportation  The 3rd walkin emergency walkin situation is located within many major hospitals and are set up to handle most medical problems including heart attacks emergency surgery conditions and inpatient care Although youre underweight what really matters is how you feel The weight of 42 kgs 924 lbs may be ideal for you based upon your age sex and height The Healthy BMI Calculator shows the lower end desireable weight for you to be 979 pounds If you have recently lost significant weight then being assessed by the family doctor for physical  emotional reasons should be your first consideration It is probably a good idea to also discuss any diet programs with your doctor before they are started Here are my weight gaining suggestive actions and comments  To maintain your current weight 1551 daily calories must be consuimed  In order to gain one 1 pound per week youll need to establish a daily caloric intake of approximately 2052  Divide thoes calories to include 55 carbs 1128 proteins 15 308 and fats 30 615  Search online for a daily diet menu that includes at least 2052 calories Do not be tempted to eat junk food in order to take in more calories Instead chose dairy products meats and seafoods nuts and legumes to obtain extra calories  Moderate exercise using resistenance techniques such as weight training will help to increase weight through muscle development Best wishes for your success  There could be a relation between the 2 conditions but the jury is still out Although it is difficult to find clinical studies that produced data with convincing arguments of a relationship internet forums are loaded with individuals who suffer simultaneously from both conditions Some doctors are writing Off Label prescriptions for their peripheral neuropathy patients with medications used to treat bipolar conditions Gabapentin is one medication that seems to have a positive result in treating both disorders Peripheral neuropathy comes in many forms and it not always easily diagnosed In addition to the Chiropractors opinion it may benefit you to see a neurologist have a through physical exam and additional diagnostic testing completed in order to confirm that you have peripheral neuropathy In most cases feet will not shrink Have you lost a considerable amount of weight When weight is lost the weight is lost throughout our entire body including the feet It is not uncommon after losing weight to have a decrease in shoe size Depending on the total weight lost the length of the feet should remain the same but the width shape and contour of the feet may be slightly altered A change in shoe size of  to 1 to 1 foot size might be expected Your change in foot size from a womans size 6 6  to a childs size 2 is very unusual Here are some other causes that may account for a reduction in shoe size Feet can shorten in cases of Neuropathic Joint Disease  also called Charcot Joints  In this condition there is damage to the nerves and the bones crumble  A cause for this disorder may be diabetes Diabetic Neuropathy may affect the nerves of diabetic patients and can cause Neuropathic Joint Disease  This happens mostly in the feet of diabetic patients and may produce little associated pain A sexually transmitted disease syphilis if not properly treated can cause also cause neuropathic joints A rheumatologic condition Scleroderma  can also cause the bones of the fingers and toes to be somewhat shortened Discuss the matter with your primary care doctor who may conduct serum blood and imaging studies to rule out or to rule in medical causes for the change in your feet Your doctor may also refer you to other medical specialists such as a rheumatologist By the way Sharing clothing and shoes with a daughter is one of the wonderful gifts of motherhood Congratulations on the birth of your baby  Here are my thoughts that are intended to be helpful 1 It is not normal to still be in pain two years after surgery 2 Anything is possible but I do not think that you had surgery without the break being repaired But it is very possible that the surgery was not successful or that damage occurred after the surgery 3 You should not be subjected to a life full of pain 4 By the way what happened to the original doctor who performed your surgery That individual had a responsibility to follow you postsurgically 5 You need to see a different doctor one that does take you seriously Taking of an xray would seem to be a necessary diagnostic tool that was not employed Having of an xray is rather routine cost effective and many times can even be done in the doctors office I am surprised at the omission of an xray in your case because doctors today can be held accountable for Failure to Diagnosis It means that your liver is struggling to perform its duties according to your bodys requirements to regulate glycogen and filter toxins Skin discoloration may appear yellowish or jaundice and leg swelling are classic symptoms of liver cirrhosis Bleeding easily increase of blood pressure portal hypertension abdominal swelling ascites and itchy skin are other symptoms Since you have been diagnosed with cirrhosis hopefully the swelling and discoloration symptoms were explained to you in detail I suggest that you notify your hepatic specialist of any changes in your symptoms The sooner that new indicators of the disease have been treated the better the eventual outcome tends to be Best wishes for your recovery Yes limit walking on this injury You may have a fracture or a bone contusion A bone contusion is actually a fracture of the outermost bone layer It can be painful with recovery taking 6 weeks  12 weeks Hopefully you iced and immobilized the injured area soon after its occurrence to reduce the recovery time I suggest seeing your family doctor who may make a preliminary assessment and order xrays If damage is determined you may be referred to an orthopedist for treatment You should also be receiving some medication to reduce any discomfort from painConsider using a cane walker or crutches to complete daily tasks until you see the doctor to make your recovery more bearable  If the foot is extremely painful or badly swollen and you cannot see the doctor in a reasonable time frame a visit to the hospital emergency room is justified Many times symptoms of one disorder such as hypothyrodism are also the same symptoms seen in other conditions Your doctor has probably rechecked your thyroid levels since starting synthriod therapy Your thyroid levels will continue to be monitored 1 or 2 xs per year and the dosage may be tweaked up or down So we may eliminate the thyroid and menapause as causes of your discomfort Some other medical conditions that have symptoms as you describe include iron deficiency anemia blood related cause graves disease endocrine system related Vitiamin B12 deficiency dietary related cause and others I suspect that your doctor will run additional blood studies based upon your symptoms and perhaps refer you to other medical specialists as necessary Yes limit walking on this injury A foot contusion is another name for a bone bruise of the foot Even that term is misleading because a foot contusion is really a fracture of the outermost bone layer It can be painful with recovery taking 6 weeks  12 weeks Hopefully you iced and immobilized the injured area soon after its occurrence to reduce the recovery time Although unusual a foot contusion can take as long as a year to completely heal I suggest seeing a foot doctor to thoroughly exam the injury and make medical recommendations The foot doctor can prescribe special socks that are cushioned and padded shoes to make your recovery more bearable Consider using a cane walker or crutches to complete daily tasks until you see the doctor You should also be receiving some medication to reduce discomfort from pain Shortness of breath is an early symptom seen in congestive heart failure patients Swollen ankles and feet is a more serious symptom and may be evidenced by swollen extremities especially the ankles and by weight gain I have known some congestive heart failure victims to gain as much as fifteen pounds in one day One individual in particular stands out in my mind She was much younger than 85 years old and took Lasix diuretic every day to release excess fluid When swollen extremities and weight gain of at least seven pounds occurred Metolazone known as the turbo pill was added to the daily regimen for a very short period of time until the acute water build up was under control Although gaining six pounds of weight in two weeks is not in itself a medical crisis it is a sign of fluid retention and justifies being assessed in person by a physician Being 85 years old with overt congestive heart failure symptoms puts this person in a potentially life threatening situation Despite the upsetting emotions that a trip to the ER may evoke in this person it is better to be safe than sorry I suggest that you phone her physician first and then take this person to the hospital for treatment Best wishes for this ladys speedy recovery It sounds to me that he might have a problem with his arch or instep I would suggest an orthotic for his shoes Walmart has a machne where you step on a platform and it shows where you need help with your feet It will tell you the number of the orthotic to buy  and they have them right there to purchase You will be surprised all the aches and pains you can have in your body that is from your feet It costs nothing except your buying the orthotic Lasix is a water pill that often causes you to lose minerals in your urine A loss of calcium potassium magnesium or significant dehydration by water pills can cause muscle spasm or crampsxmlnamespace prefix  o opop xmlnamespace prefix  o ns  urnschemasmicrosoftcomofficeoffice op op The drug is dispensed by prescription for conditions like heart failure or hypertension Speak with your doctor and let him know He can order tests that determine whats causing bothersome leg cramps Dry skin is common as we age but conditions such as eczema and psoriasis can also lead to extremely dry and cracked skin Applying a daily moisturizers especially after showering limiting showing time and bathing in warm  not hot water help One major tip is to use skin products that contain petroleum or lanolin These help seal moisture in the skin They also produce a barrier that protects against the loss of natural oils within the skin If the symptoms persist despite these simple tips and a change in your routine its time to see a dermatologist A history and physical is what a dermatologist will look at to determine the cause Occasionally other tests such as a thyroid panel or Vitamin D level may be needed Do you have neuropathy and are you diabetic If you dont about the neuropathy talk to your doctor Also always make sure your A1C is within range That determines if you have diabetes I too am on blood pressure medicine and am very swollen in the legs ankles feet hands and fingers Not so sure that my belly isnt swollen somewhat I just read on WebMD that increasing water and cutting down on sodium and exercising is a big help I just wanted to add that I am on 2 mood stabilizers and was told that the family of drugs can be a reason for retaining fluid One of the side effects is weight gain so yay  Check all of the medicines that you take to see the side effects and then report this to your doctor like I did He cut my medicine in half Im afraid because these meds can also raise my cholesterol and my liver function which are culprits for edema as well I think Are either of you allergic to other meds Seems like my body has changed and am having allergic reactions to Chantix and Cipro and have been allergic to NSAIDS since 2005 had to go to the hospital because of the swelling in my throat  tongue Ive never had food or drug allergies before Ive also been told that Im menopausal now and that could be part of my weightgain problem but I think a lot of it is swelling Hope that we all get the swelling under control its very aggravating and causes pain in those areas after a while Go see MD ASAP My son had what we thought was a spider bite on his leg It did the same thing got very red and painful It ended up being MRSA Had to get my son on antibiotics fast Warm compresses will bring the puss up to the surface but the puss is very contagious MRSA is very common now but can be fatal Dont wait Better to be safe than sorry I think you might want to talk to a doctor about this especially if its happened more than once I dont know what other health conditions you might have Ill assume none or your fitness level but at 18 feeling lightheaded with a rapid heart rate doesnt sound normal not least of all since you said it was very sudden It could like a lot of scary events be something relatively minor but it would probably be best to get it checked out just in case Inflammation of the tendon in the foot It helps immensely to use a small hard ball tennis ball and roll the arch of your foot back and forth on it It helps stretch and relieve some of the ache from the tendon being inflamed What is your question regarding neuropathy Wow  sounds like some form of edema  I would definitely have her see a doctor Soon For your any dental problem plz click here  confidentdentalcare  For your any dental problem plz click here  confidentdentalcare  For your any dental problem plz click here  confidentdentalcare  For your any dental problem plz click here  confidentdentalcare  For your any dental problem click here  confidentdentalcare I used to work jobs where I was on my feet 1216 hours a day too It seems like such a simple fix but there are 3 things that I did that really helped me a lot 1 I did keep at least 3 pair of shoes with me all the time and changed at the first sign of pain 2 Inside each pair I kept and still do some Dr Scholls gel shoe liners You may want to try different ones to see which is best for you but they make a world of difference 3 This is more of a suggestion because due to back problems I cant wear them anyway But I wouldnt wear heels any higher than one inch Our bodies werent designed to be standing on our toes all the time as you do in heels and they will cause foot leg and back pain over time Another thing When you get home soaking your feet in warm epsom salt water is heavenly I read this somewhere and tried it I dont know if it was in my head or not but it really did help I also rubbed the Vicks on my chest too though which helped with the congestion which also helped with the cough So I dont know if rubbing it on my feet helped or not but I do know that rubbing on my chest helped YES YES I have had neuropathy for 11 years now I have had six surgeries in left foot to either remove nerves or cut them I have also had injections into nerves to permanently kill them Each time I was told this would help NOT The best thing I have found so far unfortunately is medicine Is there a great amount of pain from them If so you need to see a podiatrist first he or she will point you to a Neurologist Plantar fasciitis PF is a painful inflammatory process of the plantar fascia theconnective tissue or ligament on the sole bottom surface of the foot It is often caused by overuse of the plantar fascia increases in activities weight or age It is a very common condition and can be difficult to treat if not looked after properly Longstanding cases of plantar fasciitis often demonstrate more degenerative changes than inflammatory changes in which case they are termed plantar fasciosis 1 The suffix osis implies a pathology of chronic degeneration withoutinflammation Since tendons and ligaments do not contain blood vessels they do not actually become inflamed Instead injury to the tendon is usually the result of an accumulation over time of microscopic tears at the cellular level Look up Plantar fasciitis  Wikipedia the free encyclopedia  I would see a NerologistI may not have spelled that correct but they help with nerve problems A definite break I think that they do work but they should be done with caution If you have an underlying medical condition such as diabetes where you might be more prone to infection you have to be very careful using these products because a break in the skin can lead to infection and that can be very serious So you have to be careful in how you use it and try not to go so far as to cause bleeding or a break in the skin But used properly under the right circumstances they can be very effective at paring down the skin in a gentle way This is a very common problem When your foot is wet and you go into an environment where its likely that there is some fungus everywhere on the floor its very hard to avoid So the first and the most important thing is to try to wear either flipflops or water shoes when walking as opposed to going barefoot around the pool or the locker room shower To treat it you can use overthecounter antifungals to help knock the foot fungus out If that doesnt work then you can see a dermatologist who can even give you a prescription medication either a cream or even a pill to help clear it Some people are more prone to foot fungus than others So once you have it you might be prone to getting it again over time There is also a powder that you can put into your shoe thats very absorbent that helps prevent water from accumulating which  that water moisture and dark occluded environment is just ideal for that fungus to grow So you want to create an environment thats not so fungus friendly and also treat the underlying cause and hopefully that will help keep it at bay for a long time f you have an itch from the foot fungus that should get better within a few days To clear it can take up to two weeks Then you want to keep using the powder in the shoe to help absorb any moisture and sweat from the foot and also change your shoes more frequently Dont wear the same shoes everyday because that again can create an environment where that fungus grows more readily Well dermal fillers can add somewhat of a cushion but this would be a very special small population that would really truly benefit from this Chances are you need to wear less of those heels which I also love I mean I get it we are women we like to wear those shoes But sometimes we really have to balance and wear a greater variety of shoes to eliminate that problem or to see a neurologist to see if there is an underlying problem with the foot thats causing that pain Dermal fillers in that area generally dont last very long because of the pressure on the foot over time it would wear off very quickly So for the amount of money it would take to have that result you would have to do it too much over time and I dont think its very cost effective Often proper hydration alone can make a very big difference in the smoothness and softness of the feet Often proper hydration alone can make a very big difference in the smoothness and softness of the feet The only reason to avoid Body pain is to take proper and regular exercise Dont forget to maintain Diet Chat Simply go through Natural treatment Natural treatment or organic treatment is one of the best solution to cure Spider Bit Baking Powder and some components include vitamin C and Salicylicacid are consider the best home remedies for treatment First great job on taking steps to help control your diabetes through diet Its not easy and you should be congratulated for taking this step Gluten is a protein found in wheat and related grains including spelt barley rye and others I dont know of any studies that look specifically at a glutenfree diet for diabetes management Historically people with or gluten intolerance have needed to adopt a glutenfree lifestyle Today many people have decided to give glutenfree a try whether for weight loss or to see if it helps conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome These connections are still being investigated and theres no conclusive scientific evidence yet that eating glutenfree is beneficial to anyone other than those with celiac disease or gluten intolerance If you do decide to try living a lifestyle remember you still need to get an adequate amount of fiber and whole grains in your diet If you opt to eliminate wheat and related grains you need to replace them with other whole grains such as brown rice While theres no evidence that eating glutenfree aids in weight loss or is advantageous for any medical conditions beyond celiac disease its also not a harmful way to eat Hope this helps Im sorry to hear what youre going through Its probably rather alarming Some swelling of the feet and ankles is common with pregnancy However if you have been diagnosed with and this swelling is new I would suggest you contact your OBGYN to let him or her know of this development The fluid retention in your lower limbs may be nothing to worry about And then again it might be Your best bet is to not try diagnosing this yourself Let your doctor do it If youve been diagnosed with preeclampsia and experience sudden swelling of the hands arms or face then you should contact your doctor right away Wishing you and your baby well Im sorry to hear youre going through this Anxiety is no fun no matter what causes it I suggest you investigate CBT This type of therapy is issuebased and is designed to help resolve issues like yours quite quickly  often in four to five sessions If that sounds impossible take it from me It can happen In a nutshell cognitive behavioral therapy helps you recognize the early symptoms of in your case an anxiety episode coming on so that you can disrupt your bodys physical response to the trigger You already know your trigger heights Since you cant avoid the trigger CBT will teach you how to change your thought patterns and behaviors to derail the panic attack before it can get started It sounds easy and it actually can be easy  with some practice You can find many therapists who specialize in CBT I urge you to find one and get started soon because theres no reason for you to continue limiting your life and experiencing the nasty symptoms of a panic attack for even one more day Wishing you well I suggest you take your daughter to her pediatrician as a starting point Her symptoms should not be ignored If the symptoms seem to come and go with her menstrual cycle the problem could be anemia from blood loss Drinking extra water and eating ironrich foods red meat fortified grains might help the problem However many things could be causing these dizzy spells and its important you find out whats going on If theres an underlying illness or condition the sooner you can treat it the better Wishing you well Im sorry to hear youre going through this Painful knees are no fun This is something you should have evaluated by a health care provider You can start with your primary care provider While its possible you simply have some arthritis or some inflammation related to doing chores on your knees its also possible you injured your knee Your symptoms could be caused by a variety of knee injuries including a dislocated kneecap Ouch The mere fact that youre having severe inflammation shooting pains and burningstinging sensations indicate you need a physical examination by a health care professional He or she may want to order some tests such as Xray or MRI to help figure out whats going on I wish you all the best in getting bck on your feet literally Im sorry to hear about your accident Its always painful to injure the ankle Unfortunately its impossible to diagnose a broken bone without Xrays Even in an exam room a medical provider may not be able to tell by looking if the ankle is broken or not The fact you can put your full weight on the joint and have good range of motion makes me think its probably just sprained If the swelling goes down and the pain decreases then you can be pretty sure it was just a sprain The bruising may take quite awhile to clear up and the joint may be painful for some time Soft tissue injuries can take awhile to heal completely If youre still having trouble with the foot after a week to 10 days then it would be worth seeing a doctor Perhaps he or she will want to get an Xray simply to rule out any fractures Wishing you well Great question Im glad you asked because many others will benefit You should be just fine taking this combination of medications You may feel drowsier than normal And anyone who is taking a narcotic hydrocodone should either not drive or else be very cautious when driving because driving under the influence of narcotics is prohibited in many states and local jurisdictions In general though youre not at high risk from taking this combination of meds at these dosages In the future Id recommend you ask your health care provider about possible drug interactions at the time youre prescribed a narcotic Also you can always consult a pharmacist for advice I hope your ankle heals quickly Im not trying to alarm you but you need to seek immediate medical attention Although you have a family history of COPD the symptoms you describe point to something else  a heart issue The GOOD NEWS is most heart issues can be wellmanaged over the long term with early diagnosis and treatment I urge you to have a friend drive you to the emergency room You need to get yourself into the hands of medical professionals Wishing you well Im sorry youre going through this It sounds awful I have to state though that are not diagnosed by biopsy This makes me question whether or not youve actually seen a medical professional about the situation Regardless the fact your partner now exhibits the same symptoms means you both need to get to a doctor  sooner rather than later Its possible you have some systemic internal disease process that requires attention Sinec the situation has been going on for some time and you do not report any problems breathing or with swelling inside your throat I suggest you seek nonemergency medical attention as soon as possible Wishing you well Unfortunately genetics generally determines how tall we will grow At age 19 youre not likely to gain any more height That said you might consult with your primary care provider to see if there are any options available to you that Im not aware of even the best nurse cant know about every new development in medicine Sometimes endocrine problems can cause people not to grow but these issues usually are identified and treated early on such as when puberty starts I wish I had better news for you Im sorry to hear youre going through this Let me take your second question first Youre not getting any directly from the weld flash Its true that exposure to low levels of ultraviolet UV radiation such as from sunlight promotes Vitamin D synthesis creation if you will in the skin its doubtful youre exposed to enough UV radiation from weld flashes to cause an overabundance of Vitamin D production This is especially true if youre covering your skin with appropriate protective clothing As to your first question while its possible you have a bone spur on your heel the most common cause of heel pain is a condition called PLANter fasheeEYEtiss The good news is you can take steps at home to relieve your heel pain if it is in fact caused by plantar fasciitis That will save you a trip to the doctor include resting your feet icing your heel wearing a night splint and more If youre not allergic to any medications you probably are safe to take an overthecounter pain remedy like ibuprofen too If the home treatments for plantar fasciitis dont clear up your heel pain then Id suggest you see a medical professional Its possible you have a strained ligament or even a stress fracture Good luck Unfortunately theres no way to tell you whats causing the numbness without a physical examination and possibly an Xray or some other diagnostic imaging Many conditions could cause the symptom youre describing though the likely culprit is a compressed or pinched nerve Even though you only wear low heels the shoes could be at fault However your best bet is to visit a doctor to get this checked out Its probably not anything serious but you dont want to permanently damage a nerve by ignoring the situation Hope this helps Aw poor baby And poor mom having to go through this I would not recommend selftreating this I would do as the doctor said and wait to see how your son is doing in 5 days Your doctor has very good reasons for recommending your sons foot not be casted immobilized for a period of time Its possible that immobilizing the limb by using something like a walking boot could cause muscle atrophy shrinkage which would be damaging to your son If you have any questions about why your doctor recommended taking a waitandsee approach then Id suggest you call and ask him In the moment of crisis when youre in the ER and feeling anxious about your babys health its easy to forget to ask questions Your doctor wont mind if you call and find out exactly why hes taking this approach with your son Best wishes to you and the little one If youve been on blood pressure medication for two years and the cold feet are a new symptom then its unlikely your medication is the cause However any new symptom is a good reason to visit your health care provider and get checked out Low blood pressure can cause cold hands and feet but its relatively uncommon More often cold feet are caused by poor circulation This in turn can be caused by many other things such as diabetes  or even  Your best bet is to see your health care provider to discover whats causing your cold feet After a physical exam your provider might order a few more tests to get to the bottom of this  and help get your feet warm again Well thats no fun You figure to pain with surgery not create more right Its entirely possible your gait changed after you had back surgery Gait refers to the way you walk how your weight is distributed on your legsfeet the length of your stride and so on A change in your gait could certainly contribute to the symptoms you describe The most common cause of heel pain is a condition called pronounced planter fahsheEYEtiss Plantar fasciitis is an annoyance but not a serious disease Your health care provider can tell you whether or not you have plantar fasciitis or some other problem with your foot He or she also should be able to tell you if this is related to your back surgery Id suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider to start with Good luck to you Whenever a person hits an extremity hard enough to break the skin we become concerned about a possible  Your friend probably would be welladvised to head for an urgent care facility for an Xray especially given the level of bruising you describe Meanwhile your roommate can elevate her foot apply a compression bandage like an Ace wrap for moderate compression dont wrap it too tightly and apply ice packs to the foot These steps  the socalled RICE approach for Rest Ice Compress Elevate  may help reduce swelling which hinders the bodys healing response I hope your roommate feels better soon Hm Well thats an interesting question Im sorry youre having this problem when youve just begun an activity that should be for your health not viceversa Id recommend you get this checked out by a physician Many things could be causing the symptoms you describe Only a physical examination can begin to solve the mystery Best wishes on your fitness routine and I hope your leg problem gets resolved soon Im sorry you experienced this It sounds scary The good news is people usually dont just drop dead suddenly in the manner you describe I wonder if you mean you felt lightheaded when you got out of bed This is not uncommon It can be caused by a blood pressure change from lying down to standing If you continue to have episodes like this please see a health care provider A physical examination will help discover the cause of the problem It also will give you peace of mind Take care I would suggest you have this checked out by a medical professional I dont think the symptoms you describe have anything to do with the injury to your toe If the toenail had been severely injured it would have fallen off by now Otherwise any injured area probably would have grown out and been clipped off over the course of a year Also a toe injury on one foot obviously wouldnt affect the toe on the other foot This tells me something else is going on here And youll need a physical examination to discover what that something else is Hope this helps Im sorry to hear your husband is going through this It sounds very distressing for both of you Despite the negative test results Id urge you not to give up Some conditions evolve over time and may take repeated testing to identify Id suggest you make a followup appointment with your husbands primary health care provider to discuss these symptoms and how theyve progressed  or swelling of the legs and arms often is occurs when the veins arent working properly to return blood to the heart Blood pools in the veins and some of the fluid component of the blood seeps into the surrounding tissue causing swelling Very often excessive salt intake contributes to edema Your husband might consider reducing his salt intake Read food labels carefully youll be surprised how much sodium is lurking in there Smoking cigarettes also can contribute to poor circulation especially in the legs If your husband smokes Id suggest he seek medical help to quit Hope this helps Im sorry to hear youre going through this is no fun thats for sure The only way youll find out the answer to your question is to ask Somnolence sleepiness is one of the main side effects of opioid pain relievers like morphine and oxycodone Often the first treatment for excessive somnolence in opioid users is to reduce the dosage If thats impossible in your case then your doctor may consider prescribing something to offset the drowsiness If youre experiencing severe sleepiness due to opioid use you need to be extremely careful about driving cooking for example using knives or a food processor operating machinery or any tasks that require keen awareness You also need to make sure youre not so highly medicated that your breathing slows or stops Regularly check your lips to make sure they dont have a bluish tint around the edges and make sure your finger nailbeds stay pink as well If you see any bluishness around your mouth or in your nailbeds you should contact your doctor right away as these can be signs of an accidental opioid overdose I just want to add that your pain should not keep you bedridden You should do everything you can to stay active whether this means using crutches a cane or even a wheelchair But dont stay in bed because then youre putting yourself at risk for a blood clot And you dont need that on top of everything else Good luck to you Im sorry to hear of your health woes can be nasty things to deal with I certainly hope youre under the care of a medical professional Both the lump below the jaw and the weight loss would concern me and Id suggest you visit your primary health care provider to find out whats going on A number of conditions can cause those symptoms so you need a diagnosis and possibly treatment Wishing you all the best Im sorry youre experiencing this Unfortunately its impossible to diagnose a skin ailment without a physical examination I suggest you make an appointment to see your primary care provider He or she can look at the bumps and tell you what they are and whether or not they need to be treated Weird bumps on the feet arent unusual because the feet take a beating from walking and get exposed to all kinds of viruses and bacteria that may be lurking on floors in carpets and so on Fortunately most of these bumps arent serious and dont cause much harm  other than looking funky Your primary care provider can tell you whats going on and refer you to a foot doctor if necessary Good luck You need to get this checked out by a medical professional as soon as possible The symptoms you describe could be due to an infection or a blood clot and both of these need to be treated quickly Either call your doctors office and explain to them whats going on so they can get you an appointment soon or go to an urgent care facility Im hoping the underlying cause of your symptoms is nothing serious but please dont delay getting this checked out All the best to you Im as confused as you are I dont see how any health care provider can say a disease process doesnt exist if they havent done the appropriate testing However if your internal medicine doctor has done any blood work on you recently I would assume he or she did in fact test you for  since youd been previously diagnosed I think the key here is communication Id suggest you make another appointment with your internal medicine provider to discuss your concerns and confusion over the situation If your provider has blood test results he or she should be happy to share them with you If not you may ask again to be tested since youre symptomatic If you dont get satisfaction from this provider feel free to find another one Its important to have a primary care provider who listens to your concerns and takes time to explain the answers to your questions All the best to you If this is a recent development my concern would be whether or not youre checking your sugars regularly and keeping them controlled It was traditionally thought that many people with Type 2 diabetes would never develop because it takes quite some time to come on However were seeing more of this in patients with Type 2 for various reasons including late diagnosis and people living longer with Type 2 If this is a new symptom Id recommend you make an appointment with your health care provider He or she may want to make changes to your medication regimen Meanwhile you should proactively take charge of your diet and exercise routines check your sugars regularly and avoid drinking alcohol If youre overweight work on getting your weight down That will help your Type 2 overall By the way great job on checking your feet regularly Foot ulcers are nothing to fool around with when you have diabetes Take care Im sorry to hear youre going through that Leg pain can be so uncomfortable Its hard to tell exactly whats going on without a physical examination but my best guess would be  This annoying condition can affect people who jog for exercise but they also can hit people who just once ran to catch a cab or something If the problem is shin splints the best advice is not to perform the activity that causes the pain So if this is occuring because youre walking fast for exercise try slowing down your pace If it just occurred randomly from a single activity like catching that cab then probably just resting the leg will allow for healing There are more tips at the link above Hope you feel better soon Im sorry to hear youre suffering with this Pressure ulcers especially on the feet can be hard to heal and painful too If youre seeing a wound care specialist next week then I think youre probably OK If youve been dealing with this since May Im sure youve been taught how to care for the wound keep it clean and apply a dressing If something about the wound has suddenly changed such as your whole foot swelled up and turned red andor hot or if you have developed red streaks running away from the wound or if youre running a fever then I would suggest you call your wound care specialist as soon as possible All of those things could point to a developing infection and youd want to get that looked at quickly Otherwise Id try to keep the leg elevated and of course keep pressure off the wound area Your wound care specialist will take it from there I wish you all the best Im sorry to hear youre going through this Foot pain can make it unbearably hard to get around Your case study is very interesting Ive never heard of foot pain related to heart issues But since youve been through this before Id suggest you listen to that inner voice thats telling you your foot pain may be related to some new development with your heart and make an appointment with your cardiologist to evaluate the situation With luck this symptom wont turn out to be related to your heart But if it is at least youll have caught it early All the best to you Hm You raise an interesting question Its true that broken bones may be more prone to developing arthritis It helps to understand that which is what were talking about here doesnt necessarily mean the development of painful bony spurs in a joint which is what a lot of people think Technically osteoarthritis refers to the raw edges of two pieces of bone rubbing together painfully We usually think of osteoarthritis as something that comes on gradually over the course of years because that is how the disease usually progresses in healthy tissue Osteoarthritis is called the wear and tear disease because under normal circumstances the cartilage between bones in a joint wears away over the decades until the two pieces of bone grind against each other However the course may be different for osteoarthritis caused by trauma such as a broken bone Id suggest you sit down with your doctor and have him or her define arthritis for you so that you understand better what theyre talking about They should also be able to explain in very clear terms how it is arthritis could develop in your foot so quickly I hope this information helps Unfortunately its impossible to tell why this is happening without more information and a physical examination I would suggest however that you consult a medical professional about this Whenever the nails toes or fingers turn purple its usually a sign of decreased oxygen supply often due to decreased blood flow If this is happening to you on just one side it could indicate a circulation problem in your leg And that is definitely worth getting checked out If the purpleness comes and goes try to get a picture of it when its occurring This will help your health care provider better understand whats happening if youre not experiencing the problem when you go to your appointment I wish you all the best I applaud you for wanting to exercise more Thats almost always a good thing I suggest you consult your health care provider about your leg issues Many conditions can cause the symptoms youre describing and if its something benign like simple of the legs then walking despite the pain could well fix the problem But your best bet is to see a medical professional for a diagnosis and to get cleared for exercise I hope youre on your way to better health and painfree living soon I suggest you get this checked out by a medical professional Many conditions can cause the symptoms you describe but one that comes to mind is a  Obviously if thats the case you want to get treatment as soon as possible Itching is not normally a sign of Staph infection but it still would be good to rule this out At any rate youre having abnormal symptoms that are worth getting checked Meanwhile be sure to wash your hands thoroughly and often In the event you have some sort of communicable infection you want to take every precaution not to transmit it to someone else I wish you all the best Im sorry to hear youre going through this Few things are as painful as leg cramps Two common causes of lower leg cramps are dehydration and low potassium levels in the blood So your first potential solution is to simply drink more water If you have high blood pressure you should consult your physician before you substantially increase your water intake but in general drinking a few extra glasses of water a day isnt going to hurt you If you have high blood pressure and take a water pill diuretic you should find out if it is a potassiumsparing type of not If your diuretic is not potassiumsparing you should be taking a prescription potassium pill Again if youre uncertain about these things you should consult your doctor I dont recommend people run out and start taking potassium supplements which you can buy over the counter to cure leg cramps Potassium is a key mineral for heart function and overdosing on potassium can cause serious heart rhythm abnormalities However eating potassiumrich foods like sweet potatoes tomato sauce and whole beans like navy beans or pinto beans not only will increase your serum blood potassium levels to possibly help the leg cramps but they will be dietfriendly for your diabetes Everything Ive told you here is based on the assumption you dont have a lot of other health issues besides the diabetes going on and that you dont take a lot of medications Many medications and coexisting medical conditions can cause lower leg cramps So its always a good idea to let your medical professional know whats going on Wishing you well his pediatrician has referred to a pediatric orthopedic doctor we have not gone yet i just dont want any surprises and to be educated on any choices i may have to make or treatment he may receive I have similar issues with my right knee too but not to the extent that you have Sounds like it may be Neuropathy At first you may notice numbness tingling abnormal sensations or pain in your feet Some people feel like they have socks on even though they are barefoot Over time this feeling spreads to your legs and hands May be neuropathy or plantar fascitits  Sources dont get that online go to a doctor before taking any sort of hormones look here before httpwwwhumangrowthhormonehghnet The only reason to cut it off is if it is infected otherwise there is no reason to reopen the wound Signs of infection are redness swelling very sore  foul odor Signs of healing is continuous itching  some tenderness At times this is caused by a pinched nerve need test to be done to be sure No This technic is used in ERs for wounds that bandages didnt work so well  Losing weight and having bad feet do not necessarily justify a diagnosis of Diabetes Symptoms such as chronic intense thirst and frequent urination may be a cause of some concern and a visit to your Doctor may be in order He may want to do some bloodwork and check your H1C to evaluate your blood sugar level The H1C Test is a blood sugar average over the past 3 months Many people get Diabetes Type II because they are overweight and their bodies cant produce enough Insulin As a result the sugar stays in the blood instead of migrating to the cells You see Insulin produced in the Pancreas is the Key to unlock the cells so that the sugar may enter The symptoms Ive described above are the precursors and warning signs of a possible Metabolic change going on inside the body The feet of a person with Diabetes need to be checked every day for cracks or pressure ulcers These can lead to infections if not attended to immediately Clean the feet and apply lotion Eat right That means a Balanced Diet Do Not Overeat Have 5 small meals over the course of the day perhaps 3 small meals and 2 snacks Exercise 20 to 30 minutes per day Ask your Doctor for the best type of exercise for your current body condition Enjoy Life and be Happy no Salicylic acid is available at drug stores for wart removal However if the wart is in a very callused place you may want to have your health care professional freeze the wart off with prescriptionstrength medication Sanding the skin down can flake off the wart and transfer it to another location on the body Seek medical advice for the quickest safest removal Claritin and Zyrtec are not used to treat the itching associated with a foot rash Without seeing the foot rash it is difficult to help in selecting an overthecounter medication for treatment The most common type of foot rash is athletes foot which is caused by a fungus Symptoms include red itching burning areas and sometimes dry white flakes The burning itch associated with the foot rash is treated with antifungal medication Please note having an itch does not always mean that an allergy medication is going to alleviate your symptoms Medications are intended to work for the cause of a specific condition You need to use the appropriate medication for the actual condition Seeking medical advice informing another healthcare professional and asking a pharmacist about all the symptoms that are involved can help to correctly identify and treat your condition you probably support most of your weight on the foot Its probably just stress on the bones and joints I have problems with my right ankle when i stand on it for to long and im flat footed as well I would suggest getting an ace bandage the brown stretchy ones and wrapping your ankles before going to work It will give you more support dont wrap them to tight or youll cut off circulation but do it comfortably tight If that doesnt help then try jell insoles I hope this helps This is a difficult question to answer as it will all depend on how things go Your friend may need to change some things initially during the recovery period However there is a very good chance that she will have no long lasting effects from the surgery though this somewhat depends on what part of the colon is going to be removed I would recommend that your friend talk to her surgeon to be sure she knows what to look out for Maybe you are running in a way that makes your foot hurt Id go to a running shop and get the right shoes for your gait Or maybe consider going to an orthopedic doctor to get things checked out you might need to be referred by your GP Sounds like the diagnosis is right My daughter had it for 2 weeks and only on gums tongue and lips Never on her hands or feet Very painful but it did go away She was 2 though can get anywhere Raising your feet can sometime be helpful in mobilizing fluids in cases of congestive heart failure But a careful diuretic regimen is key to success as is watching salt and fluid intake closely Go see a chiropractor its an offer but not too many believe Gout almost always starts with pain in one of your big toes Gout is a build up of too much uric acid in the body and the pain is first felt in one of the big toes or both The symptoms you are describing sound more like a condition called neuropothy a painful condition caused by over active nerve endings Ask your doctor if it could be that it doesnt sound at all like gout to me I would It may just be a bruise but you could have chipped or cracked a bone Well when you are prediabetic you are being introduced to diabetes People think that diabetes is not so serious and is just a little sugar and that is not true Diabetes is really when the body cant process sugar Diabetes can sometimes lead to obesity That is when the body builds up dangerous amounts of fat When you have diabetes you are going to have pain in your knee So you should check in with a doctor and tell him or her that you have diabetes Or you are prediabetic Nope you will not be able to play if you just leave the pain You must see your doctor and tell himher what you have The doctor should give you something for your foot And another thing you can do is rub carbon peroxide liquid to kill the microorganisms that might make the cut worse and that can make you sick And another thing that you can do is see your doctor and tell him or her that you have a cut on your toe and your experiencing a painful condition This just happens to me at night I dont know the answer but I can tell you that my friend keeps her feet in ice while she gets chemo so that she doesnt get problems with her feet I suggest asking about it at your next treatment As long as the chemo doesnt need to get to your feet you should be able to do that It restricts blood flow to the feet and blood flowchemo flow She also did the same with her hands Hope this helps Best of luck and keep fighting wound care yes but you need to see a MD for possible antibiotic treatment I would not recommend giving any Benadryl at this time for the itchy feet If your son was allergic to amoxicillin he would have developed a rash all over his body and it usually happens right after the first or second dose I would recommend using a moisturizing cream on his feet to help keep the skin on his feet moist and may also help with the itching I would not recommend putting super glue on a cut It can actually trap in bacterial and cause an infection Due to the fact that glass was involved I would highly suggest taking him to a doctor or health care provider to make sure the cut is not infected and advise them what was put on the area Skin infections can be hard to treat so take it seriously This is normal Your body is cold so it compensates by decreasing blood flow to your extremities hands and feet The redness and swelling is your body trying to warm its extremities by increasing blood flow The rewarding phase does hurt and depending on how cold you were it may hurt A LOT For me I get cold toes and fingers from the house being 68 degrees Put on some socks and a jacket or more layers if needed It could be athletes foot Try some of the athletes foot ointments or sprays from your local pharmacy and see if that helps Also try to keep your footfeet dry wear socks and make sure you stay nice and clean You might try going for an evaluation at a communitybased health clinic They offer comprehensive healthcare services on a sliding fee scale You can find a clinic by searching the US

Department of Health and Human Services httpfindahealthcenterhrsagovhelp The pain can be go from the bottom of your foot to just to the bottom of your ankles ice will relieve the pain 20 minutes on

you a diagnosis neurologist Sorry it may be a little late but see the response I just sent oilman2022 When i was a teenager I was on that finally got off it cause ALL I did was sleep even though I was sickly I still wanted a somewhat normal life and NOT SLEEP all the time At your age darlin I would say NO Have your parents take you to a foot specialist and possibly have special orthopedic shoes made Good luck God Bless Either you have a bladder infection or a urinary tract infection I would go to the doctor and start there first If you are sexually active that could be a whole new ballgame but take the simplesteps firstr cause that seems to be waht it is Adderall is not associated with the side effects you mentioned MS Contin may cause swelling of the hands and feet as a side effect

are stuck in one place It is a PD symptom and a very difficult problem to treat Rarely it is associated with a high dosage of a dopamine agonist like Requip or Mirapex and can improve somewhat with a reduction in these medications It also may respond a bit by visual cues  and she can practice stepping over a line in the floor  or by marching President Harry Truman was thought to have PD in his later years and would march to a cadence for his daily walks  but had trouble with walking at other times I would also suggest that she have some physical therapy by a therapist with experience in PD

include fever sore throat and blistering sores in the mouth that become ulcers A rash may appear on the palms and soles of the hands and feet HFMD is spread through viruscontaminated secretions from the nose throat saliva or blister fluid A person can still transmit the virus to others for weeks after symptoms resolve Hand foot and mouth disease has nothing to do with footandmouth disease a

concerned about your height Your primary care doctor can refer you As for supplementing your workouts with hGH theres no evidence that it will improve your athletic performance and as far as making your muscles bigger not everyone responds and results vary widely Not only that but the risks of taking hGH without medical supervision are similar to steroid abuse severe facial and body acne gynecomastia you grow large breasts premature balding decreased highdensity lipoprotein the good fat increased lowdensity lipoprotein the fat that causes heart disease increased total cholesterol thrombolytic disorders dependency like an addict irritability aggressiveness kidney and liver dysfunction liver tumors testicular atrophy your testicles shrink decreased sperm count pain when urinating prostatitis impotence inability to get an erection sterility inability to have children and premature closure of bone growth plates which would stop your linear growth And furthermore It can be tough when youre not as tall as other kids Theres not a simple answer For some males its enough to work out perform their best train hard stay disciplined and eat healthy play sports and over time they learn that height isnt everything But at 19 you may not be there yet and its understandable An endocrinologist can determine if hGH treatment is indicated Hand foot and mouth disease HFM is a viral infection characterized by fever and a typical rash most frequently seen on the palms of the hands soles of the feet and inside the mouth It should not be confused with foot hoof and mouth disease that affects cattle sheep and swine Vaginal itching and burning can have several different causes Most common are yeast infections and bacterial infections Normal bacteria and yeast are both found in the vagina in a delicate balance Some things including antibiotics diabetes and pregnancy can upset the balance This allows the yeast cells to take over A yeast infection can result causing burning and itching There may also be a thick whitish discharge If you have any of these symptoms you should call your healthcare provider Here is a good article from WebMD on yeast infections httpwomenwebmdcomtcvaginalyeastinfectionstopicoverview Diabetic neuropathy is a common complication of diabetes It happens when there is nerve damage to the large and small nerve fibers in your body usually starting in the feet This is caused by high glucose or sugar in your blood over time One of the most common symptoms is burning but people often report pain or tingling as well The symptoms are often worse at night Because the sense of touch is decreased there is a risk of damage or ulcers on the feet that are often hard to heal The symptoms can get worse over time so it is important to see your doctor He or she can often make the diagnosis just by listening to your symptoms The doctor may also test to see how well you can feel light touch vibration and pinprick There is also a special test called an EMG or nerve conduction test that can measure how well the nerves are working Getting your blood sugar under control is the first step to treatment There are also some other very good treatments available to help decrease the pain and burning Click on this link to a WebMD article on diabetic neuropathy for some more information Yes Go back to your doctor to have your foot checked He or she will have to look at the foot to decide what is wrong Your foot has 26 bones There are 5 long straight bones called metatarsals beneath the top of the foot Each of these ends in bones called phalanges which are the toes Tendons that move the toes are attached to these bones Any bruising or swelling in the foot can affect the ability to move the toes by pressing on these tendons Bruising or bleeding can also spread throughout the foot and up into the toes Possibilities include a bad bruise sprain or a small fracture that did not show up on the first xray This is not unusual Your doctor will decide whether further xrays or other testing is needed I do not speak professionally on this topic but I have also been seeing doctor for a yr with plantar fasciitis followed by pain on top of foot In my case there is a subchondral cyst that caused fracture of 4th metatarsal which only showed up on MRI not x rays Stick with all follow ups until you determine the cause of pain  One symptom might be numbness in your feet I had this problem The pain was always worse when I first stepped on it in the morning I went to the Dr and they said I had plantar fasciitis Its inflammation of the heal Mine got so painful I could barely walk I got a night splint at CVS and wore it every night and whenever I was sitting I also took Ibuprofen and put ice on the heal I found that filling a soda bottle just over 23 of the way with water and freezing it then rolling my foot on the frozen bottle helped with the pain and swelling There are also stretches you can do to stretch your foot it helps to do it several times a day If this doesnt help you will need to see your doctor I did finally end up getting a cortisone shot in one of my feet Of course going to the doctor isnt a bad idea to begin with Good luck I to have plantar fasciitis I did get a night splint at CVS But some of the other things I have done are wear shoes at all times while your awake Use ibuprofen for inflammation Freeze a plastic soda bottle filled 23 with water and roll your foot on it Do stretches several times a day faithfully If you have some hightop shoes or hiking boots that you could tie fairly tight and wear at night that would be very helpful The idea is to not let your foot get into a relaxed posistion this causes your faciitis to shorten then when you step on it it stretches it causing it to become inflamed and be excruciatingly painful Good luck hope this helps I respectfully disagree with the previous poster first off an mri would be the easiest way to diagnosis a herniated disc Sometimes if its bad enough it will show up on a ct scan Secondly Xrays are kind of a false sense of security They are only able to tell if you have a fracture In some small instances it can show the spine being pulled due to muscle spasms or as the previous poster said curvature of the spine The only way an Xray can be helpful is if and only if you go back in 6 weeks and get another set done it can show if there were a hairline fracture by new bone growth  Like any broken bone it will grow back together in 6 weeks with extra bone present Going later for the second set of xrays the bone growth can beinterrupted as arthritis because the body will have bone growth after injury in a year to 16 months osteophytes to stabilize the spine Lastly if you havent been diagnosed I would defer going to a chiropractor If you are diagnosed with herniated discs they cant or should not do adjustments on you as they can cause paralysis if they crack the wrong way Be your health advocate I tried the surgery route you trade one pain for another Hi Sorry but its a very visual thing your best bet would be your doctor if you have one if not try the ER Good Luck Hi You have not said but if this is a deep cut then it is probably healing but because of the site being under your foot its a very slow process and may take a bit longer than you think But daily give it a nice sea

walking for your heart and body Do hope this helps you Good Luck Hi Well I can say your not alone if you google smell under your beasts you can find more info but here are some bits that may help but remember we are what we eat so could be something in there So there is Grapefruit seed extract mix a few drops in water and wash twice daily with it or you could try some cut lemon and wipe the area and let dry they say it should go in a couple of days Ok they say it could be a yeast fungus so your could try dabbing some boric acid powder on the area and you could also try this as well a 14 teaspoon in a litre of water shake well drink through the day this way you attacking it from both sides if works that way dont worry I take boric acid daily for Raynards disease and ED works for both

ankles Perhaps he should think of a strain free sport that keeps him pain free Good Luck Unless its for a very prolonged period of time then low likelihood Infrared lasers dont have a very high frequency so their radiation isnt dangerous theyre actually behind visible light on the electromagnetic spectrum It sounds like you are just above the healthy weight range your BMI is 29 and it should be between 1924 for a healthy range I would use this tool from WebMD to calculate your waist to height ratio too httpwwwwebmdcomdietcalcbmiplus I would focus on eating heart healthy foods and slowly increasing your activity level Start slow so you dont burn out too quickly and after some time you will be able to increase your workouts Dont stress about losing weight just set small attainable goals for yourself and over time you will see the weight come off Good luck I have had this problem for years Sometimes the pain is worse below ball of foot I have found that I can place a tennis ball on floor and take my foot and roll ball around I seems to help The ball of my foot just under my toes felt like I had been stung by a bee My doctor said it was related to the arthritis in my toes which weakens your joints My big toe began to turn toward my other toes causing a hammer toe I have a aircast on right night What you might like about it is that it is designed to take away the moisture or air everytime he puts preasure on it Also the hard plastic sides actually feels good around because of the air flow but yet secure Thats hard to believe but it is true for me I am still not walking I probably tore something But regardless this aircast did protect me and with only 2 straps it is easier for you to remove and put back on Also is designed to wear in a shoe I could not tackle that but as a mother of a young boy I believe this is the better choice That 5 day cast would make the transition harder for your child because it is so much heavier If your concerns is based on protection The aircast can do the job in my opinion NO WAY It is not worth the risk of giving yourself a bigger pain with that ankle What I now know is that when an ankle bruised All those muscles that were able to help you not get hurt before are strained and stretched and if it heals proberly then you might be able to continue same lifestyle AFTER it has mended If you make one simple bad move that might not seem difficult It could That is when you potentially always have a bad ankle Really just sit this one out This happened to me before I changed my sneakers When I ran or walked in those sneakers my toes would hurt especially the one next to my big toe The lack of toe space in my sneakers caused my toes to cram against the front of the footwear Causing pain and discomfort later and sometimes during the activity I now wear sneakers slightly larger than my actual sneaker size to prevent this Your toe was most likely being crammed when you sprinted it could be a ganglionic cyst or a hematoma as a holistic therapy not gonna guarantee anything but it couldnt hurt Your daughter is obese and needs a full assessment Her major weight gain occurred roughly at the time her endocrine system kicked in with her menstrual cycle I would ask her physician to look into two conditions Cushings Disease and Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome The evaluations are straightforward and both are amenable to effective therapies Clearly her thyroid function needs to be assessed as well If the family history is strong for obesity it is common for girls to express the obesity gene at time of pubescence Teens can sneak eat with the best of them so what you see her eat may not at all reflect what shes actually consuming If the home environment includes lots of junk food sitting around and people who are themselves not practicing healthy nutrition and exercise habits then shell emulate those habits Finally research shows that in teen girls physical activity plummets by the age of 14 or so They literally stop moving But they dont stop eating Thus the problem Please get the medical assessment done completely and as soon as possible See a rheumatologist for an arthritis evaluation you may have bone spurs There certainly might be You really dont state the neuropathy youre experiencing If its pain numbness tingling  neuropathy is a general term as given to a condition of the nerves so you really need to supply more information Until one has that information to assume anything would be wrong to state on this page The neck to finger tips may be a red flag for a nerve degeneration  but to be honest  this sounds like perhaps a circulatory situation Best to see your doctor and have a workup done Best of luck to you Dont know what a ankle fusion would do for Flatfeet or so called fallen arches An ankle infusion simply binds the bones of the ankle together hence the term fusion making the ankle joint a mass of bone You certainly need to consider a professional opinion from a podiatrist and an orthopedic surgeon This makes no sense to me and Im a retired radiological technician As for my opinion as to reversal  Id say with faith on past patients and my work  the answer is NO It cannot be reversed after the bone fusion has taken place without extended reconstruction of the ankle joint itself Good luck with your future endeavors Your symptoms are very charecteristic of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and what may also be called Trigger Finger My concern would be the other factors The cramping of your feet may indicate another issue which is best addressed by an MD You may be low in certain vitamins  have various malalignments of the cervical vertebrae  but I as well as an MD would certainly need more infoas to where the herniated disc iswas located My guess is that you sit for long periods behind a computer your posture is bad  and you get little exercise You should see your MD for blood work calcium levels and have a nuerological workup I suspect its carpal tunnel from a computer keyboard or other repetitive task Your MD can give you better indications as to what you need to do Yes my daughter got hand foot and mouth disease from her daughter that is 20 months old It is a nasty and terrible virus Your throat feels like razors blades are in it your body feels like you have pneumonia My granddaughter and daughter have suffered terrible with this virus and there seems to be nothing that helps Yes I have experienced a move from my right foot to my left It also led to significant numbness in the toes on left foot Gabapentin seems to handle the situation when sleeping can you still move the joint without having to help it with your armsif no seek professional help Is there any irregularities when you move it like grinding or severe sensations if yes seek professional help Is there minor swelling try to take a anti inflammatory and use cold compress on the knee elevate the leg above your heart especially when inactive for periods of time usually the swelling may cause a lack of circulation that may cause the tingling sensation like when your foot falls asleep Monitor the injury as if it seems to get worse always seek professional help Its always easier to treat then to repair an injury yes liver failure nerve pain such as a pinched nerve in the spine I had neuropathy pain in my left foot but I never took medication for it My A1cs had been 5360 for several years but the pain was still there In 2007 I started using an insulin pump My adjustments on my pump enabled me to be in the range 70130 almost 90 of the time That improvement resulted in greatly reducing my pain I have an occasional twinge of the neuropathy pain but it rarely bothers me now Many diabetics can reverse their neuropathy by improving their control Tetanus shots are statistically good for ten years although many clinicians will suggest a booster after five years Tetanus shots only prevent tetanus lockjawit does NOT prevent a wound infection so watch for any signs of infection It is really up to you to get a tetanus booster or not but theoreticallyl your vaccine is 2008 is still effective Based solely on your description this would not be typical of chicken pox varicella Search WebMD for some more information about this now uncommon viral infection While a child may get a mild rash about two weeks after a live vaccine like varicella it would not be typical just to get an eruption just on the toes The chicken pox lesion is a water blister on a red base often referred to as a dew drop on a rose petal If it is just on his toes I would be more prone to consider a contact dermatitis from his shoes or something he came in contact with while in bare feet Since I have no way of seeing it firsthand this is just a blind guess so please follow up with his health care provider if this rash does not resolve UnfortunatelyI cant see em Your description is really not sufficient for me to know what caused these bites assuming they are bites There are many things that appear to be bites and are not The itchy part may improve with using topical hydrocortisone Unfortunately without the ability to examine your foot I would have no idea if you will be able to play in your tournament a few days from now Medical providers do not like making blind decisions like this so you will need to be examined A tetanus vaccine prevents tetanus but does not prevent INFECTION Deeper wounds like you have described could become infected if not cared for properly Yes any skincovered body surface is susceptible to a fungus but be careful of making dermatological selfdiagnosesmany skin conditions can mimic the appearance of a fungus You can try overthecounter antifungal medications to see if it helps but consider having a medical exam if you are not improving in about a week Unfortunately it would not be possible for me or any medical provider for that matter to be able to offer you a diagnosis blindly over the Internet Not only do you need to be carefully examined but the doctor will need to take a thorough medical history and order some diagnostic lab tests It would not be possible or prudent to guess what may be causing pain all over your body so you will need to see a medical professional to start the diagnostic process Finding the cause or causes of hives is VERY clinically difficult There are no tests that would conclusively determine the specific cause You can due hundreds of tests and perhaps get a few things that show up positive but that does not prove this is the specific cause There are no tests for rare causes unfortunately Of course you and her mother are frustated Who wouldnt be Frustration does not make it any easier in finding a cause so the next best thing to do is just treat her for hives with something that worksand something that she can take every day It would not be prudent or even possible to determine if someone was experiencing a stroke blindly over the Internet Strokes are unilateral one sided and severe daily foot or leg cramping are not signs one would experience These symptoms could indicate vascular problems or even neurological disorders however so they deserve a complete evaluation by your medical provider Expect some diagnostic tests including blood tests  and perhaps a low back xray or Doppler imaging studies of your lower extremities if your medical provider feels these tests are necessary Never underestimate the wisdom of your bodies to give us warning signs so please do not ignore these symptoms It stops itching and crackingand normal skin returns I am sure you can find information on the Internet regarding air quality and the cities that are considered the cleanest Clearly breathing in automobile fumes is not good for any human especially newborns so consider smaller communitiesnot big cities Clean fresh pollutantfree air is always the best You are more likely to find this in the country and rural areas The redness may be inflammation but I dont have enough information about the type and location of your fracture nor do I have the ability to examine your foot The only person that can address this issue would be the medical professional who is currently treating you  someone who knows the details of your case and your medical history Your child cannot be adequately diagnosed without an examination A medical professional will need to see him firsthand a description is just not sufficient to make this important call There are literally hundreds of bumps that can occur on human skin I dont know your ageor more importantly have any way of seeing your toes and examining you but it may be onychomycosis  a nail fungus See a podiatrist or your primary care medical provider If anyone can help your painful feet a podiatrist can Someone who studies just feet for four years is clearly the expert After a careful examination and perhaps an xray a podiatrist will be able to make a proper diagnosis and treatment plan This can range from getting some custommade shoe inserts orthotics to antiinflammatory medications In some cases an xray may reveal changes in your feet that may be improved by a surgical procedure Either way the podiatrist is the right person to see for foot pain It is not likely that cigarette smoke in another apartment 50 feet away would have long term health consequences for you but if you are sensitive to that smoke smell you may have to move You need to see an orthopedist and have an MRI You have given your conservative treatment enough time so you need a higherlevel diagnostic evaluation Before talking about a cure or even an effective treatment you need to have a definitive diagnosis  not something that you may be doing accurately I assume you are not a podiatrist and not something that I can blindly determine based solely on your brief posting You need to be examined by an expert so I recommend that you see a podiatrist You may also need an xray of that painful foot In the meantime you may get some relief with antiinflammatory medications assuming you can take this sort of drug and a shoe insert to help relieve the pressure You dont get tinea PEDIS on your hands pedis means feet Tinea pedis or Athletes feet is a fungus and treated with an antifungal There are many good ones available over the counter It would be uncommon to have this on the hands so there are other forms of dermatitis that should be considered The diagnosis is the key so if you are diagnosing your child I would suggest that you see a medical provider to make sure before blindly treating a skin eruption They do NOT look alikebut a person can sure have both Eczema atopic dermatitis is a chronic itchy dry skin condition that really likes some of those spots that you mentioned Eczema can come and go over a lifetime A mainstay of treatment is moisturization reducing inflammation and controlling this itching using an antihistamine Poison oak dermatitis tends to form linear vesiculationsblisters that form a line of sorts It tends to ooze appearing on the mostexposed to the plant oils area first then to other areas that may have been touched by contaminated hands or objects After a shower and a change of clothes poison oak does not spread by this drainage nor can you spread it to others Poison oak dermatitis lasts a few weeks and is mosteffectively treated by oral and topical steroids Itching can be controlled by antihistamines You need to see an orthopedist or podiatrist for a higher level exam perhaps an MRI of you ankle to see the ligaments and soft tissue Xrays only show bone and based on the extent of your injuries there could easily be other problems that have not been detected As you know I have no way of examining the bottom of your feet over the Internet so I cannot offer you a diagnosis based on your vague description of sorelike things that look unpleasant The only way to get a definite answer  a diagnosis  is to see your primary care medical provider or podiatrist Nohe is not likely getting sexually aroused Little boys can have random erections all of the time ask the big boy in your life Children get pleasure from being snuggled so just snuggle him If it creeps you out if he is interested in the feet just say no One of my kids liked to play with other peoples earlobes when he was little Just redirect him or distract him away from those feet and I am he may give up this habit soon You are wise not to embarrass him so be tactful If he turns out to be an adult with a foot fetish someday not that uncommon he will most likely do it private and not bother anyone You will still love him anyway There is really little that I can do blindly over the Internet since I have no way of examining your skin eruption A visual exam is essential to make an accurate diagnosis Failure to improve on your current treatment may indicated that the diagnosis was incorrect or the treatment was not appropriate Your only course of action is to be examined again or see a dermatologist for a higherlevel diagnostic opinion Limp or crawl to a phone and have someone take you to a urgent care facility were you can be properly examined and perhaps have an xray to see if you have a fracture or just a serious sprain There are a lot of bones tendons ligaments and muscles in this area so if you are having pain and problems ambulating it makes sense to have a professional examine you You cannot be blindly diagnosed or treated over the Internet based on a brief vague description of the symptoms He can start with his primary care medical provider While an orthopedist or rheumatologist could be needed the primary care provider would be able to determine which one would be appropriate based on his or her examination and diagnostic blood tests It may not be arthritis at allif it is on the bottom of your feet it could be plantar fascitis See a podiatrist for a proper examination and treatment which could be as simple as getting different shoes to special orthotics shoe inserts Arthritis can also be improved by using NSAIDs a class of drugs that includes ibuprofen and naproxyn In the US using a deodorant is usually standard not so much in other countries It is one thing to smell nice it is another thing to smell offensive to others As a medical provider I have grown accustomed to all extremes of human odors I am not a big fan of any human that is overlyperfumed I would prefer BO over someone that smells like an overpowering rose garden Some offices ban excessive perfume since some people may be chemicallysensitive or allergic Whatever you choose keep it subtle Deodorants can be scentfree and a tiny amount of perfume can be pleasant Since you message is two hours old now WebMD Answers is not an emergency response service I suspect the bleeding has stopped by now In most cases these avulsiontype cuts will bleed quite freely but steady pressurecompression on the wound without peeking for at least ten minutes or so should suffice Compression and time will allow these tiny severed blood vessels to close Once the bleeding has stopped you can inspect your wound to see if suturing is requiried If so you have have an 8 hour or so window to have this done If the flap of skin has been completely severed and the wound is small it should heal and new skin will cover the area If the flap is hanging on and is pink means it has a viable blood supply allow this piece to cover the wound and it may regraft Obviously without seeing it it is difficult to offer you patientspecific advice I am very sorry but determining a solution to your concerns would not be possible over the Internet Clearly you are concerned so my suggestion for you is to see a psychologistcounselorsomeone with a special interest in sex therapyto properly assess and help you A guess Yes I suspect you have an infection such as cellulitis or a paronychia that needs immediate attention In most cases it will be bacterial and you will need an oral antibiotic Get to an urgent care facility today or call your regular medical provider some may just call in a prescription for you The blisters could indicate a bullous condition such as impetigo Lesscommon would be a herpetic condition You dont need a guessyou need a definitive diagnosis and treatment One possibility for sudden excruciating foot pain usually the big toe is the most painful would be  Assuming you are not having muscle cramps a spider bite or an injury this possibility would be high on my list You would need to see your medical provider right away so that you can have a simple lab test If your medical provider feels that you do have gout this can be promptly treated and you can get some immediate relief Noyour numbness is caused by something else so please consult your medical provider I have no way of determining if your arm is broke over the Internet since I dont know the details of the injury location severity or have the ability to examine you Only an xray can give you that answer Other causes to consider that may account for your symptoms would be nerve compression from the contusion sustained during the incident Again you will need to see your medical provider to have a definitive answer  not something that can be done in this forum There are no supersolutions my friend Your height and weight is more likely to be genetically determined blame it on your parents so it not likely you will ever get taller than you are now By age 18 the growth plates have closed Gaining weight is another issue and even this may be difficult for you to circumvent nature Eating a wellbalanced diet with sufficient calories is really the best you can dothe rest is up to your metabolism When you are 50 or 60 you may laugh about the time you wanted to gain more This article should address your question httpwwwbtcdcgovdisasterstrenchfootasp Not even close Hand foot and mouth disease is totally different than rubella German Measles You are most likely vaccinated and immune to rubella but there is no vaccine for HFM disease Your systolic blood pressure is too high especially your systolic pressure Keep taking your bood pressure and writing it down but it would be advisable for you to see a medical provider for a consultation See a urologist I would not trust a kidney diagnosis to a Chinese herbalist who looks at your feet There are many diagnostic tests to check your kidneys assuming a specialist sees any evidence of a kidney problem Sickle cell trait should not cause your ED or ejaculation problems and I have never heard of a kidney disorder that would be cause those issues Again see a specialist No but carrots and sweet potatoes can do it carotene There are four step required for your answer 1 You must first have a medical history I do not know anything about you or even the reason you were hospitalized 2 You must have a medical examination of your swollen feet  there can be many different causes 3 You need a diagnosis and a treatment plan 4 Finally if all of these steps are done you may get that cure you are seeking Unfortunately you are asking for something that cannot be provided over the Internet so you will need to consult your medical provider A medical provider would have to see and examine these skin areas of concern to tell you if there is a connection or commonality A vague description is really not sufficient Athletes feet is caused by a fungus and yes you can also get a fungus on your scalp or penis Again I have no idea if there is a connection or if all three areas are caused by a fungal skin infection Nothose patches that go on your feet to pull out the toxins are worthless Try a different antifungal creamthere are many highlyeffective ones over the counter Your pharmacist can help you choose one While there are home remedies out there none are really that effective The ones that seem to get better may have simply spontaneously improved on their own and people attribute the cure to the last thing they tried I am a fan of scientificallyproven treatments Yes sperm can definitely remain viable in the vagina nurtured by the cervical mucous for two days or even longer If you are trying to become pregnant unprotected sex is the best way to achieve this goal I have no idea if you are pregnant so if you are having signs and symptoms suggesting that you are please take a home pregnancy test andor see your medical provider No it will not work or help the cold symptoms It will just make his feet smell like Vicks Dont tell your mother or grandmother that I told you this but Vicks on the feet is absolutely worthless There is no direct connection between a fractured clavicle collar bone and swollen feet assuming you did not sustain an injury to your ankles or feet at the same time as the clavicle incident It would be best to consult your medical provider  someone who knows you and your medical history  and someone who has the ability to examine you to address our swollen feet The most common complication of a burn a second degree burn based on your description would be a secondary skin infection A burn that is now red angry and painful may be infected The only way for you to be sure is to see a medical professional and be examineda description is just too vague to make a decision like that blindly That would not be very likely If this person had lethal or serious doses of radiation he would not be sitting next to youhe would be very ill Corns dont usually itch but feet can certainly itch If you are having a painful itchy area under your little toe then think fungus Fungus just loves the warm moist environment inside your shoes Tinea pedis Athletes Foot is very common so you may want to consider a trial of an antifungal medication perhaps mixed with a little bit of hydrocortisone creamointment for the itching Your pharmacist can help you select one of the many brands on the market Another possibility would be a contact dermatitis perhaps from a new shoe or even from a change in laundry detergent or dryer softener If your home treatment doesnt help there are plenty of podiatrists out there to lend a professional hand or foot By having the ankle xrayed and properly examined by a medical professionalthis is really the ONLY way Without the ability to see his little foot firsthand I really couldnt comment if this will delay his walking but my blind guess would be NO Babies have a remarkable ability to circumvent these minor anomalies He will most likely be running through your house in about five months or so Make sure to specifically ask his pediatrician about this or ask to be referred to a pediatric orthopedist for a consultation At age nine he should be seen by a pediatric orthopedic surgeon Many reasonsmoisture accumulation atopic dermatitis tinea pedis Athletes foot chemical reactions to shoes or detergents left in your socks bare feet etc In order to get a patientspecific answer you will need to see a medical provider so that your feet can be properly examined and you can be definitively diagnosedtreated I tried to address your question my friend and posted a response I would need to review your medical records and look at your growth chart and take a medical history to even guess if your were done growing I am not sure why you are worried or concerned about it since there is really nothing you can do to change your genetic code If the pediatrician predicted 63 then that may be accurate Shoe size is not relevant Here is some basic information to start including some wonderful reference sites httpwwwwebmdcombrainpostpoliosyndrome Every person with PPS is different so there risks would also be unique to them You are having various connective tissue problems like a torn rotator cuff but as you know this can happen to people who do not have PPS myself included When having surgery it would be good for your doctor to be familiar with PPS or you may have to educate him I dont knowI would need to look at your medical records and growth chart to see if you have leveled off in height Typically once the growth plates have closedwhether they are in your knees or feet your growth will stop You will always have big feet but remember you are nearly six feet tallthey will keep you from tipping over While it is still very possible for you to grow even taller and still need bigger shoes most of your growth tends tends to slow down and then stop in your teen years No callouses and corns do not necessarily hurt more after a shower If you are not sure what you have on the bottom of your foot it would be best to see a podiatrist foot specialist for a proper examination and treatment Not without having the ability to see and examine this bumpyour description is just too vague to make a guess as to what it might be Yes its safe to soak your feet in Epsom salts but I am not sure this will really help your swollen feet Please talk to your OBGYN about this issue since swollen feet during pregnancy is something that may need to be addressed medically Make sure you are elevating your feet as much as you can good excuse for taking it easy this last monthyou are going get quite busy soon and closely watch your salt intake Some special compression socks may be helpful Any patientspecific treatment instructions should be done by the medical provider who is caring for you but if you do not need the pain relief from Vicodin now you can switch to ibuprofen at any time if your doctor is okay with it The Vicodin will not be bioeffective after six hours or so so anytime after that That is inexcusable As difficult as it may be to find a new doctor that is more thorough and responsible I think you should look around for an INTERNIST Internists are usually very current with diabetes management and with patients who have multiple health problems I am not sure why you are on longterm prednisone but this can have an association with your blood sugar You need to see a good foot specialista podiatrist Not only will they determine the reason for your foot pain they will also suggest shoes or shoe inserts so that you will be able to walk painfree The big concern would be a secondary infection You can call the medical provider that surgically removed your nail or see another medical provider If the ER is your only option this would be an acceptable next step See a podiatrist Yes a new xray is in order or perhaps even a more detail imaging like an MRI Before worrying about surgery or other treatments you must first have a diagnosis  Sounds like cellulitis See your doctor immediately You should probably go to your primary care physician to get a blood test for pregnancy Slip  Fall The big question whose stairs did you fall down Thank goodness no broken bones Pictures I hope and call the doctor need more of something when is the follow up and do the follow up Watch out with the drugs stuff not necessary If it hurts get what you need and why did you fall Sounds like those meds arent a good fit for you I tried Prozac and all it did was make me lethargic Did pretty well on Effexor but not sufficient Im now on a generic form of Welbutrin daily and 10 mg Lexipro at bedtime Ive been on them for quite some time and am doing very well I have osteoarthritis and some other physical problems and want to assure you that frequent or constant pain coupled with stress can make anyone depressed My faith also helps me Hope Ive helped Do you know how thin your blood is I am NOT very knowledgeable in BP but if you are standing and sitting logically because blood is affected by gravity if you are on too much HBP meds thins blood your body might have an issue keeping it out of your legs which would also explain why sleeping helps it but again not my area of knowledge just an opinion Soma or Carisoprodol is a generic drug and is used for the treatment of muscle pain and muscle injury It is used by the person who is suffering from muscle sprain and pain You can from chemist shop or online at TopDrugMart dot com Loose skin around the knees may be part of the natural aging process Extreme weight loss may lead to excess skin These issues may be addressed by a plastic surgeon Excess sun exposure is the No 1 cause of premature aging and wrinkling of the skin If you suffer from chronic swelling around your knees compression garments and support hose may be beneficial Eyes are typically the first place that my patients complain of wrinkles The muscles around the eyes contract frequently and secondarily wrinkle the skin covering it Make sure that youre not overlooking simple solutions to stop contracting your eye muscle such as getting the proper prescription on your eyeglasses or contacts Are you squinting Are you smoking and frequently squinting as a result In addition to decreasing excessive muscle contraction you should add vitamins A C and E to your eye

avoid the sun between the peak hours 11 am and 2 pm UVA and UVB penetration are strongest during the early afternoon Use a sunblock with an SPF of at least 40 And wear a wide brim hat while outdoors

bone There arent too many options with a herniated disc but a great chiropractor is my first option for me personally They can help ease the pain lessen the stress and if they are good enough they can fix the problem Yes There are so many types of scars and most do move over time You said it was on the arch of your foot Scars Atrophic scars These scars are sunken down into the skin This type of scarring is often seen with acne scars or with wounds where skin or muscle is removed by an injury This type of scarring can also happen when the body produces so much scar tissue in one area that it prevents new cells from growing where the wound took place Hypertrophic scars These are usually red or purple and are slightly raised above the skin They tend to fade and get flat over time Contracture scars These types of scars often happen with burns and end up pulling the skin in towards the site of the injury This can make the skin look puckered around the wound Keloid scars These are very elevated red or dark scars that form when the body produces a lot of extra collagen in a scar Keloid scars are actually a benign type of tumor and often grow bigger than the area of the original injury Stretch marks Also called striae these are considered a unique type of scar since they dont happen in response to an injury but because of the skin being stretched rapidly often during pregnancy or adolescence The tissue here is often sunken a little into the skin and tends to fade with time So you may fit inton one of these catagories but do not worry If you tend to feel pain

said since my ankle was in the position to fix it for so long that my ankle had changed to repair and that it will take about a week or so to get straightend out and to be able to do normal I thought well gee you could have told me that when I got it removed or before I paid for more xrays you dont know how fustraited I was anyways it still hurts but its getting there and they said to do ankle flexers thats where you flex your ankleto me it hurts just as bad so then also to start adding more weight and to swing it back and forth with 510lb ankle weights hope your ankle gets better and feels

arthritis in your joint Id see my doctor if it didnt clear up after a reasonable amount of time You could also have something called Cellulitus which left untreated can be fatal it is a form of staph and requires some atibiotics  if there is redness swelling and it feels like the skin has a fever then you should go see a doctor Vertigo maybe mine is usually caused by wax pressing on my ear drum except the 1st time which was from a middle ear infection Look into an antifungal cream from a drug store If you did not bruise your foot then you dont have a bruise I had this on my back and found that it was a fungal rash that I had been treating It was that ever lurking athletes foot your lifestyle maybe the reason i mean the diet planshort sleepingeating lees veggies and all that kind of stuff No HAVE YOU CHECKED YOUR IRON LEVELS THIS CAN BE A CAUSE OF COLD EXTREMITIES ESPECIALLY DURING EXERCISE SIMPLE BLOOD TEST SHOULD LET YOU KNOW IF YOU NEED AN IRON SUPPLEMENT MOST PEOPLE DO If you are really concerned have an xray of it However it is not uncommon to have bruising in the foot just above the toe and under it since it is shorter You probably do have a fracture or at leased jammed Tape it to the toe next to it for a few weeks 46 if you are not going to the Dr for an xray It is to late to apply ice to it That would have helped with the bruising Keep it elevated when you are not on it That will help keep the swelling down You didnt mention if his foot was swollen And or has any red lines in the area It could be as simple thing as gout Which is very painful And common for his age He would need further test to find the root of the problem You failed to mention if you have seen a doctor about this problem Coupled with you cannot lose weight without lowering your intake Eat more saladsfruitsand veggys Stay away from pastas ice creams pies cakes etcetc And you can do exercises in your chair Leg lifts barbells Every little bit helps you burn calories But if you continue to take in more than you burn up You will continue to gain weight I weigh 230 lbs and 5 12 in high Almost if not in the same boat you are in You have to choose to do it Consider what your weight brings with it High Blood Pressure Diabetes heart trouble etcetc Your pain in your backknees and hip are more than likely due to being Obeseaka over weight Loose weight loose the pain You should see your Dr also as you may be diabetic or pre diabetic Get a CBC blood test and see where you stand I did and founs out I was diabetic elevated blood pressure etcetc It scared me enough to loose weight Like me you are a walking time bomb Well it is good there is no fracture Very little swelling or bruising However if the muscles are torn Or some ligament damage it may take longer than 78 weeks Wear an ace bandage on it while you are playing for a couple more weeks Yes you can have gout without swelling However gout usually will have some red lines in the area And is very painful If it continues see your Dr As there is medication you can start on for gout Like Allopurinol I would not exercise right away And if you have not had an xray of it to make sure there is no fracture Keep it elevated until the swelling goes down It may take weeks for the bruises to go away If you exercise on it now The swelling may get worse Suggest you get an xray of it to be sure there is no fracture first If it is a hairline fracture it usually only takes 68 weeks to heal But can take longer If you have been walking on it And or have any swelling still in your foot Keep it elevated  And stay off it for 2 more weeks If you still are having problems You may want to follow up with another xray so they can compare it with your first xray to see if it is healing ok Diabetic Neuropathy comes along with being diabetic Diabetes is a progressive disease And with your sugar levels being high Your neuropathy will continue And may even get worse People with this problem are usually put on a medication like Gabapentin This usually gives you some relief  However does not cure it Try to loose some weight Coupled with some exercising may help And one of the best exercising things you can do is walking That can help you with your neuropathy and weight I am not saying you are in fact over weight a lot of diabetics are Including myself And I have found that walking is the best thing for my side effects like neuroapthy from being diabetic Start slow 12 block and after a few days increase it to a whole block I have to push myself to walk So when I go shopping I park farther out in the parking lot Do my shopping and return to my car Every little bit helps When it is hot I go to an inside mall and window shop You dont have to buy anything just walk around in air conditioning There are several Diabetic Support groups on line also Some with the same problems you are having Where you can share different ideas about diabetic problems Sounds like you have diabetic neuropathy in your feet Ask your Dr if he done a blood test with A1c in it That would tell you how your sugar has been running for the last 3 months And certainly loosing weight will help Your BMI has a lot to do with your diabetes and Triglycerides I am not familiar with the Paleo diet Never heard of it However the Mediteranian diet has helped a lot of people with weight and diabetes There are two main things to focus on when wanting vibrant glowing skin I would recommend seeing a podiatrist if you havent already seen one Maybe special insoles made specifically for you could help My husband had insoles made for him It takes a while for your feet to adjust but will help if recommended for you Possibly a plantar wart They are tender and painful Check with your doctor well it could be ticks  talk to your doctor about it I happened to be in the same boat as you except I now know for sure I have to have fusion in my wrist which will dramatically reduce my wrists range of motion I fractured my wrist twice First time very badly in 1981 and the second time only about 2 years ago Although it was set correctly yet the second time it broke very easily because it had become suseptive to breakage due to the first severe fracture It only took one year for my wrist to develope ARTHRITIS to the extend that the only solution now is FUSION withTitanium I have very soft bones and my body is arthitis proned and any trauma to my bones especially to areas that bones connect to CATLIDGE soon develope Arthritis In your case I think for one your fracture must have been relatively severe and in an area where jointcartlidge has an imprtant and pehaps mulirange function and two it could have not been set very correctly and or your joints like mine are proned to Arthritis due trauma Physical therapy is very important after the bone heals Age certainly has someting to do with it in other words the younger one is the better and quicker the bone and cartlidge heal and thus the likelihood of development of Arthritis is less What triggers Arthritis is when cartlidges between two connecting bones ware off due to either age or trauma usually when the connecting bone to the cartlidge is repositioned off its normal or natural position which can occur with bone fracture or even after it set Do get second and third openion from expert surgeons Good luck This could possibly be a circulation problem Other conditions that can cause cold extremities are thyroid issues Hypothyroidism or Diabetes I hope this helps It could possibly be Athletes foot I had it before and it burned itched and it would come and go I hope this helps Charley horses at night could be caused by a low potassium level Eating a banana before bed helped me I hope this helps you Have you tried altering ice and heat I fell and turned my ankle in under me I spent 8 weeks on crutches with a knot on top of my foot The Doctor told me I had pulled the tendons in the top of my foot He said for me to do the ice and heat Tylenol and Ibuprofen and continue to walk on it but to walk then elevate walk and elevate I have this problem also all the time for years now and take Furosemide and Hydrochlorothiazide for this but I am also having to really lower my intake of sodium and get a lot more exercise Too much salt and not getting enough exercise WILL cause swelling and numbness and tingly sensation in feet ankles legs face hands and fingers Also a pinched nerve in the neck andor lower back will cause this as well I cannot sleep on my back without waking up with my face eyes hands and fingers swollen numb and tingling and this is because I have had 3 herniated disks in my neck and even with epidural shots in the disks to take the swelling off the nerves the pressure of sleeping on my back causes the disks to press against the nerves which will cause all the swelling and numbness The major thing though is the salt intake amount and lack of exercise When I cut out the salt and move around more by cleaning house gardening mowing the lawn get on my exercise bike and work at the restaurant and try not to stay on my back at night when sleeping the swelling and fluid retention is reduced tremendously Also drinking at least 10 16 ounce glasses of water everyday is a big help towards this My prescription water pills which are also BP meds plus all that drinking of water everyday usually will knock out all that swelling and numbness I hope this helps you because I know how uncomfortable and miserable all this swelling makes you feel If they are really tiny almost piimplelike thats mullescum which is contagious But if they are larger I dont know the answer  Had this happen to me did the fussion 3 times and they all failed I am type 2 Diabetic so that could have something to do with it Get second opinions you could end up like me disabled for the rest of my life thank you for reply cocoanoah he has done A1c and all he says its elevated and my tryglcerides are up He says I only pre diabetic but it sure feels like I am full blown He has sent me to a neurologist to find out why the neuropathy I had a nerve conduction test done and it shows I have the neuropathy I could have told him that wants to give medicine for pain The neurologist wants give me something for pain it is not pain perse but if it is not going to make the reason of tneuropathy go away I dont want to take it There is no reason to I asked if metforman could be prescribed  his answer it works for people wth diabetes but tests have not proven it will will for pre The only true way to find out if you are pregnant is to see you physician for blood work and if further studies are in question as possible Ultra sound to detect a pregnancy out side of the uterus One last little bit children can be conceived while you are on your period I have seen a few I dont know about your hands and feet but have your doctors checked your tonsils and adenoids If you still have them they might be causing your sore throat I had a similar problem last year My doctors thought I had strep and put me on antibiotics and then put me on allergy medication but when I went to a ear nose and throat specialist they said that my tonsils themselves were the problem and they had to remove them Sometimes general practitioners may not catch a problem like that so it may be necessary to go see a specialist who can more accurately diagnose your problem Internist sounds like a infections I am in no way a medical professional merely another peripheral neuropathy PN sufferer However if it were me I would discontinue your diet return to a more balanced moderate meal plan and see if your symptoms disappear It could well be that this unnatural diet is somehow causing these symptoms I suspect that your symptoms have nothing to do with a vitamin deficiency Good luck it would probably be pointless to go to a doctor They normally wont do anything even if you broke your toe because there is no way to cast it best to tape it up with regular medical tape Yes I have had friends over the past few years that have actually had fractures in their hands and feet and were still able to run and do every day tasks They didnt even know they had been hurt Its still going on it wont going away Can anything please give me an idea of what it might be Its so annoying it could be from your socks or shoes try getting diabetic socks or shoes or just the regular shoes that are wide with i mean i am not a doctor but i have heard if other people doing that It sounds similar to some sensations I get from FibromylagiaIf the sensation is like a burn and it makes it hard to move your muscles sometimes I would do some research on other fibromylagia symptoms and see if it matches up Good luck there are sweets out there that he can eat that taste like real sweets I eat these sweets cause I have type2 diabetics never go barefoot check your feet everyday to make sure you have no sores on themif you find any contact your doctor yes I have a condition called dyshidrotic eczema and your symptoms sound very similar Although mine mainly appear on my hands the red spots and blisters can appear on both hands and feet The affected area can be very itchy before the blisters appear but generally not while they are present Google dyshidrotic eczema images and see if any of the pictures look similar to what you are experiencing I believe there are tests than can be done to determine whether dishydrotic eczema is present so if I were you I would make an appointment with your doctor to look into it if they are dry and scaly it could be eczema I may turn the salt shaker one time only once in a while but mostly I do not use salt the only salt I keep is sea salt Good sea salt that dissolves instantly We use too much salt I am not a doctor but I have been studying nutrition as my major and it was a weird concept at first but it actually has many benefits This process has been shown to boost metabolism and help your bodily functions by promoting the storing of energy I have been doing this for three months and kept to a strict regimen of exercising and eating using a 21 day split of eating then eating light as well with exercise and not exercising and I actually have gained 10 pounds only muscle and lost 5 body fat I highly recommend against doing 19 hours of fasting and 5 of nonfasting as everyone needs energy which comes through food especially if you are exercising as it can be hazardous to your health Note that on my fasting days I was still keeping my calories going but not nearly as high to replenish those lost from exercise On those days I typically would eat bananas broccoli peas carrots greek yogurt etc stick to fruits and vegetables besides one meal and a protein shake On my two days of eating I often would stick to rice fish quinoa chicken pasta and oatmeal getting about 45 meals a day to store energy for my fasting day Yet again I am not a doctor as he would have to evaluate you to see if this diet is appropriate but it definitely is one of the better diets that exists A friend of mine had these symptoms and was diagnosed with diabetes  low blood pressure Aquatic therepy would help you no joint stress You can build up muscle in water the tingling idk about but the coldness in hands and feet can be normal  for years now my feet are always cold even if i have socks on it cold that could be Sciatic Nerve being pinched somewhere in the lower lumbar or sacrum area love problem solution astrologer 9829717996 go to walmart get the LAVA brand soap for a dollar It has pumice particles in it Pumice is the stones that people rub on their feet to take off dead skin cells and such I accidentally tyedyed my feet yesterday and the lava soap got it right out of my skin depending on you age if your up there in years and getting stiff that will happen as long as once you get going its not so rough happens to me all the time do I need to go to the emergency room should I go to the emergency room I beilieve you have a sprain or tear that you need to stop the activity and give it a chance to heal completly If not it will never heal you keep aggrivating it as long as you are getting the basic calories that is needed to maintain the body it should be fine but if you are burning off more than what you consume than you should experience weight loss even though you may lose weight you need to eat sufficiently for the body recover after exercising during rest Cramp happen when you use muscle that you are not used to or when fatigued are you properly resting stretching and putting coldslight pressure to let it heal Concussion and head trauma are used interchangeably Usually in sports concussion is described when someone is knocked out and doesnt have relocation of what happened Regardless they are both trauma to the head and have same symptom You need rest and monitor any changes that has happened how are your leg muscle do you have somewhat strong calve muscle if not work that muscle out and it should help your shin as well simple calves raises on stair standing on your heal and to of the stair go up and down by extending foot and heel below the stair level to give that extra stretch also may be take otc anti flammatory medicine If its the ankle ice with elevating the feet is the treatment Also you should support the ankle by wrapping it with bandage or immobilize it with ankle wrapsupport if you need to move around If its the arch stop putting pressure on it and let it heal Have you talked to a doctor at all It could be a small fracture If it were a sprain the pain would have been much worse at the beginning Is it swollen at all Take Tylanol for the pain and if there is any swelling it should help with that as well RICE is a great aid for this type of injury but if the pain keeps up you may need an xray or an MRI I had the same symptoms It started on my hand and went to my feet After going to various doctors I was diagnosed with a rare fungal infection that can be transferred from dogs to humans in rare cases I cant find anything about it on WebMD or from any of my current drs Ive started to call  ask vets since after my diagnosis the local vet diagnosed the family dog with the skin infection the tx for mas was a high dose of ingested Lamisil 9pill form which can be bad for your liver as well httpwwwhypedccom is the best store to buy Birkenstock shoes You may observe it for a while If it is itching it can be a sign that it is already undergoing the healing process so you may just have to leave it alone Remember to keep it clean though Always take good care of your skin You most likely sprained your ankle or stretched a tendon I have done the same thing a few times I usually wrap my ankle in an ace bandage and prop my foot up and take an antiinflammatory medication to help with swelling If your foot dosnt get better you should see a doctor Resveratrol is the best natural antiaging agent which helps you to gain back glowing and youthful skin It is basically a natural phenol molecule people often call it a miracle molecule it posses the properties to fight against the cancer obesity and aging skin you can know more and buy the resveratrol products from here I suggest reaching out to my doctor on the phone or to the urgent care center of your doctor to ask if there is something wrong There could be some allergic reactions and it is better to get professional help to make sure that things are good Hope your 2 year old gets better I think you have arthritis problem Emily You do not have to discard them but I would recommend that you bleach them all in the inside and maybe even take the sole out and bleach it as well I have had a staff infection on my inner thigh before and my mother would always bleach my shower after every one I took Did you have pins They can work themselves out Or it could be scar tissue not much but surgery can fix the scar tissue Or it could be something not related to the foot surgery Is it the same type of pain you had before surgery It could be a bone spur Buy gel shoe inserts to pad the foot area No This is usually caused by high blood sugar Have your blood tested Or it can be caused by drinking alcohol or toxic chemicals In any case you need to have blood work sounds like it may be have circulation issues definitely shin splints or small fractures in the bone they are hard to get rid of but see ortho norma gerena Could be a pinched nerve or bad disc in lower back You say there has been no indication of poor circulation but I am curious what are those indicators Has a doctor told you this Have they done a ultrasound to check the circulation If so I would have an orthopedic doc check you out to see if this is back related By chance are you a diabetic This can cause leg and foot issues I think you should definitely see a doctor and I recommend you go to an Urgent Care or an Immediate Care facility the one that has an Xray machine on site Before you go I advise you to feel the effected area of your foot find the spot where it hurts the most then point your toes up  this may hurt but you want to find out whats wrong so you can really feel where the bones are and see if your most painful spot is on one of those bones If it is you could very likely have a hairline fracture a crack in the bone Im not a doctor but I have associated with people who had a hairline fracture and had to be put on crutches because if left untreated its likely to become a full fracture I hope you get it checked out as soon as possible and get well soon Yes you should go see a doctor You should go see one who has an Xray machine on site quicker diagnosis It may just be a sprain but you also couldve gotten a crack in the bone called a Hairline Fracture Youll never know whats really wrong an how much longer the healing process will take if you dont get it checked out Ive had experience with sprains especially one on my left knee I couldnt straighten my leg for a few weeks and was on crutches but I still many times walked in a limp and drag sort of way If you cant walk at all you should get it looked at to see if you may have cracked the bone soak your foot in epison salt and hot waterhot enough that you wont burn yourself 3 times a day the red spots are probably small broken blood vessels when your not soaking rub mineral ice and wrap in ace bandage you should be good to go in week or so and you should take some ibuprofen 2x a day as wellif no improvement go to doctor you probably have circulation problems could a red blister type spot on toe have anything to do with diaetes well its possible you will always have some level of pain due to this new work but i would say drink a lot of water as water helps keeps the joints lubracated and when ur off work try some heat if you have pain and try your best to take it easy  which i know can be hard at work vitamins will also help the better care you take of all ur body the better a chance you have to make this better  also try to stay off it when ur not at work  im sorry your going through this  its not easy  i hope this helps if u start to have bad pain speak to you doctor for possible things you can do  feel better I suffer from leg pain and leg cramps The pain level is 9plus My pain is every day most before bed time Sounds like edema Lots of homepathic things can be done for this First lower the amount sodium in your diet Also if you dont alreadyhave them try compression stockings or socks You can find mild to moderate ones at you local department store Standing for long periods of time can cause the swelling to increase so try to limit the time you are on your feet When you are sitting elevate your legs Its a great excuse to sit in you recliner If the swelling continues gets painful or you notice any sores on your legs or feet see your doctor Just try it It worked for my kids Rub on feet and put on socks and within a 1020 minutes the cough will lessen Also marshamallow root is good for cough  chest congestion It sells in extract form Try an electric Massager on the bottom of your foot and slowly up your calf works for me You could have had a latent viral infection of the Facial nerve nucleus such as by the varicella zoster virus that could have then been activated either by the trauma of the surgery or any medications given afterwards There is no connection whatsoever between the Plantar Nerves and the Facial Nerve 1st  most important thing would be to rule out blood clot or atherosclerosis since you have had angioplasty in the past I would recommend going to a chiropractor I had a similar problem about a year ago and went to my chiropractor He took an Xray and found that my lower disc had not formed properly I lift weights and over the years it had taken its toll The disc had slipped causing extreme pain in my lower back that would shift on occasion from left to right He treated me for a couple weeks and realigned the disc No cure for me other than surgery so I have just cut back on lifting heavy and changed some of my exercises I am actually having surgery for this in the morning Its called functional hallux limitus They are going to remove the bone spur shave down the round bone under the big toe and replace the bone that connects the toe to the foot I will be in a cast with no weight barring on that foot for 8 weeks could it be radiculopathy My left foot aches along small toe side and in joints above toes Hurts when I press on spot in middle half way between toes and archmetatarsal Hurts to walk normally Less painful if I keep foot flat Is a bit swollen Was on an airplane with athleticwalking shoes for about 6 hours Was swollen at bedtime Hurt a bit to walk next day Today hurts more Have been

the fluid that my body does not release on its own You can cut down on your salt intake as well as talk to your doctor The swelling in your legs could also be an early sign of Congestive Heart Failure CHF Ibuprofen will help with the pain as well as the inflammation I hope this has helped answer your question this is called edema and can be cause by many things i suggest u look up what can cause

likely bruised some tendons Internal bruising can take several months to heal Keep off your feet as much as possible elevation is good too You said you were walking around afterwards this means nothing is broken Internal bruising can take up to several months to heal It sounds like the bruise made its way to the surface hence the swelling This is good Keep doing what youre doing and give it

time but no surgery at the present time my hands and feet are cold 90 of the time they also get red when its hot and purple when its cold I have been told it is because I have a weak heart It is

Make sure your doctors are aware of your medical history and all medications I am not an expert in this matter but it sounds like you may have diabetes Arthritis might play a role in it as well but I

circulation not stretching enough or dehydration Make sure that you are well hydrated because when you become dehydrated your limbs can start to feel cold and numb Also stretching your calf is very important Just take a few extra minutes to stretch it like this Go to a wall and press the toes and balls of your feet against the wall while the end part of your heel remains on the ground Push your body toward the wall and you should feel the stretch on your calf If none of this helps it could be a circulation problem so you should see a doctor I had the same thing happening and the stretching and hydrating made it go away Sounds like it could be bad circulation or low iron If an iron supplement doesnt help it could be the other Go to the emergency room You could be having something called compartment syndrome This may have been caused by too many different things to mention The most important thing is to maintain circulation in the leg which could be compromised according to your
