{"text": "If you have had surgery near your penis I would say yes Your testicle probably had a negative reaction to something From my perspective its nothing serious but I would recommended that you visit your local doctor and get it looked at I have slight pain in left testicle kind of comes and goes You need to see a doctor immediately It sounds like you have a serious condition not sure what it could be but you should definitely be looked at as soon as possible First I HATE CANCER My daughter has it and I am a nurse so I know what she is going thru Is your brother a small person or a large person I only ask because I would think that if the testicles are not hurting too much he may just could wear a larger size of some really soft boxerbriefs they would feel soft on the skin and yet give some gentle support without feeling so constricted Right now if he was here I could fashion him something that would be comfy but not knowing it is hard for me to say If you have a mom or a grandma maybe fashion some sort of sling that would have some soft wide elastic at the top and then the fabric attached to the front and the back going under the scrotum holding them softly up a little so they dont hang and hurt him when he is up and walking or even just sitting in a chair I can see it in my mind so clear I know it would work Use some sheep skin material for the supporter that would attach to the wider elastic band that would go around him and thru his legs and connect to the back Then all he would have to do is just step into it and pull it up GOSH I hope someone in your family can sew this would be so great for him I hope this helped this brave guy some Blessings and be well I was adopted by my father Unfortunately its impossible to say what this might be

not necessarily uncommon the fact its occurring 5 days postoperatively and seems to be linked to some sort of painful activity means the swelling may not be normal in your case You dont say if you

than usual If a testis twists around the spermatic cord has to twist around too as it is fixed higher up If this happens the blood flow to the testis is blocked in the twisted spermatic cord This is

the UKs NHS The medical term for having one or two undescended testicles is unilateral or bilateral cryptorchidism How undescended testicles are treated In most cases the testicles will move down into the scrotum naturally during the first three to six months of the babys life If the testicles do not descend by this time treatment is usually recommended This is because boys with undescended testicles may have fertility problems in later life and an increased risk of developing testicular cancer  although this risk is still very small If treatment is recommended this will usually involve an operation called an orchidopexy to move the testicles into the correct position inside the scrotum This is a relatively straightforward operation with a good success rate Surgery is usually carried out before your child is two years old If the condition is treated at an early age the boys fertility should be unaffected In a small number of cases it may be possible to use artificial hormones to stimulate the descent of the testicles But the only thing is that your now 55 Been trying to find anything that will help you lots of medical stuff but not for a 55 year old man most of it is aimed at young boys Have you thought of going an seeing a URO for help and information and to see what can be done for you Do hope this helps in some way Good Luck Hi This is what could happen it your testis move to much from being to lax In some people the tissues that surround the testis in the scrotum are lax Therefore the testes can move around in the scrotum more than usual If a testis twists around

you need Worth a try Found you this piece of info Any other situation that raises the temperature of a mans testis for a long period of time might affect his sperm count and cause infertility Wearing tight or heavy clothing that insulates the scrotal area can raise scrotal temperature by 1 or 2 degrees Fahrenheit which could lower sperm count over time although this has not been proven conclusively in research studies Taking long hot baths or using a sauna might also raise testicular temperature after about 10 minutes of exposure to heat which could also lower sperm output if this happens regularly A study published in October 2012 in Spermatogenesis suggests obesity and a large belly might cause increased testicular temperature and contribute to decreased sperm counts and infertility This possibility is somewhat controversial and needs confirmation in additional carefully controlled studies Good Luck Hi See Above Answer Hi and ouch as long as its not a deep cut use

is gone Compress your thigh using an elastic bandage or tape Take antiinflammatory painkillers  Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs  NSAIDs  like Advil Aleve or Motrin  will help with pain and

high that he needs treatment says Eugene R Shippen MD author of The Testosterone Syndrome I am 52 year old and I had my trt two years ago I use to spread the interval of the dosage and make sure I follow application direction exactly If 1900 is nanograms per deciliter then it is 3 times higher then normal httpwwwmedicinenetcomscriptmainartasparticlekey51013 However if you are not feeling more aggressive or feeling of doing things you normally would not do I would not be concern about it much While in trt you can also monitor other indicators to make sure your levels are healthyhttptestosteronewisdomblogspotcom201110monitoringtestosteronereplacementhtml Orchitis would be higher on the list than a testicular cancer but both need to be considered You need a testicular ultrasound Doppler as soon as you can get it and of course a visit to a urologist Testicular cancer does not really act like this It is not very helpful to worry unnecessarily about these things until you get a diagnosis I am sorry that I cannot be more specific but making these blind guesses is not something that medical professionals are fond of doing We like to see these problems firsthand look at the imaging studies and THEN and only then make a presumptive diagnosis Hang in there my friend no pun intended You did the right thingyou saw a urologist for a proper examination Yes prostatitis can cause some but not all of your symptoms so please finish that course of antibiotics A person can have more than one issue going on at the same time so please keep in mind that burning on urination as well as irritated or sensitive penis tip can be a chemical sensitivity new deterrgent or dryer softener or a condition called balanitis Have you tried a topical overthecounter steroid cream Make sure to always use a condom so you will not have to worry about a sexuallytransmitted disease next time I am glad that your chlamydia and gonorrhea tests were negative but you may not be so lucky next time Blackheads comedones can occur on any skin surface Since the penis and scrotum are covered with skin you can certainly get them in this location Prostatitis can certainly cause those symptoms especially if your doctor examined your prostate and determined that you did indeed have this disease Please stay on your Cipro but make a follow up appointment with your urologist at the end of the course just in case Herpes tends to rear its ugly head shortly after the onset of symptoms so without the characteristic tiny painful blisters that are typical of this disease the chance that you have herpes is not very high With that said it is not normal to continue to have persistent pain at the tip of your penis so something is wrongYou may have to have some additional diagnostic tests Herpes would not be high on a diagnostic list based on what you have described While it would be impossible to blindly offer you a definitive answer without examining you more likely possibilities would include chaffing like you mentioned or a fungal skin infection tinea cruris also known as jock itch  a common skin condition that occurs in warm dark moist skin areas You would need to see a medical provider if this condition persists or worsens This is really the only way to be properly diagnosed and treated If you want an exact answer then you will need to be examined by a medical professional Based on the information you have shared there is a very good chance that you do have a perirectal abscess or a pilonidal abscess Either of these two painful conditions require immediate medical attention Do not delay You most definitely need to have your back evaluated Because of nerve pathways certain lumbar back problems can cause pain to be referred to your groin I suspect you will need an MRI to fully evaluate your back I cant offer you a definitive answer since I have no way of examining you over the Internet but this could be a small spermatocele  unrelated to your varicocele I would suggest that you see your medical provider so that you can be properly examined and diagnosed If you do have a lump on the testicle itself this will need to be confirmed See a urologist You are having symptoms suggestive of prostatitis an infection or inflammation in the prostate gland I am not sure if there is a relationship with your boweldiarrhea and fatigue issues so this could easily be an entirely separate medical problem A shower would be better followed by a change of underwear boxers instead of briefs and perhaps some talcum or corn starch in the groin to help absorb the sweating Rubbing alcohol is not harmful but it can be pretty cold If he had any open wounds or rashes in his groin you would likely see him dance around a bit it burns A Staph infection in the testicle area is painful in itself let alone have an abscess surgically lanced I have done this procedure on a number of patients and as careful as I am to limit discomfort there is still pain involved Just using lidocaine in this area is painful to inject and often very difficult to even use Many abscesses have just a thin layer of skin over them In order to numb this area the lidocaine has to be injected IN the skin not underneath in the pocket of pus This can be very difficult Sometimes just a quick puncture using a sterile scalpel is LESS PAINFUL that trying to numb up this challenging area Hopefully you are on the proper antibiotic and treatment regime and better by now If the Staph infection was caused by shaving you may want to consider going back to au natural again Well they have to find it It shouldnt be difficult to locate if it is still there and not atrophied An ultrasound should be able to easily locate a migratory testicle that decided to retreat back up the inguinal canal again for some crazy reason If it is there it may need to be surgically anchored back into the scrotum where is supposed to live for the rest of its life A testicle left in the abdominal cavity will not likely form sperm so your sons fertility will be reduced Children get very anxious during testicular exams and have very strong Cremisteric reflexes will temporarily pull a nervous testicle out of the scrotum and up into the abdomen so consider having Dad check it again when he is more relaxed at home Having him sit crosslegged may help pull it down or having him sit in a hot bathtub for a while may encourage this testicle to go South again It can sometimes be felt in the groin if you know where the inguinal canal is but this is more in the realm of the medical provider So start the hunt at home but see a pediatric urologist if you can find it There can be many reasons but it would not be possible for me or any medical provider to be able to specifically determine that cause you YOUR testicle pain blindly over the Internet You will need to see your primary care medical provider or a urologist This is called a cremesteric reflex It is not something you can control I dont really understand your question First the testicles do not store or make semen The testicles make sperm and the sperm is stored in the epididymis The prostate gland makes the semen Second abstinence from ejaculation does not increase sensitivity in the penis so I am not sure what you are asking I think you mean UNdescended testicles ones that are not in the scrotum where they belong but rather in the abdomen At age four bringing them down now is advisable It would be highly highly unlikely that future fertility would be adversely impacted since you are doing surgery at this age I think you will end up with plenty of grandchildren An ultrasound is only as accurate at the technician doing the exam so yes things can be missed A cystic mass spermatocele should be able to be seen but if the spermatocele is calcified and no longer filled with nonviable sperm it could be easily missed Spermatoceles are usually no big deal if you are not having symptoms but if you are concerned see a urologist for a higherlevel evaluation If you are still in pain you will need to see a medical provider so you can be properly examined You did not provide sufficient information for me to comment and obviously I have no way of examining your injured testicle over the Internet You will need to get examined by a medical provider Testicular pain can be caused by many thingsorchitis an infection of the testicle itself or epididymitis an infection or inflammation of the sperm collecting tube There are other causes of course The ONLY way for you to have this twoweek old issue properly assessed is for you to see a medical provider for a careful examination As much as you may be avoiding this exam your testicles  both of them  are important and deserve an examination If this is a testiclar torsion you need to go to the ERnow A torsion is a medical emergency Unfortunately I have no way to reach out and examine you and order a doppler ultrasound to make the diagnosis You would need to address that question to the Creatorbut ovaries are internal organs because they are very fragile and form eggs monthly that are seeking fertilization Fertilization of course also takes place internally as wellyou cant really have babies growing on the outside of the tummy can we Testicles are on the outside because spermatogenesis requires a cooler environment If the testicles were on the inside sperm would not be viable That is a very simplistic answer so I hope that addresses your question Sounds like a takehome school question to me I dont know your ageor the content of that online prohormone that you were taking I also do not know anything about your medical history in order to make a patientspecific comment If you have to wait four months to see a medical provider get the wheels in motionjust in case Unfortunately I would have no idea when you will return to normalthe state before you took thse supplements He needs to SEE a medical provider This important step is really the ONLY way that he can be properly examined diagnosed and treated  three things that cannot be accomplished online Extreme discomfort is a highlymotivating symptoms so perhaps he can now be convinced to do the right thing and not make excuses Having his girlfriend post a question online is not a substitute for proper medical care I cant answer that question since I would need to know what it actually was I cannot make a blind guess and determine if it will go away I am very sorry There are MANY things that cause intrascotal masses A brief description of the size and location does not really substitute for a thorough examination I realize that money may be tight and that you do not have insurance but there are really no alternatives You will need to make a decision based on how concerned you are about this new finding Give your husband the same consideration as your automobile If your car was causing problems or making a strange noise you would get it checked out before it became worse Many things epididymitis orchitis kidney stones testicular cancer Dont try and solve this problem yourself based on Internet information See a UROLOGIST and have a thorough examination Testicular pain is not something a man should ignore Obviously I have no way of examining you or seeing this moist itchy spot firsthand please dont post a photo but it may be tinea cruris also known a jock itch a yeastfungal skin infection Fungus loves warm dark moist areas and guess what This is one of them To be professionally diagnosed you would need to see your medical provider but if you want to try some overthecounter antifungal medications your pharmacist can help choose one for you to see if it helps you may be able to skip and expensive medical visit If this area gets worse or painful or has signs of a bacterial infection pus oozing tender swelling then you will need to get medical care immediately Nosperm containing male and female chromosomes are made in EACH testicle so you still have a 50 chance of having a boy or girl unless you adopt a child I could not possibly answer that question I dont even know the type of warts your doctor has diagnosed Are they condylomata And there is really no way for me to know how or when or who gave them to your husband I think your boyfriend definitely needs to have his testicles and scrotum evaluated by a urologist The lack of ejaculation is concerning Asymmetrical testicles could be normal but in light of his other symptoms it would be good to know if he has a large spermatocele varicocele or even a hernia Your other testicle is likely fine so there is a very good chance that you are capable of fathering a child The only way to prove fertility is to have a sperm count however The undescended testicle really should be removed or relocated back in your scrotum where it belongs See a urologist and get this fixed This should have been done a long time ago Talking about treatment is very premature You need to first be medically evaluated and diagnosed to determine if there is a problem and if so what would be the cause It would not be possible to blindly do this over the Internet without any medical history I dont even know your age so seeing a urologist would be an appropriate step Yes you will have a normal puberty and you are most likely producing sperm Since you are not planning on having a family right now it may not be that critical that you have that information but if you wantget a semen sample and look under the microscope or you can ask your doctor to order a semen analysis You are probably worrying unnecessarily I would bet you are just fine There is often some free bleeding during an abdominal procedure and this free blood can migrate South through the inguinal canal directly to your scrotum This could be one reason for the discoloration The swollen penis defies and easy explanation since I cant examine you and I hope that you will not try to post a picture I dont believe it is really to the catheter use There are some strange things that happen in the OR after you fall asleep so I hope that you were not accidentally traumatized by someone leaning their elbow on your junk to rest As a novice student in the operating room I once leaned my arm for an extended period on his thigh The next day when I made round to ask about his abdominal incision he said it was fine but his thigh was killing him When I was 22 I was under general anesthesia to get my wisdom teeth extracted I ended up with a huge bruise from my buttocks to my thigh I suspect I accidentally fell off of their operating table but no one said a word The mystery still haunts me During your postop visit you need to show the condition of your genitals to your surgeon for a patientspecific explanation I dont know the type of surgery you had My guess is that time will return your genitals to their normal appearance soon It may be a while before you can proudly pose nude for a magazine I hope that your surgery went well and you are now on the road to recovery Just give it a rest my friend It is not likely that you cause testicular damage from overlymasturbating but you can cause enough trauma to have discomfort If your symptoms persist you will need to see your medical provider but I suspect a few days of rest and recuperation will give our overworked boys time to completely recover No the amount of the ejaculate is determined by the prostate gland There is really no way to specifically and accurately address this question without an examination so I would strongly suggest that you see a urologist or the surgeon that performed your surgery There can be many types of intrascrotal masseshernias hydroceles varicoceles spermatoceles cysts or even tumors Properly identifying your sack of fluid is essential either by examination ultrasound or both If your little grandson is on the chubby side the penis can be hidden by a surrounding fat pad quite common in children If you push on the fatty area around his penis and the penis seems to emerge like turtle coming out of a shell then it is probably just fine There is a medical condition called a hidden penis and another relativelyrare condition called a micropenis that you read about on an Internet search but it may be too early to know if he has any of these unlikely conditions Bringing it up to the pediatrician at his upcoming oneyear examination would be appropriate If you have an inguinal hernia get it fixed There is no reason to take the risk of having an incarcerated hernia An inguinal hernia in spite of its close proximity to your penis and testicles will NOT reduce or change your fertility I cannot diagnose you blindly over the Internet so I would strongly suggest that you inform your parents immediately of your findings and concerns You need to see a medical provider for a proper examination You have no risk nowthe only risk for developing a testicular cancer would be in the testicle that was removed when you were 16 Your other testicle is quite important now so please do a routine testicular selfexam when you take a shower Any lumps should be brought to the attention of your medical provider Your remaining testicle is not at any increased risk because of your past historyno more than the rest of men of your age No your medications that you listed are not the cause You do need to see your medical provider about this issue however so you can have an examination and a few diagnostic tests You are not likely losing testosterone at 45 Based on what you have shared I see nothing troublesome about your recent sexual escapades Satisfied but weakenednothing wrong with that Keep it up so to speak Every man would benefit from a full physical examination at least every few years Have some diagnotic blood and urine tests get your prostate examined and even have a testosterone level if you would like I am not sure why your testicles are hot when your urinate not common but this should be mentioned to your medical provider I dont have enough details about your case to comment but testicles that do not descend by age 68 years old can be very problematic I would suggest that you see your medical provider or a urologist for a careful examination and some diagnostic tests to determine what is going on in your case You could have a spermatocele and accumulation of sperm in the epididymis These may come and go Lesscommon would be epididymitis but this should be painful Next time the lump appears make sure to have it examined while it is still there Any discharge from the penis should be considered suspicious and be properly evaluated If this cloudy discharge only occurs during a bowel movement or straining constipation then one possible cause could be prostatitis  a prostate gland infection or problem You need to see your primary care medical provider or a urologist to be properly diagnosed and treated I have no way of determining what you have based solely on your brief description I do not know anything about you your age your medical history etc In order to be properly diagnosed you will need to see a medical provider  someone who can take a more detailed medical history and more importantlysomeone who can examine you Your testicles are too important to rely on a blind guess via the Internet Obviously there is no cure for a missing testicle The low sperm count can not be increased but a fertility specialist can collect and spin down several ejaculates if you are planning a pregnancy Your accumulated sperm can then be inserted in your female partner as an artificial insemination Nearly all varicoceles are on the left side and yes they may seem to pull your testicles higher up on that side but typically the weight of a varicocele is more likely to pull it downward  Right now you have a selfdiagnosis and may be correct but it is a good idea to have a medical provider examine you Intrascrotal masses can be confusing if you are not experienced in sorting them out OMG why have you not gone to a doctor The male organ can be maniputled so easily It is extremely important that you seek a physican as soon as possible The male organ has many functions besides sex One must pee Please go and see a doctor as soon as possible Just because it is outside the body doesnt mean it has only one function Please I beg you go to a doctor and be honest about what is going on Discomfort with what Groin or Hip different things You might want to go to a different doctor and get a different blood test Be honest with the doctor about all activities If you want to find out what is going on you must be honest Doctors are not gods they need information Have the doctor check for everything including STD Hep C HIV Aids and any and all blood disorders including any biologicalbactial disorders Might be something simple The hip thing might be something all together different Hips with males one thing groin another think about it Theres the testicle itself which should be like a firm but not hard eggsized almost thing The epididymis where the sperms mature and develop the ability to fertilize the egg feels more like an earthworm attached to the bag And there can be little tiny cysts and nodules that come off of that and lumps and bumps So its essential that when you do a testicular selfexam that you get used to understanding what youre like Its like women with a breast selfexam you learn the lumps and bumps The guy down there needs to know whats normal so if there is a change they can say aha this lump wasnt there last month Men are supposed to do testicular selfexams They should be doing an exam ideally once a month best in the shower when theyre soapy and wet and that will tell them what their normal baseline is But our biggest problem in urology is that men are diagnosed with testicular cancers late They dont find them early when its a little lump or bump they wait until its large I would expect some inflammation and swelling but this sounds more than I have seen I would give it some time as he suggests wear an athletic supporter 247 for a few weeks outside underwear to keep it snug  gravity is not your friend here Also ask your urologist about taking antiinflammation meds such as Celebrex or overthecounter but highdose ibuprofen or Aleve Maybe even ice up twice a day Stay in close contact with him The best thing would be to seek a urologist They can run tests to determine what is going on That is a high protein count and my first thought is infection especially since I have chronic infections But see a specialist not only for a second opinion but because they know much more about urinary and testicular problems Go to your doctor and ask himher for laboratory tests and an ultrasound test of your testicles It sounds like a hernia My dad had one a while ago Get this checked out I am sexually active but married for 14 years so std are negative Youre into some kinky stuff I dont know a lot about testicular pain  but I found an article that might be helpful Sounds like if its been going on for 2 years off and on you might want to get it checked out httpwwwemedicinehealthcomtesticularpainpage2emhtmtesticularpaincauses i really hope this helps Oh sweetie please dont think the worst It could be an assortment of things including cysts or noncancerous tumors  even an infected ingrown hair But the only way to know for sure is go to a doctor If it is that small no matter what it is it may not be a problem as it would be simple to remove Just dont let it grow before doing anything about it well it seems pretty normal just if the pain gets really sharp see a doctor It is called Retractile Testicles Retractile testicles are very common and it merely means that although your testicles hang normally in your scrotum most of the time they are pulled up by certain muscles into the groin area in certain circumstances Testicles normally and naturally retract during sex especially prior to ejaculation I do not know about the pain in your left testicle since it has been there 7 years you may wan to consult your doctor Not masturbating did not cause this pain though sounds like hydrocele go to the dr and ask them about it it could be herniyah i would go back to the er  dont wait for the doctor appt cause swelling is a bad problem he could have a knotted vien wrapped around his testicals which if left untreated can cause it to be cut out its common for dotors in the er to dismiss thing s not cause they dont care but at level of importnce being someone who got shot would have priority over ur son but if is getting worse n hes in pain go back to the er  tell them u have an appointment but ur sons in bad pain n cant wait  hope hes okay  n i hoped this helped Its how the body is made For testicles to produce sperm and keep them alive they need to stay at a certain temperature which is a bit lower than your regular temp hence the sack hanging lower to get rid of some of your body heat When you are cold the sack rises to bring it closer to your body to get the heat from your body When you are hot the sack lowers to cool off and be farther away from your body heat This is kind of vauge butI know the feeling Are you overweight This area needs air If youre sitting around on the couch day after day theres no air getting to those parts They sweat Only other possibility I can think of is contact dermatitis as in are you allergic to detergentsofteners If not get some air down there If youre allergic to said laundry stuffs change them Im allergic to GAIN My daughter is allergic to Tide and My soninlaw is allergic to Purex Its pretty common And dont be using body washes They contain fragrances Also if youre allergic to detergentssofteners youll probably itch in your underarms Geez what the heck are you kids doing Ok besides the testicular torsion dx Id consider the more chronic problems of varicocele  a varicose vein in the the scrotum and a hydrocele Theyre not that uncommon These body parts are kinda special and I wouldnt be tying twine around them Historically there is not that great of blood circulation in the scrotum Thats why chemo is not so great in getting down to that place BTW anything that has to do with the scro you need to quit it Just saying I got checked by my doctor who informed me of this situation He suggested I get surgery I was hoping for an alternative not necessary consult doctor immediately "}
