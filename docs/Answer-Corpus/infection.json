{"text": "Please read my post before responding As stated in my post I have been to the doctor In fact I have been to two doctors I was referred to a urologist but the urologist is not available until the end of January The two doctors I have seen do not think it is anything to be concerned about however I am still bleeding rather heavily I am hoping someone will be able to give me some advice about what the possible causes might be or what I should ask to be checked for when I see my doctor again Absolutely Your body is trying to fight off a virus or bacterial infection and it takes a lot of energy to wage that war Youll feel exhausted for a week to two weeks after your cold symptoms subside Any longer than that and you should see a doctor Whenever you take several medications it is important to check with your doctor and pharmacist about drug interactions You are wise to question the combination of bupropion Wellbutrin escitalopram Lexapro and fluconazole Diflucan Bupropion increases your risk of seizures and the addition of escitalopram Lexapro raises that risk further This is especially worrisome for the elderly and for those who are at risk for seizures for example from a head injury Presumably the doctor who prescribed both of these medications felt that the benefit of this combination outweighed the risk Sometimes your doctor will need to check your blood levels of escitalopram when bupropion and escitalopram are used together Adding a single dose of fluconazole a fungal medication taken by mouth probably wont have a significant effect on how you feel However when fluconazole is used for several days it can raise the blood levels of escitalopram increasing your risk of complications There are several web sites that allow you to check drug interactions online but the safest path is to check with your doctor When you are seeing several doctors who are prescribing medications there is a risk that drug interactions between medications will be overlooked To safeguard against this happening it is always best to have one doctor a family practitioner or internist overseeing all your care Checking with your pharmacist before filling medications is also important Heres what I suggest Four infections in peak cold and flu season winterOctober through April Three infections in nonpeak season summer Three months of persistent residual fluid behind the eardrum Three backtoback courses of antibiotics for the same ear infection If your child fits into one of these categories ask your childs doctor about a specialist referral In inpatient health care settings the one most common is staph staphylococcus bacteria resistance Staph causes bloodstream infections in patients with catheters Sometimes the infection might be due to a catheter In that case the catheter could be removed or an abscess could be drained In some instances theres nothing to do to help the patients body fight the infection and that could lead to death We dont encounter it with regularity but the concern is these stories are becoming more common It IS possible to have both at the same time but if you think you go ta yeast infestion from sex is it possible that you may have an STD rather than a yeast infection If the OTC meds dont take care of the problem in the number of days you are supposed to use it Id definitely get checked for an STD Hello Dr I think I need to give you a little more information 9 days ago I went to the ER at 3AM because of pain in my ear They said I had a middle ear infection and prescribed me Augmentin That didnt work so well so I went to my doctor yesterday morning and she gave me the injection and said that I had a middle and inner ear infection She called the eardrops into the pharmacy in case the injection didnt work She also gave me a nasal spray NASACORT and Zyrtec I am just wondering how long I should wait for this injection to work before I go grab these drops  Inguinal lymph nodes are located bilaterally in the area of the groin The presence of lymph nodes throughout the body is a normal anatomical feature for both men and women The physiological function of inguinal lymph nodes is to filter lymphatic material that channels to the groin areas the feet the legs and the genitals During periods of infection the lymph nodes can be overburdened doing the work of cleaning the body of debris and become enlarged usually the lymph nodes are about the size of an eraser head Due to the location of an enlarged inguinal lymph node I knew someone with one the size of a golf ball the swelling can be uncomfortable reddened and sometimes painful Due to the body attempting to fightoff an infection the patient may have a fever and not feel well Yes any bodily infection including jock itch and yeast infections can cause the lymph nodes to enlarge somewhat But there are other possible causes including a cyst may be benign infections of the legs feet and groin areas sexually transmitted diseases cancer rarely and allergic reactions If the lymph node has not returned to its normal eraser head size within the 7 day period following the start of antibiotic treatment I would suggest that you follow back with the doctor for further evaluation Sometimes a 2nd round of antibiotics is needed or a different antibiotic may be required Occasionally the lymph node is biopsied to ruleout cancer andor to determine the best antibiotic to treat the enlarged lymph node I hope that this answer has been helpful and that you feel better soon Fevers are common in young babies and can usually be easily resolved with proper medical diagnosis of their cause and appropriate treatment is administered Although you do not want to panic over a slight fever these febrile babies need to be observed closely The situation can go from only having a small spike in body temperature to bad to worse very quickly This is due in part to their small body size immature immune system and the potential to loss body fluids It would be helpful to know the age of your baby the range of body temperature readings that youve obtained whether the baby is accepting fluids and other nutrition and how long that the baby has had the fever It sounds like your child is fighting off some type of viral or bacterial infection Fevers that last longer than 24 hours in young children without going down or are higher than 1004 degrees rectally in an infant  than 3 months old should be evaluated by a medical professional immediatelyTeething alone should not cause a temperature to reach the 1004 degree level Perhaps the yeast infection is not responding to the ointment and a systemic antibiotic is needed Or maybe another more serious infection exists When in doubt as is the case with your child always notify your doctor of a fever in a baby that is not responding to treatment I would call your pediatrician without delay and inform that individual of the babys condition If that is not possible a visit to your local hospitals emergency room is justified The message here is It is better safe than sorry when dealing with a sick baby I hope that your baby gets well soon I suffered from this condition off and on for years Then it went away I stopped eating breads white starches and added sugar Look it up It works I have lost 48 lbs in the process as well Every time I want a pizza I think about what it used to be like before I stopped eating bread I dont eat pizza anymore and have a fantastic time Here is the complete list of side effects caused on taking Cephalexin 250mg  httpwwwmayocliniccomhealthdruginformationDR603067DSECTIONsideeffects where its been stated that Muscle ache is a rare side effect on taking this medication For your any dental problem plz click here  confidentdentalcare  For your any dental problem click here  confidentdentalcare For your any dental problem click here  confidentdentalcare Could be I strongly advise you to go to your Doctor Yes a baby can have an ear infection without a fever Signs that might indicate an ear infection can include increased fussiness ear pulling not wanting to be placed in a horizontal position and drainage from the ear Most commonly these symptoms can be seen toward the end of a head cold It is always great to check in with your doctor office when you have a concern  a traige nurse can often help you decide if you should come in to be checked out If you are still having symptoms and are truly concerned go back to your doctor and ask himher to get an HIV RNA PCR test  this test actually tests for the presence of the virus in the blood itself not the protein antibodies that the regular HIV test does It is extremely rare that someone HIV negative on the antibody test after 3 months tests positive after 6ask them to check for acute HIV with the PCR blood test If that is negative consider the matter closed Also depending on what study you look at there are many people who contract HIV who actually dont report any kind of acute flulike illness at all Hence the importance of yearly screening if you are sexually active Usually a bad urinary tract infection will get worse and the symptoms will force you to go see a doctor or nurse practitioner Symptoms of an infection include low back pain fever difficulty andor burning when urinating or just not feeling well You may also see some blood in your urine Urinary tract infections are very common in women  Has your diet or sex play changed recently See your doctor if this continues for a few months It depends on how recently you had the piercing done So if its within the first week or so chances are the skin might grow back together although you will still have a scar at the site If its longer than that chances are you will always have at least a potential space there However if there is an infection it does need to be evaluated by a doctor and treated and the piercing may need to be removed until the infection has cleared at least  There are lots of things you can do every day to help your body fight these infections or stop them from getting started Basic hygiene works Washing hands before and after going to the bathroom will help as will washing your genital area with mild soap each day Women should always wipe from front to back after voiding and especially after a bowel movement to avoid spreading bacteria from the rectum to the vagina and urethra Drinking enough fluids 6 eightonce glasses each day and drinking some cranberry juice every day can prevent bacteria from multiplying and causing problems Empty your bladder soon after you feel the urge to go and go at least 4 or 5 times a day You can make sure your bladder is empty by using your hand to press lightly on the area over your bladder Avoid wearing tight pants and noncotton underwear Dont use perfumed soaps bubble bath talcum powder or colored toilet paper Know the symptoms of a urinary tract infection and call your doctor or nurse if you start to have any of these symptoms Increased urinary urgency or frequency Urinating small amounts Sudden unwanted urine leakage Feeling that your bladder is not completely empty after voiding Any pain or unusual sensation when you void Badsmelling urine Fever or chills See blood in your urine or the color of your urine is pink or red As you may know Desonide is a topical steroid It may appear to help the infection but it actually suppresses the bodys ability to fight the infection and will make it worse Even lowstrength topical steroids can make a yeast infection or any infection worse In fact topical steroid use can make yeast infections more likely As long as the cut is cared for you mentioned that it was covered you are very unlikely to spread the infection to your friends baby or anyone else Im sorry youre dealing with this It sounds very uncomfortable Any time symptoms are getting worse instead of better I believe its a good idea to get medical attention Go back to your doctor and let him or her know the situation is going downhill It also would be helpful if you used an oral thermometer to take your temperature a couple of times a day not when you first wake up If youre running a fever this is valuable information to report to your doctor Many things can cause the symptoms youre describing from appendicitis to an ovarian cyst to a piece of hard stool thats temporarily stuck in the bowel Only another physical examination and perhaps some additional testing can help lead to a diagnosis Best wishes to you Im sorry to hear youre experiencing these symptoms Unfortunately its not possible to selfdiagnose a  bladder infection or kidney infection Diagnosis can only be accomplished with a physical exam and lab testing of your urine While your symptoms certainly could indicate a UTI they also could stem from other causes Since there are no home remedies for UTI or any other urinary infections you should go to your primary care doctor for an exam If you do have an infection you will be given antibiotics to clear it up Note If you have a fever measured with a thermometer not by feeling hot or by putting a hand to the forehead you should head to urgent care A fever is the classic sign of an infection somewhere in the body Wishing you well Im sorry to hear youre experiencing these symptoms Unfortunately its not possible to selfdiagnose a  bladder infection or kidney infection Diagnosis can only be accomplished with a physical exam and some lab testing of your urine While your symptoms certainly could indicate a UTI they also could stem from other causes Since there are no home remedies for UTI or any other urinary infections you should go to your primary care doctor for an exam If you do have an infection you will be given antibiotics to clear it up Note If you have a fever measured with a thermometer not by feeling hot or by putting a hand to the forehead you should head to urgent care A fever is the classic sign of an infection somewhere in the body Wishing you well Im sorry youre going through this Id advise you see your OBGYN about this Several conditions can cause the symptoms youre describing and your doctor will need to take a sample of the discharge in order to correctly diagnose the problem Once your doctor has a diagnosis then he or she can discuss safe treatment options with you I would not advise treating this yourself using an overthecounter product Youre wise to realize everything about taking medication changes when youre pregnant Best wishes on your pregnancy First of all if youre thinking about selfmedicating dont do it Have you been diagnosed with a bladder infection or did you selfdiagnose this If a medical professional diagnosed you with a bladder infection then he or she would have given you a prescription for the appropriate antibiotic to treat that infection As you seem to be aware different antibiotics are effective for different types of infections An antibiotic that treats a tooth abscess for example may have no effect on a foot ulcer that got infected When a person decides to selfdiagnose and selfmedicate they do themselves a grave disservice In taking a leftover antibiotic for a perceived infection they may delay getting the correct diagnosis and treatment This can allow the infection to get worse spread and cause other complications If you believe you have a urinary tract infection much more likely than a bladder infection I suggest you go to a clinic or urgent care center They will take a simple urine sample and tell you right away if your problem requires an antibiotic Many conditions can cause symptoms similar to a UTI or bladder infection Even if youd had a UTI before do not assume you know thats whats causing your symptoms Only a urinalysis can tell you for sure if there are bacteria in your urinary tract Wishing you well I suppose its possible can be very painful and Im sure it might feel as if the pain is radiating down the neck to the shoulder However the pain youre describing could be caused by many other conditions including muscle strain  or even possibly  The only way to tell whats causing your pain is for you to get an examination by a medical professional If your pain doesnt clear up or if its accompanied by a fever Id suggest you contact your primary health care provider for an appointment to find out whats going on Hope this helps I suggest you return to your health care provider for a recheck You could be experiencing a new illness thats unrelated to the sinus infection Or perhaps it wasnt a sinus infection after all but a virus that has now gone down into your lungs Regardless if youre having trouble breathing its worth getting checked out Hope this helps Aw Im sorry your baby is going through this Uncomfortable is right Im not sure why you believe this diaper rash has turned to a yeast infection but I bow to your wisdom as the parent smile I dont have a lot to offer but I can tell you that regular old cornstarch available at the grocery store near the flour can help dry out the rash and its safe even for baby girls with all those delicate skin folds In fact since it doesnt contain perfume its a good choice for diaper rash in little girls If its possible to dry out your babys bottom by leaving the diaper off altogether for periods of time thats helpful too Whatever you do please do not use any overthecounter OTC yeast infection medications on your baby She may be uncomfortable but shell survive until you get a diagnosis from a health care professional I hope this helps a little bit Yeast infections can also come with discolored discharge and a foul odor Bacterial infections can also cause this Talk to your OBGYN they can take a urine culture and do an exam to make sure it isnt anything more serious than the mentioned above They will give you antibiotics for yeast or bacterial infections You dont have to have intercourse to get either They can both be caused by many things For examle scented body washes scented tampons wiping back to front and many other things Hope this helps Allergies and sinusitis can sometimes cause swollen lymph nodes in the neck but these usually go away fairly quickly If you have noticed persistent swollen lymph nodes under the arm it would be best to have them examined by your doctor An ear infection is usually limited to the ear You may have a runny nose  nasal congestion with it but it should go away within 10 days If it is viral antibiotics are not needed if it is bacterial antibiotics will help Since you have additional symptoms and it has been going on for 2 weeks it is important you see a doctor Flushing and chest tightness is not a part of an ear infection so see your doctor so she can examine you to find out why this is happening I would be likely to think it is the antibiotics Do you usually get a rash from running a temperature I think you should contact your doctor immediately before you take any more medicine Just my opinion Respiratory syncytial virus RSV is \t\t highly contagious meaning it spreads easily from person to person There are \t\t two main types of RSV and many subtypes strains For this reason you cannot \t\t have full \t\t immunity to the virus and you may have many RSV \t\t infections throughout life People with RSV infection may spread \t\t the virus through their secretions saliva or mucus when they cough  sneeze \t\t or talk You can catch the virus by Touching an object or surface contaminated with the virus and \t\t\t then touching your nose eyes  or mouth without first washing your hands The \t\t\t virus can survive for more than 6 hours on countertops and other hard surfaces \t\t\t such as doorknobs and for 30 minutes on hands clothing or tissue Close contact If an infected person coughs or sneezes near you \t\t\t you could breathe in RSV thats in his or her saliva or mucus The virus spreads easily in crowded settings such as child \t\t care facilities preschools churches and nursing homes Children attending \t\t school often spread the virus to their parents and siblings The incubation \t\t periodthe time from exposure to RSV until you have symptomsranges from 2 to 8 \t\t days but usually is 4 to 6 days 1 You \t\t are most likely to spread the virus within the first several days after \t\t symptoms of RSV infection begin You remain contagious for up to 8 days or \t\t longer Babies and young children may spread the virus for at least 3 to 4 \t\t weeks Recent research suggests that it may be possible to be a carrier of the \t\t virus 3 or 4 months or longer because parts of the virus have been found to \t\t remain in some people long after symptoms have disappeared 2 Many different viruses such as the human \t\t metapneumovirus can cause lower \t\t respiratory tract infections in children 3 These viruses can cause symptoms that are similar to an RSV \t\t infection Your \t\t\t urinary tract is the system that makes urine and \t\t\t carries it out of your body It includes your \t\t\t bladder and kidneys and the tubes that connect them When germs get into this \t\t\t system they can cause an infection Most urinary tract \t\t\t infections are \t\t\t bladder infections A bladder infection usually is not \t\t\t serious if it is treated right away If you do not take care of a bladder \t\t\t infection it can spread to your kidneys A \t\t\t kidney infection is serious and can cause permanent \t\t\t damage You can take either product acetaminophen or Excedrin Migraine Only take one since Excedrin Migraine contains acetaminophen as one of the three active ingredients along with caffeine and aspirin Make sure to follow the instructions on the bottle closely to make sure you are taking appropriately and for the correct reasons It should be all right to use an overthecounter cream for treatment of yeast infection during menstruation Without knowing the exact product it is hard to be completely sure It would be wise to call the triage nurse from your physicians office and consult them about your situation Both Vicodin and clindamycin have side effects like upset stomach nausea and vomiting but not heartburn These medications currently do not have any known drug interactions with Zantac 150 ranitidine or Tums He should be fine taking all these products together However watch his symptoms If symptoms worsen you may want to seek medical advice to make sure he doesnt have another condition That response was appreciated The home remedies are something worth considering However Im hoping that a medical expert can answer the initial question Sincerely thank you for your input though For the uti problem my doctor suggested drinking cranberry juice to prevent them not cure them So try drinking more cranberry juice and of course water It could be any of the things that you mention including a yeast or bacterial infection or even an STD  but thats something that only a trip to the doctor can reveal My guess from the limited information available is that it is likely to be a skin irritation of some sort which can occur for a number of reasons If it is a skin irritation using a first rate penis health cream health professionals recommend Man1 Man Oil should help Look for one that includes a first rate emollient like shea butter as well as a powerful antioxidant like alpha lipoic acid Good luck If you do have sex while you are still experiencing a yeast infection make sure that you use a condom however its often best to try to wait until the yeast infection is gone just to reduce the risk of spreading it It also can sometimes be a little sore on the penis when the yeast infection is in full power Make sure you maintain proper overall penis health by using a quality penis nutrient cream health professionals recommend Man1 Man Oil Look for one that includes a superior antioxidant like alpha lipoic acid Good luck Pacemaker infections are not common but can occur Fever redness at the incision site significant pain or swelling and any discharge from the incision are all things that could raise suspicions of infection Its a great idea to have the pacemaker site checked out by your doctor in followup to make sure everything looks good id advice to seek medical attention right away Premenstrual yeast infections are fairly common The timing has been attributed to either a slight blunting of immune function at this time in the cycle or pH changes Menstrual flow is alkaline and the good vaginal bacterias prefer a more acidic environment Yet in your specific case you mention using both an over the counter treatment hopefully one with a truly active ingredient such as miconazole or clotrimazole AND prescription Difulcan tablets Frequentrecurrent yeast infections that do not respond to any of the prescribed treatments suggest a couple of POSSIBILITIES First that yeast is not the culprit or second that it is one of the atypical subtypes of yeast candida The easiest way to help unravel this question is to have the GYN do a yeast CULTURE the next time you have symptoms If the culture is negative then yeast is not the cause Some other conditions which can produce yeast type symptoms include 1 Cytolytic vaginitisthis is an overgrowth of the beneficial hydrogen peroxide producing lactobacili that help keep the vagina clear of undesirable bacteria An overgrowth can produce an itchy burning irritating discharge 2 Lichen sclerosusthis is a skin condition outside the vagina usually between the vaginal opening and the anus that can create intense itching and irritation 3 Contact dermatitisthis would be from a change in tamponspads new bubble bath etc If the yeast culture is positive then the lab can identify which of the yeast subtypes may be the villain Most yeast medications are developed for candida albicans about 80 of yeast infections are due to this The other 20 or so are uncommon subtypes eg candid glabrata To treat the less common subtypes clinicians may try boric acid vaginally or even painting with a gentian violet very messy If these are truly reoccurances of candida albicans you might need repeat or prolonged treatments A blood sugar or hemoglobin A 1C test can be considered If you have ever had someone give you oral sex or you use saliva for masturbation you may be getting exposure to yeast Yeast is present in the gut from the mouth to the rectum You can certainly try the so called lifestyle treatments for yeast Additional lifestyle methods which have been advocated for yeast infection prevention include a diet low in refined sugars and simple carbohydrates avoidance of tight jeans use of cotton underwear eating natural lactobacillus yogurt and others There are few if any good research studies which demonstrate that these methods are helpful but some women swear by them Bottom line although its more expensive a yeastcandida culture may help find a diagnosis and direct treatment if this pattern persists She needs to be taken back her pediatrition When you mentioned the sinus infection you said a possible sinus infection I am assuming it was not established 100 that she did in fact have one and if she has taken two rounds of antibiotics and both were different antibiotics I would take her bak and insist they ck for flu RSV bronchitis etc My 4 yr old grandaughter had the same thing and when the admitting DR from the ER called her regular Dr to let them know he was doing an admission the first thing the pediatrician asked was if the Grandmother was there meaning me I am a nurse and they were just blowing my daughter off thinking she was overreacting due to being a first time Mom It takes abou 5 minutes to do a simple test for RSV about 10 to ck for the flu and they did none of that and she had to stay in the hospital about 10 days because they didnt bother to run the proper tests An antibiotic will not help the cough it is only for infection However the cough after an illness is usually the longest symptom you have and can last some time If it becomes worse or prolongs more than a month I would ask the MD Also perhaps they should give him something specific for the cough Coughing is always worse at night and if could mean a better nights rest for him if he can not cough so much at night Also often a cough is actually good for getting rid of the junk that is in his lungs so he needs to cough some of it up and out I wouldnt worry too much at this point Ive had sinus problems most of my adult life and I feel for you First of all if youre blowing out clear junk rather than yellow or green mucus you probably dont have a sinus infection  at least not yet I wouldnt do that if I were you Try a nasal lavage with a buffered saline mixture Netti pots are my preference In my opinion NEVER us an over the counter other than Ayr or Ocean due to rebound effect You can Google that for further info Studies suggest that there isnt any evidence that changing your diet or eating pattern can prevent or cure a kidney infection Basically just follow your current eating habits If you have concerns about you eating patterns consult with a dietitian or your doctor Your ear is connected to your Eustachian tube which on its turn connect to your pharynx running close by your nose on its way The tube requires four essential muscles to operate Does dirty baby bottles cause RSV When were you told that you have a UTI and did you take antibiotics for it If not you should see a doctor asap for treatment as UTIs can spread to kidneys if left alone 1 Condoms  dont forget they can come in flavors 2 You can cut a condom open and use it as a covering for oral sex with a female 3 Plastic wrap found at your local grocery store can be used It may help reduce risk as well By your history your symptoms fit a diagnosis of a Vaginal Yeast Infection perfectly This can be caused by change in detergent soaps or even the material of your underwear This is something that must be treated and only gets worse with time If you have recently taking antibiotics they can also cause this Talk with your Mother cause my guess is she has experienced this herself Even without the discharge you could have an yeast infection or a numerous of STD Not everyone is going to have discharge as a symptom On the other hand if the pain is only during intercourse it could be due to dryness but highly unlikely with an odor Most importantly seek medical attention Is the herpes virus in drinking water Can water it be boiled safe It probably is a yeast infection but you need to tell your mom so she can get you medical attention She is a woman so she will understand There is actually nothing overthecounter that you can use for an ear infection that actually make it go away but you can give a product like Tylenol or acetaminophen for the ear pain Well make sure that you take your child though to their pediatrician healthcare provider to be evaluated and dont be alarmed if they say we are not going to give any antibiotics Believe it or not in most cases ear infections will actually resolve on their own This is a question that I think is great Because one of the things that I recommend to patients is they need to see their doctor or healthcare provider first As we may know a lot of overthecounter yeast infection treatments are available and a person can pick them up anywhere But when you are pregnant you want to go see your doctor to make sure that there is nothing else going on and also certain creams are preferred in pregnant women So it maybe a cream or suppository you may walk out with a prescription or he may give you a recommendation for one of the approved products which is Monistat which is available overthecounter But the physician or healthcare provider really needs to be involved in that If you have any questions or are unsure just come and talk to us we will be more than happy to help you If you have a red line running from the burn on your hand past your wrist it could already be infected and I would advise that you see a health care provider as soon as possible You should not use Epsom salts for a burn or ice You can submerge the area in cool water I would also not advise putting any antibiotic ointments or dressings until a health care provider has evaluated it Good question This really depends on what type of infection and how severe it is Typically if you have a small cut you can wash with soap and water and then apply a triple antibiotic ointment If the infection on the skin appears red warm to the touch painful or oozing you will need to see your health care provider Skin infections can be very difficult to treat and can require prescription antibiotics if not taken seriously You never want to take someone elses medication this is risky and not safe Antibiotics do not help with poison ivy I would recommend calling your local hospitals to see if they have a clinic or try visiting the instore clinics that are in some drugstores You can try products like Zanafel Ivy Dry and Tecnu that can help with drying up the oils causing the itching I always find out from my patients when they dont finish their antibiotics when they are supposed to and try to save them for a rainy day You should always finish your medications when you have an infection even if you feel better What many people do not know is that you can actually get a more severe infection because your body didnt benefit from the trial phase you decided to give it with a few days of pills rather than the full course Macrobid is an antibiotic that is very specific for bladder infections and nothing else so you cannot take this for your toothache I would advise calling your dentist as soon as possible and get it checked out Due to the fact that you are pregnant your options are limited I would also like to ask what you mean by sinus infection as a symptom I would also like to know if you went to a health care provider for further evaluation and if you were given any medications You can continue to use the neti pot because that is a saline type of solution and safe for you to use if you have sinus congestion or stuffiness however if your sinuses are draining too much that could be causing your cough I would highly recommend talking to your pharmacist and possibly going to see a health care provider for evaluation I have to draw the line when someone asks if they can take medication that was prescribed for their pet If you have a serious infection you are beyond Cipro my friend Any infection needs to be evaluated by a health care provider Serious infections usually mean a trip to the hospital for IV antibiotics We really need to focus in the US on inappropriate use of antibiotics  we are running out of choices to fight the bad bugs because of our careless use of antibiotics You should not be taking amoxicillin for a UTI  it will not help Antibiotics have specific uses for specific infections that is why it is important to see a doctor or health care provider for evaluation I encourage you to call your local hospital to see if they are running any free clinics or see one of the retail clinics in some of the pharmacy locations like CVS and Walgreens They will charge a minimal fee If you dont get this checked out your infection will get worse and you will probably end up in the hospital and require stronger medications which in the end lead to a bigger bill This is a very serious situation You should not be evaluating what antibiotics you should use that you have in the house for this She needs to be seen by a health care provider She may need stitches along with strong antibiotics because skin infections are very hard to treat and sometimes may even require IV antibiotics You may want to call a retail clinic to see if they handle this local hospital to see if they have a walk in clinic etc and if not go immediately to the emergency room  This really depends on what type of infection and how severe it is Typically if you have a small cut you can wash with soap and water and then apply a triple antibiotic ointment If the infection on the skin appears red warm to the touch painful or oozing you will need to see your healthcare provider Skin infections can be very difficult to treat and can require prescription antibiotics if not taken seriously My son is 7 and has had a stuffy noise and a bad caugh for a monthCan I give him a 300mgClindamycin I have severe sinus issues I have dealt with many things like this My advice even though I am not a doctor is to get a sinus wash to help relieve the pressure and smell Women should not be diagnosing their own vaginal infections They should be calling their gynecologist They should be speaking with the gynecologist about their symptoms If theres any questions they should go into their gynecologist and let the gynecologist look at the discharge look under the microscope possibly even do a culture and decide whether they need to have treatment or not because it is not healthy to keep using these over the counter treatments Ive had patients come to me and are constantly treating themselves for yeast and they dont even have yeast Whats the role of antibiotics in yeast infections It is clearly shown that if you take an antibiotic youre going to decrease the normal flora in your vagina and the yeast can overgrow and cause itching and burning and discharge Im no Dr but I think you may need to have that rechecked Ive had numerous yeast and bacterial infections and none have ever scabbed It may be different since you had a staph infection but honestly that sounds like herpes u can suffer hearing loss I find it very disappointing that an MD would answer this and not point out that yeast infections in young girls is also a sign of Diabetes Get your daughter tested It is a simple blood test  Yep supposed to and does Im a guy that spends a lot of time with his tool  and Id rather have my hand down my pants for fun instead of because Im constantly scratching but I used to have a penis that itched like mad I finally got around to trying Man1 Man Oil and have had no complaints since Go for it  Glad that the infection is gone  those are nasty Ive used Man1 Man Oil on my flaky member and it works really great for me My penis used to be kind of embarrassing at least when it was in one of its flaky stages but now I dont have to worry about that which is a real relief Can you get a staph infection from a hot tub If it truly is Staph then yes it is in your blood stream and will remain there forever Do not fear you just must eat and stay healthy and stay clean If you see someone with a boil RUN yes While it is best to keep Augmentin refrigerated at all times to maintain efficacy I am uncertain as to whether or not the efficacy was compromised because it was left out of the refrigerator all night It does not become dangerous to use after it has been left out of the refrigerator But it may not work to cure your sons infection and could prolong his illness To be on the safe side I would suggest getting a new prescription Without knowing anything else about your sons situation I would say that is the way to ensure he continues to get the most effective form of the medication Yes If your child develops a rash while taking amoxicillin it is important to contact hisher pediatrician immediately It could be a sign of an allergic reaction or a harmless side effect But the only way to tell is to have it examined by a doctor You can take a pain reliever such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen while taking birth control pills or penicillin There are no drug interactions between the pain relievers and your prescription medications You should always check with the pharmacist before taking OTC medications when you are using prescription medications I do not know know why UTI are so common in PD but do not believe it is from the PD or the medications I believe it is from a tendency to dehydration With declining mobility fluid tends to pool in the legs during the day and at night when the fluid shifts higher in the body to the body it is more easily filtered by the kidneys So  you quit drinking enough fluid to keep from being up all the time This leads decreased frequency of urination Urination will clear small amounts of bacteria and without that infection is more likely Hallucinations occur from a number of causes  UTI being one of them Also medications can cause this problem I try to reduce medications in the order of most likely to least likely My criteria are potential for side effects vs potential for motor benefit  and it is not an exact science 1 Artane or Cogentin 2 Amantadine 3 Selegiline 4 Rasagiline 5 Pramipexole or Ropinirole 6 Entacapone 7 Levodopa I would not want to stop levodopa and would likely start a medicine for hallucinations before that The two most commonly suggested in the US are quetiapine or clozapine I recommend probiotics a lot in FM especially for those with IBS and yeast issues There isnt really an established dose because there are so many different products and they havent been rigorously studied by the scientific community Ive seen dosage ranges from 50 billion to 300 billion CFUs but I dont think we really know  Many doctors report from their clinical experience that this approach makes sense and seems to help in certain people Trying to achieve a favorable bacterialyeast balance homeostatis in the intestines is clinically appropriate especially if one has problems resulting from unfavorable balances unfriendly vs friendly flora Candida yeast overgrowth is a good example of an unfriendly flora condition that can benefit from probiotic therapy to help normalize the intestinal flora In the end no pun intended I think the effective dose is whatever works best for a specific individual through trial and error and advice from your treating doctor Here are some foods that may help prevent urinary tract infections Cranberry products such as cranberries cranberry juice and cranberry extract Blueberries Fresh berry or fruit juices Fermented dairy products with probiotic bacteria ask your doctor about probiotic supplements Cinnamon Foods rich in vitamin A like sweet potatoes carrots spinach and kale  What is most concerning is that you dont check your blood sugars often Its possible that an infection could increase your sugars but you need to stay on top of it I suggest making an appointment with your doctor to get lab work done including an hemoglobin A1C This will give you an idea of what your average blood sugars have been over the past few months Then youll want to be more vigilant with diet and checking your blood sugar Anyone who has had gastric bypass should receive regular follow up yearly to deal with the challenges of maintaining weight loss and checking for deficiencies such as vitamin B12 iron and vitamin D I would make an appointment with you gastric bypass doctor for follow up if you havent already Take care of yourself That is a large amount to take considering the recommended amount for adults is 30 micrograms I would check with your healthcare provider on the amounts and possible medical connections I can find no reason to think it would cause a yeast infection For side effects and more info see this  Viral infections that lead to sinusitis may be contagious bacterial sinusitis is generally not Its important to remember that most viral upper respiratory infections common colds cause nasal congestion which may involve the sinuses If the viral sinus infection lasts well past the normal duration of a cold viral sinusitis may be diagnosed These viruses are highly contagious and likely to cause a cold in others who come in contact with them Bacterial sinusitis most often occurs as a complication of a viral common cold Bacteria that are normally present in the nose and throat take advantage of the viral infection to invade the inflamed sinus passages These sinusitiscausing bacteria may be passed from person to person but wont cause an infection unless the right conditions are present Unlike with cold viruses most people will not develop sinusitis even if they are exposed to the bacteria what other possible antibiotics are used for this The presence of hepatitis C infection in the liver triggers the human immune system which leads to inflammation Over time usually decades prolonged inflammation may cause scarring Extensive scarring in the liver is called cirrhosis When the liver becomes cirrhotic the liver fails to perform its normal functions liver failure and this leads to serious complications and even death Cirrhotic livers also are more prone to become cancerous For sinusitis caused by virus infection no antibiotic treatment is required Frequently recommended treatments include pain and fever medications such as acetaminophen Tylenol decongestants and mucolytics Bacterial infection of the sinuses is suspected when facial pain nasal discharge resembling pus and symptoms persist for longer than a week and are not responding to OTC nasal medications Acute sinus infection from bacteria is usually treated with antibiotic therapy aimed at treating the most common bacteria known to cause sinus infection since it is unusual to be able to get a reliable culture without aspirating the sinuses The five most common bacteria causing sinus infections are Streptococcus pneumoniae Haemophilus influenzae Moraxella catarrhalis Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes The antibiotics that are effective treatment for sinus infection must be able to kill these bacterial types Although amoxicillin Amoxil is an acceptable first antibiotic for an uncomplicated acute sinus infection many physicians choose amoxicillinclavulanate Augmentin as the firstline drug for treatment of a suspected bacterial sinus infection because it is usually effective against most of the species and strains of bacteria that cause the disease In the penicillin allergic individual cefaclor Ceclor loracarbef Lorabid clarithromycin Biaxin azithromycin Zithromax sulfamethoxazole Gantanol trimethoprim Bactrim Septra and other antibiotics may be used as first choices If a patient is not improving after five days of treatment with amoxicillin the patient may be switched to one of the above drugs or amoxicillinclavulanate Augmentin Generally an effective antibiotic needs to be continued for a minimum of 1014 days It is however not unusual to need to treat sinus infection for 1421 days Taking decongestants pseudoephedrine and mucolytics guaifenesin orally may be helpful in assisting drainage of sinus infection The treatment of chronic forms of sinus infection requires longer courses of medications such as Augmentin and may require a sinus drainage procedure This drainage typically requires a surgical operation to open the blocked sinus under general anesthesia In general antihistamines should be avoided unless it is felt that the sinusitis sinus infection is due to allergy such as from pollens dander or other environmental causes It is likely that the use of a topical nasal steroid spray will help reduce swelling in the allergic individual without the drying that is caused by using antihistamines although both are occasionally used In many people allergic sinusitis develops first and later bacterial infection occurs For these individuals early treatment of allergic sinusitis may prevent development of secondary bacterial sinusitis Not making direct contact with skin clothing and any items that come in contact with either MRSA patients or MRSA carriers is the best way to avoid MRSA infection In many instances this situation is simply not practical because such infected individuals or carriers are not immediately identifiable What people can do is to treat and cover for example antiseptic cream and a BandAid any skin breaks and use excellent hygiene practices for example hand washing with soap after personal contact or toilet use washing clothes that potentially came in contact with MRSA patients or carriers and using disposable items when treating MRSA patients Also available at most stores are antiseptic solutions and wipes to both clean hands and surfaces that may contact MRSA These measures help control the spread of MRSA Pregnant women need to consult with their doctors if they are infected or are carriers of MRSA Although MRSA is not transmitted to infants by breastfeeding there are a few reports that infants can be infected by their mothers who have MRSA but this seems to be an infrequent situation Some pregnant MRSA carriers have been successfully treated with the antibiotic mupirocin cream Bactroban In 2007 the first incidence of MRSA in a pet was recorded Although relatively rare MRSA can be transferred between pets and humans MRSA has been documented in dogs cats and horses but may be found in other animals in the future Care and treatments are similar to those in humans but a veterinarian should be consulted on all potential cases MRSA has been isolated from the environment for example beach sand and water but there is no good documentation that people have become infected from these sources Most authors suggest prevention methods should consist of a good soap and water shower after visiting the beach The CDC does not recommend 2010 guidelines general screening of patients for MRSA However the CDC does recommend that highrisk patients who are being admitted to the hospital be screened for MRSA and then if positive for MRSA follow infection control guidelines during the hospital stay A recent study showed that the number of infections with both HMRSA and CMRSA has dropped since 20052008 and authorities speculate that such drops are due to infection control measures in hospitals and better home care measures listed below All women with the symptoms of infection described above should be treated Women without symptoms should not be treated Most experts do not recommend treating the sex partners of women with yeast vaginitis if they do not have symptoms themselves although this has been a controversial issue Absolutely You always need to let your doctor know if you are not getting better There can be many reasons a treatment doesnt work Your doctor will make sure that the diagnosis is correct Sometimes a new problem has appeared that is complicating your condition Other tests such as labwork or xrays may be needed to see what is going on Then he or she will consider other treatment options Sometimes a different antibiotic is necessary or a longer course of therapy The doctor may suggest other things you can be doing at home to make yourself feel better Here is more information about Help for Sinus Pain and Pressure If you still are not getting any better ask for a referral to an ears nose and throat specialist In females vaginal yeast infections can cause burning itching and sometimes a whitish chunky discharge Yeast is normally found in the vagina in very small amounts A yeast infection happens when this yeast begins to grow out of control Things that can cause this to happen include \tAntibiotics \tHormones \tPregnancy \tDiabetes \tWeakened immune system But there are other things that can also cause white discharge from the vagina You should make an appointment with your doctor or your gynecologist to see what is causing your symptoms Yes It is very possible that there can be an ear infection even if everything looked OK 2 days ago It is very common for a cold to lead to an ear infection in children The Eustachian tube drains the fluid out of the middle ear into the back of the throat A cold can cause this tube to become inflamed and swollen This traps fluid in the middle ear This fluid can then get infected with bacteria or viruses causing pressure and pain WebMD has a good slideshow that shows what happens with an ear infection httpwwwwebmdcomcoldandfluearinfectionssslideshowearinfectionanatomy So give her doctor a call now He or she can help your daughter get some relief I hope she feels better soon

before all my visits I hope that helps answer your question Missnsnow yes herpes is commonly transferred from one person to another just by what people conceive as harmless kissing Often the person who already has the herpes virus doesnt even realize they are carrying the disease There are several different strains of the herpes virus and the most popular types lay dormant and undetected in the infected individual thus making the transfer and spread of herpes a common occurrence from just a kiss A blister on our around your lip area is the first sign that you may have come in contact with a carrier of the herpes virus Unless you are in a monogamous relationship and have not kissed anyone but your partner for years there is no way to pinpoint who may have passed this lovely treat on to you you could have received the virus from a make out session 6 months ago and the disease was dormant until now Usually stress or lifestyle changes can bring a dormant herpes virus to life If you think you may have the start of a blister more commonly referred to as a cold sore make an appointment with your general practitioner asap They can give you a prescription that you can start taking right away Valtrex is commonly prescribed to alleviate the more serious symptoms of the herpes virus Please keep in mind once someone passes herpes on to you you are now a carrier as well for life There is no cure for herpes right now and it is quite simple to unknowingly become infected and then unknowingly pass on the virus as well Believe me had I known then what I know now I would have been a bit more selective about who I played tonsil hockey with Sorry I just saw the your whole question for some reason I could only see the first line of your question when I was answering it I want to adjust my answer I wasnt even answering your actual question No your vagina would not react in any way from kissing someone even if you did get the herpes virus from kissing it would only affect your mouth as in getting cold sores and blisters etc Like i said there are a few different strains of the virus and genital herpes can only be contracted if someone carrying the virus actually comes in contact with your vagina as in having oral sex or sexual intercourse If this person has never came in contact with your vagina in any way shape or form the itching downstairs isnt related to your make out session with this person and who he has or has not slept with definitely is not the cause of your issue Unless you get a cold sore within the next year or so im relatively certain that you have escaped this episode unscathedagain sorry about the misinformation my first answer really didnt answer your specific question and i wanted to give you a more clear answer If you have any itching or irritation down there and it lasts for more than a day or so and remains after showering and removing body sweat I would call your gynecologist and make an appointment for them to give you a once over Its quick and painless and it will put your mind at ease Thats one area that I wouldnt just wait it out Sleep anyway possible however preferably slightly upright you should not be feeling fluid go

httpwwwyeastinfectionnewscomtypestobaccoyeastinfections Tobacco Use When caused by the use of tobacco yeast infections can occur in anyone The reason that tobacco use increases the risk of oral thrush is that it alters the chemistry of your mouth allowing the Candida bacteria to move into a position of power Your mouth is already a prime area as far as Candida is concerned because in is generally both warm and moist The skin in some parts of your mouth is also very thin allowing Candida better access to the supplies of nutrients hidden just below the surface Generally your helper bacteria and immune system can stave off Candida infection but if you do something like chew tobacco smoke or just generally practice poor dental hygiene you could be helping to swing the balance in the direction of the bacteria If you have dentures you are at a particularly high risk of developing oral thrush particularly if the dentures dont fit well and if you also use tobacco yeast infections are very likely to develop Perhaps this will help better Good Luck Hi See Above Answer sorry it wont come up without a prompt glitch on WebMD Hi Its best you get it confirmed if it is a UTI the you can do oine

sounds like something more serious than a cold or sinus infection Could possibly be asthma bronchitis or something else I would go see an otolaryngologist and ask your doctors office to refer you to one they would recommend My nephew had a similar problem when he was about that age It helped tremendously in terms of his ability to breathe and reduced the amount that he was getting sick His voice was very deep and husky before the surgery because his adenoids were so swollen After the surgery his voice changed just a bit but not dramatically I would abviously consult with your doctor or ENT first to make sure its not something else though If I were you Id get my ear examined by an ENT specialist I had a problem in my ear in the past and visited a general physician who cleaned my ear  gave me some antibiotics advised me to visit an ENT specialist if the problem persists The problem persisted and I visited ENT specialist and was treated for the problem which was cured in 4 weeks instantly Antibiotics are very hard on your stomach if taken without food Google The Chronic Sinusitis Cure on the web may take care of your problem over the long term For the most part were talking about bacterial infections Almost 90 of travelers diarrhea cases are caused by bacteria The enterotoxigenic E coli ETEC strains of common bacteria that produce a toxin affecting the gut are the most important cause And then there are others such as salmonella shigella campylobacter vibrio and others that are less common Travelers diarrhea may also be caused by viruses such as norovirus which is in the news a lot because of how quickly it can spread through a cruise ship Parasitic travelers diarrhea is yet another kind Giardia intestinalis is the most common of these but there is a large number of parasites that can cause diarrhea These are less frequent You are correct It is earlymost ENTs wait THREE MONTHS of persistent middle ear fluid before even considering tubes as a therapeutic approach A weekandahalf is nothingmany children with a middle ear infection will have some residual fluid for a while so we just watch and wait unless your child has profound hearing loss or other health issues There are many seasonal reasons for the increase in the number of cases of otitis media middle ear infections but the No 1 culprit has got to be colds Colds are due to viruses of course and kids are notorious for collecting them The children that I see in daycare preschool and the elementary years are usually active members of the Cold of the Month Club Colds are the No 1 predisposing factor for ear infections If we could prevent or at least control colds there would certainly be fewer ear infections For generations researchers have tried to come up with an effective vaccine against colds but since there are over 200 different viruses  viruses that changemutate  a vaccine is not likely any time soon There are some good things about colds  really Colds are usually minor and selflimiting in about a week These little annoying viruses do stimulate the immune system and a stronger immune system can fight off the more serious attacks So even if we could prevent all colds it may be messing with Mother Nature and make things worse Like it not colds are here to stay at least for the foreseeable future The cold and flu season is closely tied to the ear infection season or as I call it snowtitis As the weather gets colds windows close and people tend to stay inside more In closed spaces viruses are more likely to spread If it is raining outside schools do not let the kids out for recess Ventilation in some schools is inadequate and hygiene is often nonexistent The janitorial staff will empty the trash but it would be rare for them to routinely disinfect surfaces Bathrooms may be clean at the start of the school day but tend to look like those outdoor privies in Mumbai by lunch time Some children are more earinfection prone If one or both parents had lots of ear infections the apple may not fall far from the tree Children who go to daycare or preschool at an early age are more prone to get sick Some of those viruses may set the stage for middleear infections After age six when kids have 50 or so colds under their immunity belt they get considerably fewer middle ear infections Breastfed children are less likely to get ear infections than children who are bottlefed and children who are given a bottle of milk to hold at bedtime are also more prone Children who are exposed to cigarette smoke tend to have more ear infections There have even been studies that show that families who heat with wood stoves or fireplaces in the winter have a higher incidence Smoke of any type is not good for kids The last risk factor worth mentioning is pacifiers Several European studies have shown these to be an earinfection risk in children under four I suspect kids over four are not using them at least I hope they are not Remember that ear pain is not necessarily an ear infection Parents and grandparents have been telling kids for generations to cover their ears when they are outside to prevent ear infections This practice will not prevent ear infections but can prevent some coldrelated ear pain that some not all people can experience The sensory receptors in the ear canal can really fire up from a cold breeze If you are coldsensitive wear a hat or ear muffs but dont think it is going to ward off infections Oh and dont tell this to your Grandma I dont want to get any nasty postings When you are getting out your winter clothing snow shovels windshield ice scrapes be prepared for a few trips to your medical provider You may want to consider getting a home otoscope to add to your winter supplies From my own clinical experience I do not find Zithromax strong enough for sinusitis Sinusitis can be VERY difficult to treat and relapses are common I once had to remain on antibiotics for three months for my own infection You need to call your medical provider again I suspect you are going to need another course of a different antibiotic even though your mucous is clear That depends Was the ciprofloxacin prescribed for YOU for a sinus infection that was diagnosed by your medical provider If so you would need to have the right dosage and amount based on your weight and severity of infection These are usually decided at the time you are being examined If you are selfdiagnosing and using a past prescription prescribed for a different medical reason or if you are being furnished with with a prescription from someone else I would strongly caution you against selftreatment in this manner Incidentally most cases of sinusitis are VIRAL and do not require antibiotics Have the urine recultured after you are off the ampicillin You may need to be examined to look for other possible causes to account for your continuing symptoms and definitely get examined if you are having any back kidney area pain The clindamycin will help the bacterial vaginitis but it will not help yeast at all As a matter of fact an antibiotic can worsen a yeast infection I typically advise my patients NOT to drink alcohol while on antibiotics While there is no specific contraindication to using alcohol with this particular drugh assuming you drink in moderation I still discourage it You can always call the medical provider who is treating you for patientspecific advice The topical vaginal yeast medications creams suppositories are safe to use Always check with your womens health provider just in case if you have any doubts or concerns We tend to get reexposed to various types of Strep throughout our lives What you are experiencing now as an adult would have nothing to do with your negative test as an infant Yes Strep B as well as several other bacterial Strep is not a virus types can grow out of a urine culture when you have an urinary tract infection but this was not lingering on since birth Strep throat is due to Group A Strep  a different bug entirely You can mow your lawn or exercise while under treatment for a Staph infection It will not be a problem Nocondoms dont cause yeast Yeast is an opportunistic organism that is present in our environment When yeast finds a warm dark moist place to take up residence like a vagina a diapered area etc it can take hold Yeasthappens Otitis media is a MIDDLE EAR INFECTION usually treated with antibiotics not drops A loud ringing could be tinnitus often caused by an INNER EAR condition not something that drops would help Coupled by this unusual painpressure in your head it would be prudent to consider a higherlevel medical evaluation from an Ear Nose and Throat ENT specialist It would not be possible to determine a cause of your head pressure blindly over the Internet Just say Mom I think I have a yeast infection Yeast is a VERY common problem that affects people of all ages from little infants who have yeast in their diaper areas to older folks who get yeast infections under their breasts or between their toes It is nothing to be embarrassed about and easy to treat As a matter of fact there are good yeast medications available over the counter or a prescription one that is only a pill that you swallow Yeast loves to live in warm dark moist areas and unfortunately women have one of these areas I assume you are talking about CocaColacorrect The answer is no Carbonated beverages will NOT cause a urinary tract infection The most common cause is the transference of bacteria from the anal area to the urinary opening women This can happen during sexual intercourse but can just happen as well Water is the best beverage to prevent a UTI but there is nothing wrong if you want to drink a Coke once in a while That would not be likely Yeast likes warm dark moist places like the vagina or inside a diaper The eyes and nose really doesnt have a welcoming environment that would be favorable to yeast You are safe Augmentin has two drugs amoxicillin and clauvulate Amoxicillin is dosed from 5080 mg per kilogram 22 pounds in a child with recurrent ear infectionsASSUMING an antibiotic is even needed You can do the math Newer recommendations do not favor using antibiotics unless the child meets certain medical criteria You can find the new recommendations  just published a few days ago  by an Internet search or read my blog on Family Webicine Yes you could have a sinus infection Symptoms can vary from person to person but some of the symptoms that you mentioned in your question are often seen in sinus infection Many sinus infections are viral and will be selflimiting in a weeks or so but some can be bacterial and require medical intervention like antibiotics In order for you to be properly diagnosed and treated you will need to see a health care professional for a examination first An allergy to your own urine is not possible Your labial itching may eventually help you overcome your fear of being examined since this may be the ONLY way you can have this problem properly diagnosed This is NOT something that can be done blindly over the Internet based solely on a vague description Having a sympathetic female physician PA or nurse practitioner should ease your discomfort and fear especially if you disclose it prior to your visit Have a trusted friend go with you Your doctor can even provide you with a shortacting antianxiety medication to help you overcome your fear In most cases a yeast infection is the underlying cause but since the labia is covered in skin and skin can have HUNDREDS of dermatological conditions that cause itching it would likely be futile to try and treat a condition that is not even diagnosed An ear infection will not cause your throat to be red but it can cause lymph nodes to swell An irritated throat can cause lymph nodes to swell The commonality of both ear pain and a red throat at the same time could be a virus or bacteria Since your doctor may not know this answer even after an exam many will just put you on an antibiotic Some will rely on the results of a Strep screen to make that determination Your dizziness may be related to your ear pressureinfection No Valtrex only works for herpes You will need to use a yeast medication Since I dont know if you are male or female both can get yeast including babies ask your pharmacist to recommend an appropriate overthecounter yeast medication assuming your selfdiagnosis is correct Sometimes if you can the symptoms long enough for your immune system to combat it Why would you wait Vaginal yeast infections are miserable and they are easy to treat with several overthecounter vaginal yeast medications If you dont like these messy creams or vaginal suppositories the you can ask your doctor for a prescription for Difulcan fluconazolea pill that you swallow that will do the trick The choice is yours You can try waiting it out and hoping for the best but personally I think the best course of action would be to just treat it Yes Exercise is not contraindicated when you are under antibiotic treatment for a sinus infection Assuming that you feel well and exercise is not exacerbating any of your symptoms you can exercise Nothese are different fungi Use an effective topical antiyeast cream available overthecounter will be your answer assuming your selfdiagnosis is correct Your pharmacist will help you select an appropriate one You will need to see your medical provider right away This is not something you can accurately diagnose or effectively treat at home A pimple may have caused a deeper skin infection in the skin lining of the ear canal called cellulitis This requires prompt treatment usually with an oral antibiotic andor an antibiotic ear drop A pimple will not cause a middle ear infection but it can certainly cause in external ear infection otitis externa It depends on the organism that is causing the UTI Since most are enteric bacteria from the colon doxycycline would not be the antibiotic of choice Keep taking your antibiotics Assuming it was a ten day course you have six more days to go to complete your treatment If you dont feel you have getting better you will need to be reexamined again As you know you cannot be examined diagnosed or treated over the Internet A Staph infection in the testicle area is painful in itself let alone have an abscess surgically lanced I have done this procedure on a number of patients and as careful as I am to limit discomfort there is still pain involved Just using lidocaine in this area is painful to inject and often very difficult to even use Many abscesses have just a thin layer of skin over them In order to numb this area the lidocaine has to be injected IN the skin not underneath in the pocket of pus This can be very difficult Sometimes just a quick puncture using a sterile scalpel is LESS PAINFUL that trying to numb up this challenging area Hopefully you are on the proper antibiotic and treatment regime and better by now If the Staph infection was caused by shaving you may want to consider going back to au natural again The plugged feeling may have nothing to do with the infection at this point but related to a Eustachian tube that is not regulating middle ear pressure It is not possible to predict how long this might last since every person is different when it comes to healing Eustachian tube dysfunction can last daysor months so hopefully yours will improve soon That would be a reasonable course of action Sinusitis can be a bit tricky to treat and often one course of antibiotics may not do it In light of the fact that you are still having facial pain and pressure and are still congested and coughing you may need further care  perhaps a stronger or different antibiotic assuming you had an antibiotic the first round and something more to control your symptoms I cant examine you so I have no way of confirming or disputing the diagnosis but there is a sinus mastoid sinus located behind both earsthe bony prominence that you feel The mastoid sinus connects with the middle ear so usually there are earrelated symptoms There are also lymph nodes in this area You need to call the ENT and ask for patientspecific advice Typically I use the vinegar solution as a PREVENTATIVE rather than a treatment The Cirprodex should be doing the job assuming this is a bacterial infection and not fungal No soap will not cause yeast per se Yeast is caused byyeast a fungus that floats around just about everywhere looking for a place to set up housekeeping Unfortunately the vagina is warm dark and moist  the perfect environment for yeast to occasionally occur If you do indeed have a bacterial infection in your vagina there is really little that you can do to treat it at home You will need to see your gynecologist or a different one so you can have a vaginal culture taken and have this discharge examined under a microscope Both bacterial vaginosis and Trichomoniasis can cause a malodorous discharge Yeast does not usually cause odorjust itching You can try active probiotics or probiotic drinks but sometimes if you are particularly prone to vaginal yeast infections you will still get them Some antibiotics are more notorious for causing them than others Make sure that your medical provider has a standing order for yeast medication if or when you go get vaginitis Oral Diflucan prescription only is nice and much less messy than vaginal creams or suppositories Nothis is not an antibiotic that would typically be used for urinary tract infections It would not be wise to selftreat Most of the timeunless you are in a lot of pain or have an active infection you will be fine Butthere are MANY variables including the speed of takeoff and landings airports etc that can affect your Eustachian tubes ability to equalize pressure There are a few things you can do 1 Try a decongestant like Sudafed before your flight or use a shortacting nasal decongestants 2 Ibuprofen can help too as an antiinflammatory 3 Chew gum but really what you need to do is swallow sips of water saliva etc If you feel pressure try yawning Your head wont explode if that is your concern but the increased vascular pressure may not be very comfortable for you If it hurtsdont do it A suggestion Decrease your max weight and increase your repetitions at a lower weight In other words lower the intensity of your workout at least for powerlifting until you feel better You are talking about three different types of vaginal pathogens Trichomoniasis is a parasite It is not uncommon for a woman to have all THREE and be misdiagnosed as only having one or two of the other pathogens but a bacteriayeast does not cause trichomoniasis Some women are overlyprone to vaginal yeast I have no way of delving into your medical history in order to find a reason or reasons for your recurrences or review your past treatment regimes but I do believe this problem can be solved by the right combination of medications and some extra care with sexual hygiene Your partner could be reintroducing the yeast or your specific sexual practices could be suspect Your medical provider should make sure that you do not have any underlying health issues such as diabetes that could be contributory Amoxicillin does not cause pink eye The standard treatment of pink eye conjunctivitis is with a prescription antibiotic drop or ointment You will need to call your medical provider the one that treated your ear infection and ask for a prescription to be called in You should not need to have another medical examination in most cases For a simple penile yeast infection balanitis you can have sex now if you use a condom and your sore penis is up to it Otherwise wait until you are symptom free I have no idea what you mean by a cyst condition and which antibiotic you are taking and for why so I would suggest you call your doctor for patientspecific advice  someone who knows the details of your case When you are not sexually involvedeveryou do not have to worry about an occasion missed period It happens quite often to younger women I suspect that you will have a normal period next month Get your yeast infection properly treated since they can be miserable There are prescription pills that can be taken orally if prescribed by your doctor they will usually do this without seeing or examining you or you can get some Monistat over the counter You may have two different types of ear problems The ear that was prescribed drops assuming these are antibiotic or antibioticsteroid dropsyou didnt say would be for an EXTERNAL ear infection like swimmers ear otitis externa Your other ear that is painful could be due to middle ear pressure or even a middle ear infection in progress The eardrum may not have been red or bulging at the time of this exam but the pressure could still cause pain Since I have no way of making that determination blindly over the Internet you would need to contact that medical provider again  someone that can reexamine your ear Obviously an accurate diagnosis is the key to and effective treatment I dont have any way of knowing if your vaginal discharge is an STD or not since I cant examine you look at the discharge under a microscope or test it in a lab nor do I know your sexual history or your boyfriends sexual history The only thing you can do if your doctors treatment is not working is to go backbe reexamined and be tested this time by a vaginal culture or smear A person can have a yeast infection AND something else so if you are worried about an STD that something else will need to be specifically tested No This is not an appropriate antibiotic for a kidney infection Please see a medical provider so that you can be properly examined and diagnosed Staph like a skin infection is technically contagious but a urinary tract infection caused by Staph is NOT contagiousyou cannot spread it to someone else I assume you are being treated so a urinalysis or culture after treatment would provide you with the proof of cure assurance  is one possibility an inner ear infection that is really diagnosed by symptoms alone the doctor cannot see your inner ear You could be many many causes for your symptoms so consider getting a second opinion from a neurologist because of the headache Ecoli is the most common bacteria that causes a urinary tract infection UTI Assuming you are a female men rarely get UTIs the bacteria came from your own rectum located quite near the vaginaurethra Bacteria that normally live in the colon can thrive in the neighboring vaginal area as well Since the female urethra is so short it doesnt take much for the bacteria to migrate into the bladder Sexual intercourse often helps it along Depends If the cause of the sinus infection or respiratory problem is BACTERIAL and the particular bacteria is felt to be medicallysensitive to this potent antibiotic than it may help Most sinus and respiratory infections are VIRAL however and viruses do not respond to any antibiotic It is best that you avoid selftreatment using an previouslyprescribed medication or a medication that was prescribed for others In most cases a draining ear otorrhea in someone with tubes the infection is treated with a prescription antibiotic ear drop like Ciprodex or another drug in this class Not all eardrops can or should be used in an ear with tubes so you will need have it specifically prescribed I am assuming you had a MIDDLE EAR infection there are different typesnot a common problem for a 40 year old but happens nonetheless Fluid can be from a few different sources Middle ear infections can sometimes cause the eardrum to breakrupture Small ruptures could create a leak and large ruptures can cause a flood of fluid usually accompanied by blood Fluid can also be caused by water in the ear canal perhaps trapped behind a little wax dam When you lie down more heat is created in the ear canal and these little dams can break causing this trapped water to come out on your pillow or show in your outer ear It can be yellow waxstained or clear Qtip users tend to create a lot of these wax dams Neither one of these conditions is considered serious even a tiny rupture Most will heal in a few weeks You can see your medical provider to be properly examined and to make sure the infection has resolved Many times the source of this fluid may not be obvious since the dam may have broken and the eardrum may have healed Assuming you are not having ear pain or signs of infection you could wait it out a bit longeror see your doctor Since you are six weeks after your infection it may be best to be examined Obviously I cant specifically answer that question since I do not know anything about your daughters medical historynot even her current age My advice is to work closely with an ENT specialist to solve this issue He may need to sample the fluid in her middle ear to culture it called a tympanocentesis or she may need the benefits of having tubes placed in her eardrums MRSA can make it into the middle ear but this would be uncommon All of these diagnostic and treatment efforts should reduce the frequency of her ear infections and preserve her precious hearing It is possible but unfortunately I have no way of accurately diagnosing you based solely on the information you have provided It would not be inappropriate for you to try a vaginal yeast medication available overthecounter The pharmacist can help select one for you Parents are relegated to determine if a child has a possible ear infection based solely on symptoms and signs unless they have a home otoscope a tool that allows a look inside the ear and know how to use it Those of us in the clinical trenches know that symptoms and signs are not necessarily predictive of a definitive diagnosis A recent twoyear study in Finland looked at 469 children ages 635 months and tested the predictive value of common middle ear infection symptoms earrubbing or pulling irritability less playful excessive crying poor appetite restless sleep runny nose congestion vomiting diarrhea and fever The diagnosis of a middle ear infection otitis media requires a certain diagnostic criteria Middle ear fluid detected by pneumatic otoscopy  this is the little bulb syringe attached to the otoscope that puffs air against the eardrum to check for mobility the normal in and out movement of the eardrum Abnormal color opacity bulging shape of the eardrum Middle ear infections are typically bulging and have a distinct red or yellow color instead of shiny white In this study not one but three different physicians systematically examined the ears of children strongly suspected by the parents as having a middle ear infection based on symptoms alone The results The duration and severity of the symptoms were NOT predictive of a middle ear infection Earrubbing and pulling long thought to be predictive of ear pain was proven to be an invalid sign It was actually more common in children who did NOT have a middle ear infection Fever was also NOT a predictive sign A prior cold was NOT a predictive sign in this study although statistically most children who get middle ear infection usually do have a cold Conjunctivitis pink eye may be a presumptive sign in some not all cases The only definitive way to diagnose a child with a middle ear infection is by a careful systematic medical examination by an experienced clinician using a pneumatic otoscope I see these false alarms nearly every day in my clinical practice Parents believe their children have an ear infection when in reality they do not Many parents will still demand antibiotics just in case or come up with some compelling stories like going out of town tomorrow a seriously ill grandparent or upcoming air travel in an effort to plead their case Cursory or incomplete examinations by hurried clinicians tend to overread ear examination findings resulting in inaccurate diagnoses I find this quite often in emergency room or urgent care visits Here are 10 facts about ear infection 1 Not all middle ear infections in children not including babies under the age of three months require antibiotics As a matter of fact over 90 percent of middle ear infections will selfresolve in a few days on their own without any medical intervention Shocking It is perfectly fine to wait a few days to see if the bodys immune system orchestrates the cure 2 Middle ear infections hurt Regardless of the presence of fever harmless a child in pain should be treated with acetaminophen Tylenol or ibuprofen Advil Motrin at an appropriate dose for the pain not the fever 3 Fever is harmless and does not need to be treated in most cases 4 Middle ear infections are not emergencies They really have no place in the emergency room 5 Not all recurrent ear infection will result in children getting tubes However if middle ear fluid is present for more than three months andor children are having hearing loss an ENT specialist should be consulted 6 Children in daycare get more ear infections The fall and winter months have the highest incidence 7 Children exposed to ANY secondary cigarette smoke get more ear infections If you smoke around your children you should be arrested 8 Children who are breastfed for at least six months get less ear infections that bottlefed babies 9 Children who have a nighttime bottle in the crib or depend on a pacifier tend to have more ear infections 10 Children do grow out of ear infections We see a marked reduction after age six so hang in there Now go buy a home otoscope and start practicing If you do not have active lesions at the time of your test not sure what KIND of STD tests you hadnot all of them even check for herpes it could have been a false negative test If you are continuing to have unprotected sex you could have picked up herpes 2 anytime There are no laboratory tests that will prove when you got it Otorrhea fluid leaking from the ear is most likely from a ruptured eardrum not as serious as it sounds but of course this is just a guess since I have no way of examining him The Ciprodex should help but many medical providers would also use an appropriate ORAL antibiotic There is absolutely no way to determine even if I could examine him the duration of this drainage It will stop as the rupture heals Fever rarely concerns me It is just the bodys way of fighting the infection Fever alone is not an indication to rush the ER so if your child is comfortable just wait until Monday and speak with the ENT Of course you know your son the best so use your best judgment in this case A fever is very nonspecific  there can be many things causing his fever but if he has an ear infection this is the most likely culprit Most ear infections are preceded by a cold so even colds can cause fevers of this magnitude but unfortunately I do not know enough about your child or his particular case to know if something else is going on Dont let a fever frighten you Children can get some pretty impressive fevers Medical providers rarely get excited with fevers under 105F in a oneyearold Children tend to get higher fevers because their immune system is not very good the fever helps fight infection and their cooling system is not very efficient we cool by sweating over a large skin surface area so the smaller the body the less cooling Most fevers should improve on day three or four of the illness but if it does not or if you child is experiencing any other worrisome symptoms you will need to have him reexamined Ear infections middle ear infections typically cause pain and often fever If you are not experiencing these symptoms it is not very likely you have an ear infection Crackling sounds in the ear can be caused by many things When the Eustachian tubes a tiny ventilation tube that runs from your middle ear  the area on the other side of your eardrum equalizes pressure you may hear a pop or crackling sound Fluid effusion in the middle ear can cause crackling Yes even a wax impaction lying against the eardrum or a stray hair can do this Less commonly other middle ear and inner ear disorders can cause this sensation The only way you can begin to pinpoint the cause is to see your medical provider or an ENT for a handson examination Treatment would depend on on your diagnosis There are plenty of best hospitals I found this to be a reasonable source httphealthusnewscombesthospitals They are listed by specialty including ENT It would depend on the type of ear infection a MIDDLE ear infection or an EXTERNAL ear infection Swimmers ear Yes it is possible Swimming with a middle ear infection especially if there was diving or underwater swimming could be painful A deep dive could actually rupture an eardrum if you have a lot of middle ear pressure Swimming around on the surface of the water is not usually a problem Swimmers ear otitis externa is often caused by water exposure so it is a good idea not to overly expose the ear canal to even more water until it has been treated Wearing a formfitted ear plug may be helpful You can swim when you have a yeast infection It will not contaminate the pool or affect others Maybe Amoxicillin is excreted slightly through the tears so it may help a mild case but those antibiotic eye drops are better Lie her down and put the drops in the nasal corners of those tightlyclosed eyes Then pull down her lower lid or trick her into opening her eyes and those drops will slide right in It will need to be treated with an appropriate course of antibiotics There can be several reasons Since I cant examine your ear or even know the underlying reason you are using the Ciprodex there are several different types of ear infections it is difficult for me to blindly determine a reason One reason could be ear canal swelling In otitis externa the ear canal can nearly swell shut Some clinicians will insert a wick in the ear canal to allow those drops to penetrate Other reason is a wax impaction or a canal filled with pus or other debris Many clinicians will not attempt to clean out the ear when it is painful so if you have a blockage of debris those drops will NOT go in I would suggest that you consult the clinician currently treating you since they examined you last Yes but dont pee in the pool if you are taking pyridium it is bright orange If the pain is worse on your antibiotics then you need to consult your treating medical provider today You may need a change in your antibiotic therapy based on your urine culture hopefully this was done a stronger antibiotic or further evaluation of your kidney pain Perhaps you have a kidney stone Your medical provider may order a kidney ultrasound The last five day treatment is probably azithromycin  an antibiotic that you take for five days but stays working for ten This drug is convenient to take but many of the pathogens that cause middle ear infections in children are now resistant to it The first drug was probably amoxicillin Your son may need something else assuming the infection is a bacterial type Many ear infections are viral A child under six months who is getting ear infection is more likely to be a frequentflyer of sorts They may end up getting LOTS of them and often end up getting tubes A child in daycare or one exposed to tobacco smoke is likely to get more ear infections A child who was not or is not breat fed will also get more The next step may be to see an ENT specialist for a consultation If your child has middle ear fluid that has been persistent the ENT may recommend tubes No there are not age limits for vaginal yeast infections I see them in babies Monistat vaginal cream and other antifungal vaginal creams are fine to use She can just it on the outside It does not have to be inserted in the vagina with the applicator unless your daughter is already having her periods andor uses a tampon If she is able to do this easily and painlessly it is also fine to do There is a nice pill she can take called Diflucan but she will need a prescription It is not the strongest antibiotic for kids but it is effective for bacterial sinusitis Bacterial sinusitis is uncommon in two year olds since most of their sinuses are immature and undeveloped at this age Statistically most of these toddler sinus infections are VIRAL and viruses as you probably know will not respond to ANY antibiotic no matter how strong Bacterial sinusitis assuming this is what your two year old actually has can be tricky to treat often requiring longer antibiotic courses or a different type of antibiotic Failure to respond in seven days may necessitate a reevaluation of this treatment regime Just because he still has thick or colored mucous does not mean that a the antibiotic is not helping or b the cause is bacterial and not viral Viral infections can cause stagnation of mucous and that alone can result in thick greenyellow mucous You cant really use snot color as a diagnostic clue no matter what your mother told you Sometimes The nasolacrimal duct connects the eye to the nose and of course the nose is connected to the paranasal sinuses An infection in one of these areas can spread to another If your history as true and I have no doubt that you are being honest the most likely cause IS a yeast infection Yeast loves warm dark moist places and your vagina fits the bill perfectly Yeast is notorious for causing extreme itching swelling redness and a discharge so do not hesitate to talk to your mother In most cases your mother has experienced vaginal yeast infections herself and will be able to help you There are many effective overthecounter medications and even an oral pill that your medical provider can prescribe This problem can be easily fixed so dont delay Assuming you are talking about a MIDDLE ear infection you should have experienced relief in three daysIF a you were properly and accurately diagnosed b your ear infection was due to a bacteria and not a virus and c the antibiotic you are taking was the proper choice and dosage Failure to respond to your treatment is a reason to call your medical provider for patientspecific advice Since you are still having dizziness and head pressure it would be wise to be reexamined I have been seeing kids for over 40 years and I cannot recall one incident where a child fainted from pink eye or even an ear infection As a matter of fact it is pretty rare for a six year old to faint PERIOD so yes I think your little girl deserves a thorough examination to find a reasonI just cant buy the pink eyeear infection theory Sorry Like you I am a bit skeptical I dont know anything about your little girl or have the ability to examine her so I dont really have any wild guesses as to why she fainted or if this was a seizure but I do feel she deserves a workup I would suggest a pediatric neurologist No The drainage from the sinuses is quickly contaminated from nasal mouth and throat germs so you cannot diagnose sinusitis by this method Sinusitis is typically diagnosed by an array of characteristic symptoms sinus pressure pain coupled with corresponding examination findings tenderness decreased light with transillumination  shining a bright light into the sinus area in a darkened room or by xray or CT scan findings Most cases of sinusitis are viral and will be selflimiting but some require antibiotics or allergy mangement See your medical provider The only sinuses that are really developed by that age would be the ethmoid sinuses located on each side of the nose and these rarely become infected The major paranasal sinsues the frontals and maxillaries do not fully develop until the early teen years I cant say I have seen an 8 month old with true sinus infection in 40 years of practice but I have seen other clinicians diagnose one clinically It would be highly unlikely for an infant to have a sinus infection confirmed by an imaging study but theoretically I guess it can happen What area are we talking about here I am not a fan of squeezing Staph infections or selfsurgery since this can potentially spread the infection deeper Your question is a bit vague First it depends on the TYPE of ear infection there are many different kinds If the breastfeeding mother has a middle ear infection for example there are many safe antibiotics that can be used If the infant has a middle ear infection this can be safely treated as well I cant imagine there is a causative relationship The yeast in yogurt is different that the yeast that causes vaginal yeast infections Eating yogurt does not cause vaginitis so it just may be a strange coincidence As a matter of fact many naturalist recommend eating yogurt as a preventative Personally I dont think that helps either You can just not eat yogurt if you feel if you are having a rare unproven relationship Many people use garlic for treatment of various ailments but as far as a yeast infection is concerned I assume you mean a vaginal yeast infection there are much better REAL medications for this disorder at the pharmacy overthecounter Only if you had yeast in your mouth Yes or you can add some 1 OTC hydrocortisone cream to the miconazole to help with the itching I wish that I could address your question but without the ability to see your infection firsthand I would only be making a blind guess not something that medical providers like to do My suggestion to you is to call your medical provider  someone who has seen this infection and is treating you  for patient specific advice This infection is being treated and managed appropriately so I cannot imagine that you will not get better Hey you are better off seeing a medical provider FIRST so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated Most sinus infections assuming you have selfdiagnosed correctly are viral and do not require ANY antibiotics If there is a bacterial component you may need to treat for more days have from leftover prescriptions Not treating an infection completely encouraged resistant organisms so it is entirely possible that neither one of those antibiotics would be appropriate If the cough is caused by postnasal drainage from your sinusitis you can try taking a long acting antihistamine Claritin or Zyrtec to dry up some of the drainage Cough can also be triggered by simple irriation so a teaspoonful of honey or glycerinebased cough drops may help Drink plenty of fluids and humidify the air you breathe at night humidifier or vaporizer If all fails you can try an OTC cough suppressant like Delsym or ask your medical provider for a prescription cough medication primarily at night No Cornstarch has been used to help control moistureand moisture can predispose a baby to yeast but the best treatment for a diaper yeast infection would be a cream or ointment that is specifically for yeast Micatin Lotrimin Monistat etc No urinary tract infections are not contagious A person with a bacterial infection in their urinary tract could indeed transfer these bacteria to a vagina during sexual intercourse but it would be unlikely for the exposed person to get a urinary tract infection for this alone With that said you can develop a urinary tract infection on your own from sexual activity As a matter of fact this is listed as one of the most common causes In most cases it your own bacteria  bacteria from your colon and rectal area  that become contaminated or colonized in your vaginal area that gets transferred into your urethrabladder during sexual activity Not really Yeast tends to be on the skin surface The culture of your urine likely revealed an organism that was not sensitive to the ciprofloxacin This may be why there was a change in the antibiotic but you would need to talk to your doctors office to confirm that this was the reason Another reason could be insurance coverage Diffucan is not a 100 guaranteed cure so there can be treatment failure Also each person and each yeast infection will respond individually so it would be impossible to know how YOU will respond versus someone else As a rule most women improve in a few days to a week but again there is no way to conclusively predict an individual response Those are signs of a continuing or recurrent yeast infection so you may need that Difucan again I am surprised that the cream was not helpful so perhaps your medical provider can suggest a different topical or vaginal medication for you to use About 99 will heal without surgery Cefdinir should be out of your system in a day or sorelatively fast but that does not mean your diarrhea assuming it was caused by this antibiotic will immediately stop Everyone heals at different speeds so it would be impossible to predict how long your ears would remain plugged It can be a few daysor a few weeks In some cases the Eustachian tube the cause of the plugged feeling can last much longer but lets hope that yours will be shortlived Most sinus infections are caused by viruses and viruses tend to last about a week Viruses are notorious for causing systemic whole body symptoms such as fatigue Keeping in mind that everyone is different in their recovery responses to an infections most people should feel better and more energized in a week or less A tapeworm or gallbladder disease in a fiveyear old is extremely rare so instead of trying to diagnose her it would be best for her to see a pediatric gastroenterologist for a diagnostic workup There is really no way to blindly narrow down the many possibilties over the Internet Eczema atopic dermatitis can become worse during times of stress The dry rash can appear on any part of the body that has skin If you are having ongoing issues seeing a dermatologist would be appropriate Your vaginal yeast infection would not be related to eczema No cure other than Tincture of Time Most of these areas of pigmentation caused by skin disorders will fade over time There are no specific treatments Yesyour bodys immune system can often take care of it Noa vaginal yeast infections is caused by yeast Candida monilia Colase  a stool softener  will not cause a yeast infection It is time for you to see an ENT specialistthere are more things in the ear that can cause pressure symptoms other than the few things that can be seen on a routine exam You cannot diagnose these things easily and certainly not over the Internet so you need an expert Heaing loss for six monthsand pressurecould be many things from middle ear  Eustachian tube problems and TMJ disorders to the more difficulttodiagnose inner ear disorders And the fact that the the right side of your face is numb is very troubling This alone adds to the complexity of the causes As a nondrinker I dont feel anyone should consume alcohol while being treated with antibiotics but one or two drinks would probably not cause you any harm or adverse effects The most important thing for you to do while on Bactrim is to drink plenty of water so if you will just follow those one or two drinks with a fullglass or two of water you should be fine The most important thing is getting your UTI properly treated Excessive alcohol consumption can interfere with judgment and impair inhibitions impaired inhibitions can lead to sex and sex can lead to another urinary tract infectiona vicious cycle Yeast infections can occur on anyoneany agewhether they are a diabetic and taking insulin or not Yeast infections are caused by fungus yeast not vitamins Vitamin D does not cause you to have or be prone to fungal infections You can have three of your sinuses infected but the this is consider ONE infection Assuming you are talking about your paranasal sinuses you have a pairs of frontal sinuses forehead maxillary sinuses below your eyes in the cheek bone an ethmoid sinuses on each side of your nose It really doesnt matter if you had sinus infection in all SIX paranasal sinuses they are treated as ONE I also hear people say they had double pneumonia or a doubleear infection They are referring to an infection ONE infection that may be in both ears or in both lungs NOthat would be very very unlikely Yeast can occur on ANY skin or mucous membrane surfaces like the mouth in the groin between the toes or under breasts Men can get yeast infections A vagina is not a requirement Are you sure you do not have a vagina If you had a hysterectomy only the uterus and ovaries were removed Woman are left with a vagina The urine should be cultured to determine the pathogen causing the infection and the best antibiotic for that particular pathogen Not all people with classic symptoms of the UTI actually have one so perhaps you will need to see a urologist to look for other possibilities Most sinus infections are viral and do not require any antibiotics For the few that are bacterial amoxillin at an appropriate dose or an appropriate length of time would be one of the antibiotic choices If you are selfdiagnosing and selftreating with an old prescription or someone elses prescription I would not recommend that you do this Not enough information Rather than spend your time in selfdiagnosis from the flu to reasons for your head pain like sinusitis it may be more beneficial for you to seek proper medical care Marijuana can remain in the body for weeks since it can be bound to body fat Some hair tests can show THC for months There are really no medical conditions including pregnancy that would cause a false positive THC so most clinicians and law enforcement agencies would consider her test positive regardless of her conviction that she has not been using marijuana or around people who are Being pregnant and showing positive THC can be very problematic for her First it needs to be conclusively PROVEN that he actually has shinglesThe wrist is not a place one would usually see it since herpes zoster the medical name for shingles follows a nerve pathway There are lab tests that can be done ordered by his doctor including a direct herpes culture to any fresh sores that he may get I see shingles quite several times a year in my pediatric practice I cant say it is common but shingles does occur in children As this point I would question the diagnosis since shingles also tends to break out in the exact same area each timenot on the shoulder once and then the wrist Ask to see a urologist It is not normal to have three KIDNEY infections in three months You need a more thorough diagnostic workup and kidney stones can cause infections Neither A bacteria is a bacteria A virus is a virus Vaginal yeast is a YEAST fungus The duration of treatment as well as the success of your treatment depends on WHAT you are using and how well your body responds to that particular treatment Assuming you were accurately diagnosed and properly treated most women are better in less than a week No I am sorry but mineral oil will be an effective treatment for an ear infection Most infections in the sinuses are VIRAL and not bacterial so penicillin would not likely help in this case I do not know that how you were diagnosed with Strep Unless you had a lab test to confirm it you may not have Strep at all A visual diagnosis is wrong about half the time Absolutely And the reverse it also true a breastfed baby with thrush can transmit this yeast to his Moms nipples This is an easyfix Call the babys pediatrican for advice and some prescription help Impetigo is the disease Staph or Staphylococcus is the one of the bacteria types that can cause impetigo the other is Strep Yes Staph can normally appear ON the skin but when you pick at it you OPEN the skin and allow surface Staph to go deeper and cause an infection No yeast infections are caused byyeast Yeast likes warm dark moist places and the vagina tends to fit the environmental conditions Whether you have hair or not in the pubic area has no influence on yeast so I suggest that you consult your medical provider for a definite treatment like oral Difucan Both a sinus infection and a middle ear infection can cause dizziness While antibiotics do not typically cause dizziness you may find it listed among the lesscommon side effects Augmentin typically causes an upset stomach or diarrhea but not dizziness Keep in mind that there can be hundreds of other causes of dizziness so if your symptoms persist you will need to consult your medical provider A hysterectomy only removes the uterus Any woman of any age who still has a vagina can most definitely get a vaginal yeast infection especially after being on systemic antibiotics It is prudent to use the over the counter yeast medication that you have mentioned the antiitch medication would only treat the itch not the cause Obviously if you are not improving you will need to consult your medical provider for patientspecific advice Yeseither one has the potential of setting the stage for a yeast infection Yes that is possible but holding urine would not be considered a common symptom Urinary tract infections typically cause dysuria pain on urination frequency urgency desire to urinate even after you finished urination and occasionally bloody urine UTIs can cause back kidney pain bladder pain and fever as well One might consciously or unconsciously hold urine because is uncomfortable to urinate Inflammation around the urethra could make it more difficult to urinate and result in the desire to hold In children especially consciously holding urine can lead to a urinary infection so there could be a connection between holding and UTIs It would not be likely that any vaginal yeast infection would cause right lower back pain No The chlamydia test is a DNA test and very accurate Yes Bactrim is not effective against Group A beta Streptococcus Yeshaving sex is safe Allergic reactions are not transmitted that way Assuming your husband was properly diagnosed many skin lesions will mimic ringwormtinea corporis an antifungal medication there are several over the counter medications that the pharmacist could suggest would likely help If you are talking about a vaginal yeast medication being used I would suggest that you use one more geared for skin fungus He will not grow boobs Normal No Can it happen Yes Depending on the pathogen that is causing your sinus infection most are viral some are mycoplama and some are bacterial the same pathogen cause also cause pneumonia at the same time Are you sure it is just a kidney infection and not a kidney STONE You may need a CT scan of your kidneys to be sure Keflex is an appropriate drug assuming the pathogen causing your infection has been identified and is sensitive to this drug Find out about your urine culture report IF you are still having severe pain you most definitely need to consult the medical provider who is treating you Noa yeast infection is caused by a fungus yeast Trichomoniasis Trich is caused by a parasite A person can have both No multivitamins do not cause yeast infections No A cold sore is herpes  not yeast Oral sex should be avoided if you have an active herpetic lesion No Your dental caries is not likely due to yeast so you did not cause it If your nose is extremely sore this is not normalnor is it necessarily a sign of a sinus infection I would suggest that you see a medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated Not all middle ear infections respond to amoxicillin and because you could not take the recommend dosage you are going to need an alternative antibiotic perhaps a stronger one that is not so hard on your GI tract Please call your doctor for a change in your therapy because you also have a sinus infection that needs treatment as well You should consult the medical provider who examined youthe one who knows that TYPE of ear infection you have I am guessing a middle ear infection the severity and the type of antibiotics you are taking Not all middle ear infections will be problematic after a few days but since I do not know the details of your case you need to get patientspecific advice from someone who has examined youor have someone examine your ears just prior to your journey An allergic reaction is often sudden HIVES that are very pruritic itchy An amoxicillin side effect usually occurs near the end of the course of treatment day 810 not day three and is bright red occuring all over the body This does not usually itch Soit could be either one I dont have enough specific information and the ability to examine your baby to offer you a definitive answer There is really no average time Most people with sinusitis do not have any loss of taste or smell but for those that do it can take several daysto several weeksor even longer for those senses to return As much as we would like to predict outcome healing time is so variable in humans that it would be impossible Yes Staph can grow in or around the eye and yes it is possible that contaminated examination equipment could somehow contribute to an infection If you do indeed have an urinary tract infection it needs to be properly treated See a medical provider have a urinanalysis and culture and there are safe antibiotics that can be used In the meantime drink plenty of waterfluids Any infection that progresses has the potential of causing issues with your pregancy or baby so it would be best to get this taken care of Why did you wait so long The response to treatment is very individualized Depending on the severity of the sinusitis the accuracy of the diagnosis the choicedosage of antibiotic and thepatients response to those antibiotics one could remain symptomatic for a week or more Since most sinus infections are viral the will eventually go away on their own The ones that require antibiotics may last a week or more Staph is contagious by DIRECT CONTACT so if the Staph skin infection is on the mouthor the genitals it can be transmitted by contact with those areas It can also be transmitted by the hands of the person if they have touched the infected areas and have not properly washed their hands Not all exposed persons will come down with a Staph infection In your own chlorinated pool Yes assuming the wound is not draining or oozing You can always cover small area of Staph with a waterproof bandaid but in most cases he will not contaminate a large pool or put others at risk if gte mso 9xml wWordDocument wViewNormalwView wZoom0wZoom wPunctuationKerningwPunctuationKerning

This will manage the yeast in a few days but you will still have inflammation A trick that I use for my little patients is to mix the yeast medication with an equal amount of hydrocortisone cream to help the redness and inflammation Put in on the diaper area at least 34 times per day Once this medication is rubbed in put a barrier cream or ointment over the top  something like plain ol vaseline Airout the diaper area as much as you can After a bowel movement you may need to put the in the bathtub or shower to make sure you get off all of the stool residual this can burn the skin Bad diaper rashes can also predispose the child to a secondary bacterial infection so if the skin is breaking down or bleeding you will need to contact her medical provider to see if an oral antibiotic would be

your ENT specialist can remove it for you This is called a cryptic tonsils tonsils with holes or crypts in them like the surface of the moon Cryptic tonsils can trap food particles and other debris This debris can hardencalcify and turn into a tonsillith tonsil stone These stones can dislodge from time to time and startle the person who has them They can also smell or taste bad There are no specific treatmens for these holes other than a tonsillectomy of course Gargling with warm salt water after means can help keep these holes from accumulating debris There is no relationship between cryptic tonsils and sinus infections They are two different conditions Your child have had a spontaneous rupture of the eardrum  natures way of dealing with the pressure andor infection Some ruptures are tiny and located along the margin of the eardrum  difficult to see and some are large and quite obvious Either way a ruptured eardrum will bleed and nearly all of them will completely heal in a few weeks It could be both Yeast infections in the vagina tend to itch urinary infections tend to be painful with urination only and can be accompanied by the urge to urinate even after you have urinated See your medical provider for a urinalysis to see if you do indeed have an infection needing to be treated A vaginal yeast infection can usually be treated over the counter with antiyeast vaginal medications If you are prescribed an ORAL antibiotic for your sinus infection it will sometimes help conjunctivitis as well but most of the time medical provider often prescribe a separate eye drop containing antibiotics What KIND of ear infection The only one that may benefit from an injection of a potent steroid would be an inner ear infection dizzy vertigo vomiting etc Cortisporin eardrops will only help otitis externa swimmers ear Since I dont know the reason for the steroid the type or severity of your ear infection ther is really no way to predict when or even if this treatment will work The two medications are compatible but many clinicians do not use antihistamines in children who have ear infections since this can thicken the middle ear fluid and make it more difficult to clear in some not all children Yeast infections just happen active sex life or not I see just as many yeast infections in babies and children as I do adults Some people are just more prone to yeast Not reallyvaginal yeast infections can just happen Even little children who are not on birth control pills or have any estrogen productions can get yeast infections While some women report they are more prone to yeast infections during different phases of their menstrual cycle the birth control pain is really not the cause No You are talking about three DIFFERENT types of vaginitis yeast is fungal  BV is bacterial  and Trich is a parasite  BV or yeast does not cause trich Of course you can catch all three at the same time Yesyeast can be transmitted to a susceptible partner Staph or Staphylococcus is a type of bacteria commonly found on the skin There are several different types Clindamycin is fineit is one of the antibiotics of choice for a Staph infection As far as a followup culture is concerned there is nothing inappropriate in having one to be sure the Staph has resolved from the antibiotic Ask the treating medical provider for patientspecific advice however since I do not know the TYPE of Staph that he has Infections are known to cause blood pressure changes so it would be possible that a severe sinus infection could do the same That is a personal skill that I really cant help you with very much In most cases a vaginal suppository or cream should not be expelled when you urinate A woman has gotta pee you know You bet If you have a vagina you can get a vaginal yeast infection because yeast likes warm dark moist places The vagina is one of them There are no viruses or bacteria that only cause bronchitis Any of the hundreds of respiratory organisms can do Most cases nearly all of bronchitis in children I dont know your daughters age are viral and do not require antibiotics ear infections often do not require them either but antibiotics have remained the mainstay of treatment Ear infections are not contagious Respiratory viruses are considered most contagious a day before you get sick and for about two days afterwards Since it has been a week your daughter is not likely contagious even if she still has some residual symptoms like a cough Doxycycline is not typically used for a kidney infectionunless the urine culture specifically shows a pathogen sensitivity to this drug Moderate alcohol consumption will not interfere with any of your overthecounter topical yeast treatments Yes it can especially if the urinary tract infection results in systemic symptoms like fever or involves the kidneys No its not unusual The effects of the illness will still exist because it takes a while a week or so for the bug to be annihilated by the penicillin and your immune system Also penicillin increases your white blood cell count and so your own body is still fighting the bug The medication itself doesnt fight it Your body is still going through the purging process of getting rid of the bug So you will still feel sick and tired for a while Taking too much penicillin can cause ill effects as well so try not to do that Just let it run its course Thank you so much for the response i have an appointment with my gynecologist and will know whats wrong with me In the interim the bleeding has now stopped and its been a week this far You need to get prompt medical attention for this Bloody urine hematuria is not ever normal and though passing a kidney stone can cause it I know from experience so can incipient kidney failure If you have pyelonephritis kidney infection you require antibiotic treatment You should go back to your doctor because there are quite a number of reasons why your symptoms may have not be alleviated such as the cause of your sinus infection may have not been bacterial rather viral therefore antibiotics were futile to the infection and so on  if you have a red blister that is fluid filled burns stings itches and hurts like a SOB then its quite possible warm H2O helps w the pain but it will have to be cultured by your dr to know for sure if it craters after the blister is gone then probably so dont have sex until you know for sure Sinus infections can cause tooth pain But I am unaware of a correlation between sinus infections and wisdom teeth You may have bacteria vaginosis call to schedule an appt with your gyno The development of scar tissue is how our bodies respond to a breach in our skin as when your cats claw pierced the skin of your upper lip Unfortunately scar tissue is not skin tissue and does not look the same or feel the same With time most scar tissue recedes in size and the pink color will turn more white making it less noticeable One thing you might try is very gently rubbing a little vitamin Ebased oil or cream over the area with the scar to help with the healing process and to diminish the appearance of the scar If it really is a problem youll want to talk to a plastic surgeon about your options Amoxicillin is best for treating sinusitis because it is usually effective and has few side effects It should not be used if you are allergic to amoxicillin or have been diagnosed with mononucleosis I HAD THIS HAPPEN TO ME SHECK TO SEE IF YOURE EXPERIENCING A YEAST INFECTION Its caused by bacteria called Bordetella pertussis This type of

kissing or sharing objects such as toothbrushes or eating utensils In general a person can only get herpes type 2 infection during sexual contact with someone who has a genital HSV2 infection It is important to know that both HSV1 and HSV2 can be spread even if sores are not present Pregnant women with genital herpes should talk to their doctor as genital herpes can be passed on to the baby during childbirth For many people with the herpes virus attacks or outbreaks of herpes can be brought on by the following conditions General illness from mild illnesses to serious conditions Fatigue Physical or emotional stress Immunosuppression due to AIDS or such medications as chemotherapy or steroids Trauma to the affected area including sexual activity Menstruation You can take steps to help prevent staph infections Any time you have a cut or skin breakdown wash it with soap and water keep it clean and dry use antiseptic ointment and keep it covered A couple of recent outbreaks among football players began when one team member had a boil and the infection was spread to other team members A staph infection is contagious if the wound is weeping or draining and if people share towels or other items that are contaminated Wearing foot coverings in locker rooms and other commonly used areas can help prevent contamination If the sore becomes unusually painful or red get prompt medical attention If red lines develop thats a sign the infection is spreading and needs immediate medical attention Left untreated a middle ear infection can have longterm effects that include the following Inner ear infection Scarring of the eardrum Hearing loss Mastoiditis infection of the skull behind the ear Meningitis infection in the tissues around the brain and spinal cord Speech development problems in children Facial paralysis This is an infection of the vagina caused by one of the many species of fungus called Candida A change in the chemical balance in the vagina allows the fungus to grow too rapidly and cause symptoms Studies conducted at the University of Michigan Health System showed that men do not generally pass a yeast infection to a woman during intercourse According to study author Barbara Reed MD MSPH it appears that the risk for recurrent infections is related to something else  perhaps the womans immune response to the yeast Interestingly however the study which looked at over 200 men and women came to another rather surprising conclusion Women who receive oral sex seem more likely to suffer from recurring vaginal yeast infections This was the case whether their partner showed signs of yeast infection in their mouth or not Were not saying that oral sex is a problem for everyone but if a woman is experiencing recurrent yeast infections these activities put her at an increased risk Reed says The CDC reports that up to 80 of women will have at least one yeast infection in their lifetime A hormone imbalance high blood sugar levels certain antibiotics birth control pills or stress can also cause a yeast infection just a change of pressure Getting ones teeth brushed and cleaned is imperative to eliminating the two diseases we address in dentistry caries cavities and periodontitis gum and bone disease If the teeth are not cleaned one is certain to lose teeth from those two diseases Piercing ones tongue is not a good idea The infection in the tongue piercing is a result of bacteria that is present in our mouth regardless of cleaning ones teeth Cleaning the teeth only lowers the bacterial count in the mouth and will help the healing of the tongue It is a wound just like any other Keeping it clean is best Not cleaning your mouth will only exacerbate the infection normal it needs to be opened up to drain boils are painful but the fluid inside is a liquid and bloody drainage use heat packs to help drain it staff comes with fevers and body pain flue like symptoms have been described by people and the drainage is thicker yellowish stuff now MRSA is fast spreading and it goes deep into tissue it makes huge pockets of thick puss and is hard at the touch like a mass it has a hard puss that comes out in big chunks it is very very painful and high fevers and severe flue symptoms it is deadly DR WILL NEED TO OPEN AND PACK WITH STERIAL GAUZE TO LET IT HEAL FROM THE INSIDE OUTAND WILL NEED A GOOD BROADBAND ANTIBIOTIC My wife and I

get a sinus infection Try also using breath right strips i found they helped relieved pressure during the night so I was able to taste somethings in the mornings Every 8 hours Ive had a few yeast infections that caused that discomfort which usually results from scratching or rubbing too much down there when it itches Some of the yeast infection medications also include a little tube of cream that is there specifically for the relief of the discomfort you are experiencing how do you get rid of a yeast infection It could be that you are in a premenopause state called peri menopause Your gyn could give you a prescription for progesterone to stop it for now It usually occurs in your 40s  50s See your doc Well the Scientific name of a fungal ear infection is Otomycosis which is most common in warm climates and usually contracted by those who participate in aquatic activities So its just another type of infection in the auditory canal that is not a bacterial or viral infection and is

products that relieve STDs are antibiotics such as arithromycin which is the top brand 5 years ago I was prescribed Doxycyline for acne and in recent years I realized it is a get out of jail free card with most STDs I am not sure if the medication you received is an antibiotic but most of the anitbiotics do cure STDs except herpes and warts if taken infrequently Hope this helps I would agree that only your doctor would be able to prescribe the right treatment I hope youve found help since October Also ask him or her if is useful Super Beta Prostate contains betasitosterol and many other essential nutrients I think you should see an ENT I suffered with sinus infections for many years with nosebleeds sinus pressure daily headaches facial pain congestion drainage etc I also tried anything you can buy OTC and prescriptions Last year I saw an ENT had a CT Scan and a few months later I had sinus surgery which included scrapingcleaning out my sinus cavities and correcting a deviatied septum Healing time was within what they consider a normal range and the pain was not as bad as I had expected it to be I had surgery in August and was allergy tested in December and recently began allergy shots It has been a long process but I am finally starting to feel better If you are going to see an ENT I would talk to friends family members people who can recommend one to you that they have seen and are happy with The practice I go to has a website entcarolinacom and they offer some helpful advice information on procedures testing etc i hope this helps good luck yea sound like you have a yeast infection id go get checked out girl Yea ive had it b4 its just that yeast infection just keep applying that cream till if fully goes away Are they around the head no most antibiotics they give for strep are Ammoxicilian ammoxicilian clavulanateAugmentin brand name cephalexin or Keflex brand name never heard of the drug you are speaking of I know you dont have insurance but think of your health I recently thought I was having an ear infection so went to doctor but did not want to pay high medical bill so went to clinic inside Walgreens and turns out it was only a skin infection of the outer ear was given cephalexin for 10 days since I can only take liquid meds have troubles taking pills I have insurance and ended up only paying 20 for the visit and 5 for the meds You should try Take Care clinic at Walgreens or MinuteClinic at CVS their prices seem to be very reasonable without insurance my visit would have been only 89 Im Not sure Ask your local pharmacy I am taking that now 250mg2tsp twice a day for 10 days I am taking this for cellulitis of the ear a skin infection Usually if you go to the doctor they prescribe your medication Might you be asking because you have some at home the antibiotic would be working by now despite not being the full 10 days yetmay be pneumonia which can get very bad very fasturgent care would be a good idea i have the same thing crackling sound in ears i think it to do with my jaw but how  same herre  what can i do to stop burning and itching nowno dischargeIt is on thr top of my vaginalI am 53help Each immunity and vaccine last for certain year in your body 20 year is max length if it is expired you need to renew it by getting a shot or be wary to avoid that disease so to answer your question your doctor is right Your ear buds may be irritating your ears It sounds like they are too big for your ears I had this problem growing up from my hearing aids The molds would be too big and hurt my ears Try headphones with the earpiece that goes over your ears not inside them You can still buy them this way It is healthier for your ears and your ear buds may even be contributing to your ear infections I would not recommend it I believe that it would irritate you more because you are actually sitting in whatever bacteria or dirt that you may have on you It is also better to use soaps or shower gels that are fragrance free Hope this helps I would Truly suggest to youYou have got to see a DrThis might be something seriousits Better to be Safe then to be SorryWishing you the best I also have swelling in my hands and feet any antibiotic can potentially cause a yeast infection you might want to phone your doctor to see what heshe suggests for the itchingpainburning there are quite a few over the counter creams for external use but because of being pregnant you should check with your OB before using them hope this helps In rare cases you can have oral thrush which is yeast overgrowth in the mouth Most commonly yeast can be found in the vagina and cause itching burning and clumpy excessive discharge The only way to know is to get tested If the sex worker was HIV positive then yes there is a chance since the condom slipped off and fluids were exchanged Dont wait get tested right away How to prevent mrsa Simple answer would be yes Increased temperature near the vaginal area can increase the risk for yeast infections If your worried about yeast infections due to heated seats do not use them IF its MRSA or worse than a big pimple then go see the doc  i had a boil on my knee at 9 yrs old couldnt bend my knee much or walk so FINALLY mom our doctor in the house LOLs got out the epsom salt in warm water on towel  put it on knee for a few hours then poked n drained it  did that again the next days  in a few days it quit hurting  cleared up win a week never had no more boils  whenever Id see any big pimple start to hurt Id pop it n drain it n put aloe vera or honey on it  drink more green tea  it goes away I dont know if it is related to diabetes but you can see your doctor for an oral medication like Diflucan generic Fluconazole The only time I get a yeast infection is when I have to take an antibiotic The doctor just prescribes this oral med to me along with the antibiotic This is the only thing that works for me Hope this helps  I have had both infections and only had itching with the yeast infection Any Discharge UTIs or Bladder infections feel more of an urgency to urinate and then you go and its just a few dribbles that causes discomfort However maybe its in the hair lice etc it will live in aLL hair and on surfaces Id have this checked out again and if your doctor still says everything is fine ask what you can do to alleviate the symptomsgood Luck that feeling is awful  as most women know at one time or another I dont believe so make sure you take antibiotics as prescribed and finish them Staph will come back and if you do not take antibiotics as prescribed and finish them you may end up with MRSA Good luck Antibiotics are great for getting rid of infections but they also get rid of good bacteria in your stomach Probiotics replace that good bacteria Even though I am not a doctor I took antibiotics for almost 2 years and it has helped me greatly to take a daily probiotic I am feeling good i would start off by saying 1 drink plenty of water  and two try as best as you can to pee after sex as this helps keep out things can can give you a uti yeast infections are due to the yeast that lives in you intestines  if you do anal sex try to not do it before vag sex and if possible wipe yourself when u go number two toward your back not toward your vag as this will help limit the contact of yeast to your vag hope this helps  also a healthy diet can help with utis i get them sometimes started after my son was born and i began drinking lots of water and for me i was able to stop it without meds  if you try this and it doesnt go away go to your doctor  if you have had children before they say it makes it more common to have utis  hope this helps  never heard f that before i would say its more likely to be the other way around if u have a abcess you should go to your dentist they can be life threatning if left untreated for a while the infection can go into your brain in short and cause your brain to shut down which ends in death your mouth most people dont think to take care of but remember its the closest thing to your brain  finish your meds by the doctor and go to the dentist its possible that the anti b they gave you wont help whats going on in your mouth they work on a different part of the body hope this helps No Dentist or Dr should do any major work on you if your are sick Thats very serious First off Antibiotics are not used to treat a yeast infection Actually for some women they can cause a yeast infection A yeast infection can be treated with an oral pill called Diflucan It has to be prescribed by a doctor I recommend going to the doctor Explain that you are a virgin and that you know it is not an STD The doctor should be able to go by the symptoms you describe and give you what is needed While you are there feel free to talk about a pelvic exam and what you should expect when you are ready to get one Good Luck As you have tried Diflucan tell your doctor that it doesnt work There are prescription creams for yeast infections they can give you that are stronger than the ones you get over the counter Also after sex try using cleansing wipes instead of just toliet paper after you urinate You can get flusable wipes at Walmart for a few dollars Also if you havent already have the doctor check your blood levels to make sure you dont have diabetes Women with diabetes are more prone to getting yeast infections Steriod cream is probably going to be your best bet Look up common childhood skin problem here on WebMD you may find a picture that you can relate to Hope it goes away quickly Your best bet is to go to the doctor for this one You are correct all of the over the counter stuff are creams for women However doctors can prescribe an anti fungal oral pill that can get rid of yeast infections The pills have been around for years and are so much easier than dealing with creams Its also good for men who accidently catch it from their ladies Good luck Will you please see a gynecologist I used to get strep once or twice a year I received the same treatment just about every time The antibiotics I received usually made me feel better about two to three days after consistent use Gone within a week ARE SINUS INFECTIONS CONTAGIOUS My sister had a kidney infection and when she urinated she would bleed So do you think this blood you see is coming from your unrinary tract and not your vagina I would call your doctor either way If the yeast infection is untreated it may lead to more serious kinds of skin disease so it is best to see a medical practitioner right away It is very important to get rid of all our skin problems like acne or unwanted tattoo You may check out wwwdisappearinginknyccom for a tattoo removal in NYC  shoulder pain problems shoulder pain problems I do have this symptoms occasionally with some serious pain in my gums and then it disappears I consulted my Doctor about this and he told me to that it could result from the medication I was taken to threat the sinus ailment Thanks no go to the hospital anything over 105 can cause brain damage yes it could be fungal Depending of what direction you have more confidence in get candida treatment like fluconazole and if you are circumsized use the creams like Canesten If you are not circumsized I would not recommend the creams as they shrink the foreskin and you will feel like a little boy again  but then the foreskin cracks and that really is painfull and impossible to keep clean If you go for the more natural approach gentle soaking and washing with a mild sollution of nice quality applecider vinegar will work like a miracle cure What Ive just found is that Loridtine taking daily for allergies is causing bladder issues thats another name for Claritin Its related Frequent high blood sugars feed yeast I usally wear cotton panties or go with none just to let it breathe Just keep it dry for the most part But when I had a really bad one last year my doctor told me a tip which was the total opposite of what I had been doing She told me to keep a cool damp washcloth over the area while sitting on the toliet after you go and also having an ice pack on the area while laying down It helped a lot and I hope that you are feeling better soon and maybe one of these ideas helped My wife is also suffering yeast infection just tried many methods Trust me do not take any medicine from doctors they will work but they will also do harm to your health And try some green and healty solution home remedies and i wish that finally your issues will gone source
