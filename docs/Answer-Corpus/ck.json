{"text": "I had same problem wneck Please go get Cat scan they blew it off cause I was too young to have Throat Cancer Well I just finished operation on inside of throat 29 treatments of chemotherapy and radiation for STAGE 4 THROAT CANCER FROM HPV Good luck It sounds like it could be a mild form of staff I had something similar and my doctor gave me pills But another doctor told me to take a bath in plain water and a cap of bleach and after about a week it went away Ive had stage 4 COPD for the last 9 years None of the medications Ive been given or treatments for this disease that Ive been given in all that time would adversely affect anyones breathing Worst case scenario would be that the treatment does nothing Was the head removed Thinkdid the front of the tick between its front legs have a drop of bloodliguid visible after removal Was the tick at all actively flailing its legstrying to move As opposed to a piece of you attached to it resembling a small blood blot and a highly active tick IF RECENTLY ATTACHED Hey dont worry This can be due to following reasons You dont like attending classes You are not interested in homework and dont understand in class So for this try to make yourself attentive in class when you start understanding you will automatically start doing HW as well as feel interested in classes Dont know Tell her to goto another doctor those are also symptoms of a heart attack Dont want to cause undue worry but I had those symptoms that was leading up to my heart attack Anaphylaxis develops rapidly within minutes to a few hours after exposure to a provoking trigger The quicker anaphylaxis develops usually the more severe the reaction Most cases of anaphylaxis are not life threatening but it can be fatal Anaphylaxis is a severe wholebody allergic reaction Chemicals are released from cells in the body when they are exposed to a trigger The trigger can be a variety of substances such as bee venom a medication or a food Anaphylaxis may begin with severe itching of the eyes or face and within minutes progress to more serious symptoms These symptoms may include difficulty breathing swallowing diarrhea hives abdominal pain and swelling underneath the skin angioedema Anaphylactic shock is the most severe form of anaphylaxis and causes low blood pressure and difficulty breathing The chemicals released as part of the allergic reaction cause blood vessels to dilate or swell Circulation and respiratory failure can occur The reaction may be fatal if emergency treatment is not given immediately Generally with treatment anaphylactic symptoms resolve However there can be a reoccurrence of symptoms that develops without another exposure to the trigger This second reaction has been reported to develop in up to 23 percent of initial anaphylactic episodes in adults The second reaction typically occurs within 8 to 10 hours after the initial symptoms have resolved although recurrences up to 72 hours later have been reported In extreme cases protracted anaphylaxis has occurred which lasts for hours days or even weeks Talk with your doctor about your symptoms and concerns Anaphylaxis is not always easily diagnosed because the symptoms are varied and can mimic other conditions Anaphylactic reactions typically occur when a trigger is reintroduced The body becomes sensitized to the trigger Since you have had reactions to medications and are restarting a medication you may want to take the first dose of the medication at your doctors office so that you can be monitored When it comes to anaphylaxis the smart thing to do is to be cautious and seek immediate attention To feel like you are dying at age 18 is very concerning You should definitely consult your family physician and possibly see a specialist Persistent symptoms after Lyme disease has been treated appropriately with antibiotics is a very controversial area We do know that longterm antibiotics do not help and are associated with serious complications We also know from recent studies that Lyme disease does not relapse but you can get reinfected The most common symptom of Lyme disease is a classical rash erythema migrans and patients who get this rash again have another infection not a relapse A small percentage of patients who are treated for Lyme disease 1020 develop persistent symptoms which may last for 6 months or more This syndrome is called Posttreatment Lyme Disease Syndrome PTLDS According to the most recent advice from the Centers for Disease Control CDC there are many fraudulent products claiming to treat chronic Lyme disease So be cautious and make sure you are not being treated by quacks Treatment by a physician associated with a University teaching hospital would be a good choice In addition to seeing your physician and making sure there is no other condition responsible for your symptoms the CDC recommends that you eat a healthy diet and get plenty of rest talk to a counselor and keep a diary of your activities and symptoms Pregnancy can be a scary time and all women worry about whether something they did might harm their baby The best advice is to never take any medication both over the counter and prescription during pregnancy without first discussing this with your doctor The first trimester is a time where the baby is developing and miscarriages happen A few studies have suggested that medicines like ibuprofen which is a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug NSAID can increase the risk of a miscarriage in the first trimester But other studies have failed to find a connection A recent study done at Vanderbilt though has good news This study looked at overthecounter NSAID use in pregnant women during the first six weeks of pregnancy and found that there was not an increased risk of miscarriage There are also concerns that NSAIDs can cause heart problems in the baby in the third trimester In general women should avoid medication use during pregnancy if possible and always talk to their doctor first Most experts think that acetaminophen Tylenol rather than an NSAID is a safer option for occasional pain relief during pregnancy My personal preference is heat It seems to be better for me than ice Some people get better relief from ice so I would suggest try them both and then use what works the best for you I get this too Its due to the high salturea level of your sweat Assuming it irritates your skin but the irritation is in areas like armpits and groin using a barrieranti chafing cream just mustnt be water soluble will reduce the irritation to the point you may not get a rash  Id go to the doctor She is probably allergic Although I dont known your medical history or possible other symptoms I highly recommend that you seek emergency treatment immediately As a matter of fact please and allow professional medical personnel to assess the cause of your pain You have everything to lose by delaying medical evaluation  Yes a heart attack may happen to individuals with a pacemaker Heart attacks typically occur when the heart muscle cannot obtain a sufficient amount of oxygen The lack of oxygen may cause the heart to beat faster and thus requiring even more oxygen The lack of oxygen and blockage of the heart usually by fats causes the heart to eventually flutter or vibrate until it eventually stops beating A pacemaker is programed to regulate the heart by sending out electrical pulsations to help the heart beat at regular intervals but will not necessarily prevent a heart attack In essence the pacemaker replaces the hearts electrical system but has no effect on blocked blood vessels Without the pacemaker some people would have a heart that beat too slowly to rapidly or irregularly arrhythmias A heart that beats too slowly too fast or irregularly may cause organ failure fatigue and even death  The first doctor to assess the condition should be your primary care physician The family doctor will be able to review the patients medical history and will have familiarity with your husbands overall health The diagnostic process for neck pain can involve different body systems The pain can be caused by nerve disorders muscle injuries and even some diseases such as infections The general practice doctor can evaluate the symptoms order diagnostic tests like blood work and xrays and determine what kind of specialist is needed Based on your husbands condition and preliminary tests results the primary care physician may start treatment before referring him to one of the following specialist Back and neck problems can become like a painful nightmare Since youve tried OTC medications coupled with heatice compresses without improvement it is time to see the Family Doctor If he cannot be seen within a day or two a visit to the local hospitals emergency room is justified I hope that your husbands condition improves quickly  You are correct in suspecting that the Paxil is no longer working at controlling your conditions Many of the SSRIs including Zoloft and Prozac have the same quality of no longer working after a period of therapeutic symptom improvement After several years of reliable benefit these SSRIs may even begin to heighten the anxiety symptoms I would not recommend taking Abilify It has been shown to have many serious sideeffects including affecting blood sugar results While I understand that you do not want to giveup on a drug that once was effective it is probably best to try another medicine It is unlikely that your knee surgery has any relationship with your stiff neck Stiff necks are most frequently a result of trauma in the form of moving suddenly in a jerky fashion The stiff neck may also be caused by haphazard sleeping positions or maintaining a general poor posture Treatment of a stiff neck may start with warm compresses massage of the affected area with over the counter muscle creams and liquids and the taking of analgesic medications If your neck remains stiff and painful after 72 hours following the recommended treatment a visit to your family doctor or the chiropractor is justified Yes it is possible that you had a heart attack Undiagnosed heart attacks happen frequently and can be serious Some studies suggest that up to 25 of all Myocardial Infarctions Heart Attacks are of the Silent Type where the heart is damaged by a lack of oxygen Women are especially prone to silent heart attacks This type of heart attack may present with symptoms less dramatic than those as described in the elephant sitting on my chest variety  With vague or even no symptoms occurring the heart attack may be overlooked and picked up later on EKG studies Some of the symptoms as you described happening two weeks ago fit with those seen in silent heart attack victims chest pain and weakness An acute myocardial infarction can lead to chronic heart failure where swelling of the ankles is a common symptom A second heart attack may occur bringing with it even more heart damage My suggestion is to notify your medical doctor of your chest pain and swollen feet and ankles Your current symptoms and the recent unsettling medical event deserve to be professionally assessed If you feel like you may be having a heart attack or cannot talk with your doctor soon then a visit to the hospital emergency room is justified Minutes save lives and you may not get a second chance With even a remote possibility of your having had a heart attack It is better to err on the side of caution and see a doctor  That Xanax medication prescribed to you back in 2011 should still be safe and effective A federal law was passed in 1979 requiring manufacturers of medications to assign product expiration dates This date was intended to provide the consumer with a time deadline that ensured full potency and drug safety Sometime after creating the 1979 law a study was reported to have occurred by the FDA in response to a US military quandary The government maintained and probably still does a large stockpile of expensive medications prescription and overthe counter types and had to dispose of and replace these drugs every few years The results of the study showed that 90 of the more than 100 drugs looked at were absolutely safe and effective for usage even after 15 years past their assigned expiration date Many pharmacologic experts believe that expired drugs are safe to take even those that expired some years ago Although the potency of a drug may decrease over time much of the original potency still remains intact even a decade after the expiration date With the possible exceptions of insulin liquid antibiotics and nitroglycerin most medications have long shelf lives just as the ones tested by the FDA for the military If the medication is stored in a dry cool and darkened container its potency and overall safety should remain for years beyond the stamped manufactures expiration date There are many anecdotal web accountings swearing that just about all medications are still safe and effective well beyond the expiration date stamped on their bottle or box Even my bottle of spring water that was purchased last week shows a stamp text indicating Best By 040816 I know that water is not the same as medication but Id drink that unopened bottle of water after 4816 and use the past expiration Xanax pills Id fully expect to experience no negative consequences I am not saying to stockpile medications for usage beyond their expiration dates Admittedly when possible it is a good practice to follow the manufacturers expiration date and throwout outdated medications But in a pinch using medications past their expiration dates for a brief period of time should not present a health danger It is also important to realize that at best these dates may be well intended but perhaps arbitrarily assigned without sufficient scientific testing The only chance that I see to save your husbands life is through the involuntary commitment process into a psychiatric facility The laws concerning involuntary commitment vary from state to state Essentially your husband will need to be professionally evaluated to ensure that due to his illness he is refusing treatment is unable to understand his need for treatment and if not treated immediately on an impatient basis is likely to deteriorate emotionally or physically causing self harm I would begin the process by phoning your local government and asking for help Most communities have mental health departments that should support the patient and their families during the time of a mental health crisis I wish you well as you deal with a very difficult situation I hope that youve already received the answers that youre seeking along with a large dose of positive resolutionI just saw your posting today the sixth day and wanted to offer my help I am not an expert in diagnosing medical conditions but do have an education and work history directed heavily in the medical sciences Additionally my daughter and soninlaw have been paramedics for over 15 years With that introduction here are my thoughts on your symptoms and blood studies 1 As you know  some of your symptoms can easily fit into more that one medical category Additionally your symptoms and out of range lab results are suggestive of irregularities that could be associated with various body organ abnormalities Some of these conditions are very serious while many others are much more palatable I am sure that at this point you just want an answer 2 My list of possible medical conditions include  Pyelonephritis  Diabetic Hypoglycemia  Pancreatitis  Miscarriage  Pelvic Inflammatory Disease  Stomach Cancer and  Diverticular Diseases of the Colon Please feel well soon  Whether the ER doctor prescribes medication for panic attacks varies according to their medical training their comfort level in treating anxiety type psychiatric disorders and their overall individual philosophy One study determined that 17 of patients reporting to a hospital emergency room were experiencing a panic attack Many time chest pains thought to be a heart attack signal upon ER arrival end up being a panic attack The doctor must assess the patient correctly diagnosis panic attack and make a determination if medication should be given to treat the condition When medication is determined to be the treatment option some choices may include IM injections andor pills including antianxiety drugs like alprazolam Several antidepressants such as paroxetine may also be considered Also available is a newer selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor group of medications such as Citalopram Brand name Celexa Fluoxetine Brand names Prozac Rapiflux Sarafem Selfemra Fluvoxamine maleate Brand name Luvox Paroxetine  Paroxetine mesylate Brand names Paxil Pexeva Sertraline Brand name Zoloft Also available are the older tricyclic drugs and monoamine oxidase inhibitors for treating panic disorder such as Amitriptyline Elavil Protriptyline Vivactil Desipramine Norpramin Nortriptyline Aventyl or Pamelor Trimipramine Surmontil Perphenazine Triavil Even though so many medications are available to treat panic attacks in the ER and many more come are in the works for being approved patients many times are not given any medication to treat the panic symptoms Its can be tough diagnosing an itchy body Hives are red itchy welts on the skin and may be caused by various allergic agents and even nervous conditions Treatment of hives is directed at removing the source of the offending source I had a generalized body itch took the same course of action as you and eventually broke down and was seen in a walkin medical clinic for professional help My symptoms were mostly limited to feeling itchy from head to toe with only a faint trace of a skin rash I though that I had considered all possible causes including bug bites and new products entering my body such as foods beverages soaps and medications I also noted that my wife who shared our common bed was free of the same symptoms Obviously I was not contagious In my situation the hives condition was caused by an oral antbiotic that I had already taken for 5 days Since I had previously taken this same anti biotic in the past without negative consequences and didnt immediately see a reaction to the current treatment regime I mistakenly excluded the antibiotic as my allergic source In my case I was given an injectable dose of corticosteroid prescribed Prednisone and directed to terminate the offending antbiotic In your case after 34 days without resolving the issue through hydro cortisone and antihistamines its probably time to see a doctor  Yes these medications are therapeutic options available to help in controlling feelings of anxiety Both of the medications mentioned in your question are used primary to treat anxiety They also have numerous offlabel not officially approved to treat uses Sometimes these medications are prescribed in conjunction with other drugs to treat seizure disorders But these medications also produce sedative effects and can become physiologically and psychologically addicting These meds may also just temporarily hide the symptom of fear instead of treating its true underlying cause I would prefer that you look for other methods to control your fear of having a seizure Fear is a nonbeneficial characteristic that needs to be treated and not masked Over the last decade new and exciting seizure medications and treatment advances have shown great promise There is Vagus Nerve Stimulation and surgical options for uncontrollable seizures Stress is a recognized trigger for producing convulsive episodes Dietary studies have also shown improvement of seizure disorders through a high fat diet a low carb diet with reduced calories and the ketogenic diet Here are some suggestions Pay attention to your triggers and attempt to avoid them Eliminate the thoughts of fear Bio feedback and talk therapy can help with overcoming your fear Join a seizure support group to hear success stories and what newer treatments actually work This will also provide you with a safe environment to express your feelings and receive feedback Maintain a journal detailing all seizure events the triggers that may have been present prior to the seizure times that medication is taken or dosages are delayed or missed Annotate your emotional state of mind throughout the day along with your intake of foods and beverages Periodically review your journal entries looking for patterns that bring about feelings of stress fear or actual convulsive events Always take your medication as directed Talk with your doctor about trying new medications and perhaps starting one of the antiseizure diets Having a seizure disorder can present challenges in experiencing overall joy Your concerns are legitimate and should not be discounted But having a seizure disorder needs to be fought with the best treatment options You deserve a good life where the fear of having a seizure does not control your life Of course you may be serviced at an urgent care clinic but I dont see that as being your best choice Urgent care center doctors see individuals for relatively uncomplicated matters that can be resolved in one visit Conditions such as colds viruses rashes minor injuries bruises cuts requiring stiches and infections are typical types of straight forward easily diagnosable cases that respond well to immediate treatment A migraine headache is a symptom of some other disorder within the body such as hormonal changes headneck injury alcohol consumption sexual activity eye conditions ears nose  throat disorders emotional stress ingesting certain foods and beverages environmental factors such as breathing polluted air and many other reasons There is also a relationship between family heredity as a predisposing factor seen in suffers with migraines I recommend that you begin your search for resolution by making an appointment with a migraine headache specialist Other doctors who may provide you with answers to your headaches include Neurologists Pain Management Specialists OBGYN Specialists Endocrinologists and Allergy Specialists The next task is to begin keeping a journal of all daily activates It should include times dates all physical and emotional events all foods and beverages consumed and of course headaches Note the start and end times for all headaches the quality of the headache What does it feel like your pain level 1  10 treatments attempted and your response to those treatments If the headaches cannot be reduced in their number of episodes or their intensity in a reasonable amount of time then going to a hospital emergency room or urgent care center is justified In the interim  take the medications as instructed maintain a quiet and dark environment during acute headache periods apply a facial ice packand or heat to the painful areas eat and drink nutritious meals and rest as needed Unfortunately migraine headaches are painful and may be difficult to diagnosis in the differential process of identifying the precipitating factors known triggers which are unique to the individual sufferer of a migraine headache Feel better soon  10K 20K is a big price range and although very expensive it could be the going rate depending on some variables There can be a big difference in medical procedure costs based upon the geographical area of the country the person who is doing the procedure the exact type of epidural procedure and the facility where the procedure will be preformed The costs are typically lower when preformed in a doctors office but that savings comes with additional risks for medical complications Of course large medical insurance carriers can negotiate the costs of procedures significantly lower to what is referred to as Usual  Customary Charges wherein a noninsured individual pays the highest rates I see a common range for the epidural procedure to be between 3000  7000 It is probably in your best interest to contact multiple providers for this procedure in your area and compare prices Some large hospitals make available as public information on their web site the average charge for most procedures According to  during a heart attack nausea can be a typical symptom This occurs because The primary justification for using electroshock therapy is to treat depression I worked in a large state mental hospital back in late 1960s Even though the procedure employed then might now be judged to have been crude I saw many cases of success For example I witnessed one man speak within days of treatment after having been silent for many years due to major depression In some psychiatric hospitals today depression treatment may still include ECT as an option Some patients even come in periodically throughout the year as an outpatient when they feel the signs of depression presenting themselves ECT is usually given as series of treatments Some studies report improvement in dementia patients treated with ECT in controlling depression I suspect that dementia can be treated with ECT if depression unresponsive to medication also exist It is also suspected that a diagnosis of dementia without coexisting depression cannot be justified as a viable treatment type The risk of employing ECT in a patient with dementia is that their cognitive abilities might be further damaged Even patients with normal cognitive abilities find that they may have lost some memory abilities relating to both recent and remote details of their life after receiving ECT The exact reasons for its success in positively affecting the mood of depressed individuals is not fully understood You should see a doctor specializing in Lyme Disease no matter how long ago that the rash was first observed If you have Lyme Disease It can be and still needs to be treated Over 300000 individuals per year are infected with Lyme Disease The condition requires antibiotic treatment to eliminate all bacteria in order to stop further bodily organ damage This bacteria will fester in the body forever until treated completely The Lyme Disease process may start out with a skin rash fatigue and fever and be dismissed as being somewhat annoying but not being worthy of medical intervention Some later stage symptoms of the condition include heart damage neurological defects arthritis and chronic fatigue syndrome Best wishes for your improved health  I am sorry for the suffering that Motor Neuron Disease is delivering to your father I am equally sorry for the stress that it has caused you and your family Watching your fathers quality of life deteriorate over a 45 year period must almost be unbearable Crafting an honest and complete answer to your question was especially difficult for me MND is a horrible disorder that may begin slowly but quickly picks up speed with its destructive disease advancement Motor Neuron Disease is progressive and leads to nearly complete paralysis and breathing distress Most cases of MND are due to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ALSL or Lou Gehrig Disease Currently the medication Riluzole is the only FDA approved drug used to treat MND Riluzole is hardly a silver bullet in the effort to treat MND Studies have shown some benefit of Riluzole to slow the disease process As you probably know the prognosis for MND is grim If you want to know the true devastating and shattering life expectancy projections for MND after its initial diagnosis please continue reading my answer My opinions First of all each life is unique and precious I believe that miracles are possible New treatment options for MND are being worked on Nobody can predict exactly how the published survival rates apply to your fathers disease With that said there is currently no cure for MND and treatment efforts usually turn to palliative measures Hospice care can be a key ingredient to ensuring patient comfort as the disease finalizes its assault on the muscles of the individual Here are the sad statistical survival rates for MND 1 in 5 will remain living after 5 years of its diagnosis 1 in 10 will remain living after 10 years of its initial diagnosis I recommend that you and your family talk with the physician treating your father with Riluzole Perhaps your father should also be part of that discussion The specialty of that doctor is not as important as their familiarity with your fathers case That individual can best assess your fathers future prognosis The tumor in the lumbar area is most likely unrelated to MND But the tumor should be assessed and recommendations made for its possible treatment You deserve honest answers to your questions and concerns May you and your family experience peace during this time of uncertainty It sounds like you may have stopped taking antidepression medications on your own Many people either feel better or experience side effects that prompt them to stop taking the medication Stopping of antdepressants needs to be medically supervised by tapering and weaning methods It may have taken as long as 6 weeks for the medicine to take effect in your blood stream it only stands to reason that a person cannot safely stop this treatment in a risky cold turkeylike fashion According to a WebMD article symptoms of Antidepressant Withdrawal may be serious Symptoms most often occur within three days of stopping the antidepressant They may be mild and go away within about two weeks or end up causing catastrophic problems WebMD reports that symptoms can include In rare cases in people who have bipolar disorder antidepressant withdrawal has been known to trigger mania Withdrawal from certain older types of antidepressants called MAOIs has also though rarely been reported to cause confusion and psychotic symptoms In conclusion abruptly stopping antdepressants may cause physical problems emotional turmoil set your recovery back further from where you first started and even result in experiencing suicidal ideations  I recommend that you seek medical attention for your withdrawal symptoms The first step to take should be to have a complete medical exam including blood studies and a medication reviewsometimes different doctors prescribe medications without knowledge of the other doctors prescribed medications Too much medication can influence your energy level and cause drowsiness Once you are found to be medically fit no cancer no heart or major organ problemsyou may move on to what I suspect is the cause of your fatigue that is your chronic physical pain and resultant depression Your next step may be to seek a referral to be seen by an orthopedic surgeon to receive appropriate treatment options for your neck back shoulders torn rotator cuff and torn ACL This one doctor along with a pain management specialist may be able to keep your pain level within an acceptable range without taking large doses of energy draining medications Finally continue with your counseling and seek methods to reduce stress in your life Stress causes emotional and physical problems Eat nutritious meals exercise as permitted by your physician and as tolerated take neighborhood walks to see nature animals and to interact with other people and get 8 hours of sleep each night My plan is not a magic bullet but it is different from what you are doing now Your current plan of action is leaving you in pain in a chronic sleepy state and joyless You deserve better  I have right bundle branch block and my physician not was not concerned He explained to me that if it had been a left bundle branch block that he may have done investigation beyond my EKG test According to my doctor the majority of cardiac work is completed on the left side My understanding is that a left bundle branch block may have little to no significance or its presence could indicate underlying cardiac disease Left bundle branch block is sometimes seen with Cardiac Enlargement Aortic Valve Disease and a host of other cardiac conditions Although most organs of the body work like a finely tuned orchestra irritable bowel syndrome and back problems more than likely are issues not related to a diagnosis of left bundle branch block the LBBB finding and recommend that you discuss it with your doctor and determine if further workup is needed Perhaps a referral to a competent cardiologist heart specialist is justified  I do not believe that you have a mental condition THC the active ingredient of marijuana has a metabolic 12 life of approximately 20 hours Some of the THC is stored in fat tissue and eventually released into the blood stream with elimination through the kidneys and processed as urine It can take the average person 2030 days or even longer to metabolize all of the THC The psychological and physiological effects of one marijuana joint may last 8 hours or longer Reflexes may remain impaired for 5 hours or longer even when the THC concentration is lowered Having flashback symptoms as you describe lasting 40 minutes may be unusual for you but may be typical for other people Much of stoned flashback episodes are individualized according to the person THC concentration exposure the frequency of usage body type whether you regularly or only infrequently smoke marijuana tolerance builds up to regular THC exposure and the overall health condition of the person Some individuals never experience flashbacks You may be experiencing the lingering effects of THC and are not mentally ill As you know your mind and body are in a state of arousal while under the influence of THC causing motor coordination emotional and behavioral changes Please be careful and do not over use this drug  Swollen neck lymph nodes may be the result of an infection inflammation cancer or viruses In your case it is suspected that your recent cold is the cause of the enlarged neck lymph node Treatment is dependent on the cause with bacterial infections possibly needing antibiotics a virus needing to run its course and cancers being attacked with multiple individualized treatments The link below will access a WebMd article on the topic of lymph nodes httpwwwwebmdcomatozguidesswollenlymphnodestopicoverviewwwparam1307921683 I meant to put tourettes not torrents Sorry How are you doing with your issue I feel like this is really rare and you probably would know by now if you have this PraderWilli Syndrome will give you an unsatisfiable craving for food if you are born with this you will have had this eating problem your whole life Could be pinch nerve in neck have a Nerve conductive test done ask doctor I have the same thing an thats what we found was pinch nerve in neck  Well you should bring her to the doctor I had a tick on my armpit once and the doctor was a big help he dug the whole tick out I had been having a similar problem for quite some time It got so bad that I finally went and saw a Chiropractor He gave me 1 suggestion and I tried it It worked for a couple of nights Lay flat on your back with 1 pillow under your head and pillows on both sides of you When that stopped working for me I was then seeing a Physical Therapist She suggested that I lay on my side whichever side was more comfortable with 1 pillow under my head a pillow between my legs a small towel roll between my waist and the bed and a body pillow behind my back I have been sleeping that way for over a month now and it has been amazing I fall asleep much quicker and then I sleep really well through the night I HAVE A PHOBIA OF BRIDGES AND BEING STUCK AT RED LIGHTS MY HEART STARTS TO RACE IF I AM NEARING ONE OR BOTH OF THE ABOVE THEN I FEEL AS IF I CANT BREATHE AND START TO FEEL TINGLY BECAUSE NOW I AM HYPERVENTILATING I FEEL AS IF I AM GOING TO DIE ONCE I LEARNED WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH ME I NOW KEEP A PAPER BAG IN ALL VEHICLES I WENT THROUGH MANY TESTS TO FIND OUT MY CURE WAS A FIVECENT PAPER BAG YES I DO TAKE XANAX NOW TO EDGE THE COMING OF ONE TO BACK OFF THERE ARE TIMES THOUGH ONE OF THESE ATTACKS WILL START BY ME ONLY WATCHING A MOVIE OR STAYING ON THE COMPUTER TOO LONG I RECENTLY HAD TO HELP A FRIEND WHO HAD HER FIRST PANIC ATTACK I GOT MY TRUSTY PAPER BAG AND SOOTHINGLY TALKED HER DOWN IT TOOK ABOUT 20 MINUTES OR SO WHEN SHE FINALLY CALMED DOWN SHE SAID I FELT AS IF I WERE GOING TO DIE I TOLD HER KEEP BAGS AROUND THAT IT IS ONLY YOU STRESSING OUT OVER SOMETHING AND YOU MAY FEEL AS IF YOU ARE GOING TO DIE BUT YOU WONT I AM WONDERING DOES SHE GET REALLY ANXIOUS BECAUSE SHE IS AROUND A LOT OF PEOPLE WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE AROUND THE TIME I LOST A SON TO SIDS I HAD PANIC ATTACKS QUITE OFTEN IN A CLASSROOM SETTING I WANTED TO BAIL OUT OF CLASS EVERY TIME I COULD TELL THAT OTHER STUDENTS WERE WATCHING ME PROBABLY THINKING I WAS CRAZY WHICH JUST STRESSED ME OUT MORE I PERSONALLY DO NOT WANT TO BE TOUCHED DURING ONE AND I WANT TO BE LEFT ALONE I SEEM TO HOLLER AT SOMEONE TRYING TO CALM ME DOWN IF YOUR FRIEND IS DIFFERENT THAN ME DONT TRY TO MAKE HER STAY IN CLASS THAT WILL JUST MAKE IT WORSE BUT I HAVE A FRIEND WHO RECENTLY HAD HER FIRST ATTACK AND I GAVE HER A PAPER BAG WHICH I KEEP

TELLING HER THAT SHE WILL BE OKAY IN A LITTLE BIT THAT THIS SPELL WILL SOON GO AWAY AND SHE WILL FEEL BETTER I HAVE JUST LEARNED FROM MD THAT HER HOT FLASHES MAY NOT BE THE CHANGE OF LIFE IT MAY BE THE ONSET OF A PANIC ATTACK Severe psychological events can potentially cause hallucinations but I think its rather uncommon for a panic attack to do so It would not be impossible however for you to have the panic attack first and the hallucination to begin afterwards Its possible that you simply noticed the visual disturbance the physical sensation of being afraid and that coming down from the panic left you physically or emotionally tired I would recommend that you tell someone if this happens again since a lot of other things can cause hallucinations Its possible that this was an isolated incident but it never hurts to be sure  My daughter has cat scratch fever wheb she was little it would start with a sore throat and the throat would get infected a huge knot of puss went from one side of her kneck to the other Finally had to take her to the hospital and an dr numb her kneck where the infection was at and lanced it to get the puss out the puss was the infection going from one side to the other so yes you need to see a dr soon as possible It can be treat with HT Hormone Therapy in which women need to opt for Birth control or oral contraception pills It is prescribed because they

subscribing different pills that dont work Any thoughts One may have the wrong strenght in their personaland or reading glasses Ive dealt with COPD issues with my grandmothers almost my whole life The only things I can think of that your body would adversely be affected by are steroids and oxygen If they put you on steroids for your lungs and you dont actually have COPD that is not a good thing they put my grandmother on prednisone which is a steroid anyway steroids like this can become an issue for you especially if you dont need them because your body becomes dependent on it Oxygen is also something that your body will become dependent on If they put you on a portable oxygen machine or if they had you put one in your home and you use it constantly your lungs will become dependent on that extra oxygen and after so long your body will not be able to go without it This happened to both of my grandmothers and they both claimed that they felt better before they got on the oxygen than they did with it because they couldnt do anything with out it Late night snacking is difficult for many people Before having a snack I always suggest that you first analyze whether youre actually hungry or just eating out of boredom Theres nothing wrong with late night eating as long as its a mindful deliberate snack instead of mindless eating Try not to eat too much food before you go to bed Your last full meal of the day should be no less than 2 hours before you go to sleep Eating too much before going to bed may cause indigestion acid reflux or could lead to insomnia and trouble sleeping Make sure that if you do snack that youre only eating at most between 100 to 300 calories shortly before going to bed For many people late night snacks often tend to not be very healthy Be sure to keep healthy alternatives readily accessible so that you can make the right choices Check out this article for some great low calorie snack ideas from a dietitian

article on electrolyte replacement at httpwwwe21comauelectrolytereplacement Firstly this is a problem to be solved by a team approach First see a derm and an endocrinologist They together will check for hormonal imbalances such as PCOS  PCOS polycystic ovarian disease which can result in excessive body hair and facial hair It can also be accompanied by cystic acne and weight gain There are many other causes of excess hair growth  Sometimes it is genetic or cause from certain medications Some ethnicities grow darker thicker hairs as well In general a routine blood test to look for PCOS and other abnormalities can lead to a simple treatment with a medication and as well laser hair removal Remember  please see an endocrinologist and a dermatologist as well as your gynecologist Stick with boardcertified physicians looked into getting MRI or seeing an Orthopedic specialist for a pinched Nerve or cervical Neck problems Had a Neck n 2 shoulder repairs I have been in pain just like yours since last Shoulder surgery n told possible SSN Super Scapular Nerve problems I would consult your doctor asap They may want to do a scope to look inside your throat for possible tumors What kind of pain is it Is it located in your throat itself or in the neck in general It sounds like you are having symptoms of GERD or acid reflux disease With your age and history and the length of your symptoms it is HIGHLY unlikely you are having a heart attack If you have a history of anxiety and heartburn it could very well turn into GERD I have acid reflux and the symptoms your describing coincide with GERD I find taking an extra strength Zantac 150 mg once every morning keeps me from experiencing any symptoms If that doesnt help or doesnt help ENOUGH you can always speak to your doctor There are proton inhibitors they can prescribe you that will work much better Proton inhibitors slow the production of stomach acid However if you are having any other symptoms or your current ones get worse I would definitely contact your doctor right away Deer ticks are a problem everywhere in the country so no matter where you live you do have to be careful about ticks And you should check yourself or anyone else in your family or anyone you are with from head to toe at the end of everyday to make sure that if any ticks are there they are removed as quickly as possible The safest way to avoid getting bit by a tick is to have physical coverage which would be long sleeve and long pants Some insect repellents are specifically for ticks but not all So you do need one that is specific for ticks in order to have that protection The other thing you have to be careful of is that sometimes sunscreen and mosquito or tick repellent can conflict So they may be less effective when used together There are products that are insect or tick repellent and sunscreen built in together but if you use them separately you may have to reapply your sunscreen more frequently Your insect repellent will be as effective or your tick repellent but not your sunscreen so you have to be careful that way You can use products developed for use on the face Look for ingredients such as retinoids retinol retinyl propionate and others peptides vitamin C niacinamide caffeine grape seed extract marine extract and other antioxidants There are excellent chemical peels or laser peels your dermatologist can offer you to help treat this very sensitive area My preference is the fractional CO2 laser It could be from sun exposure fragrance or any underlying even subtle irritation that causes inflammation of the skin can leave behind discoloration also known as hyperpigmentation There is also a type of yeast infection called tinea versicolor that can leave your neck back and upper arms looking blotchy Your dermatologist will be able to help clarify and offer you the proper treatment to clear the condition It could be psoriasis or a condition called seborrheic dermatitis Both are chronic conditions but have different underlying causes and somewhat different treatments You can start by using a salicylic acidbased wash and OTC hydrocortisone and a salicylic acid or tarbased shampoo If it does not improve your dermatologist will be able to evaluate and offer prescription treatments to better control the condition There are no treatments similar to Botox that last longer Botox does work very well in the right candidate to smooth neck bands but not for excess skin There are new radiofrequency and less invasive liposuctionlike devices that are coming in the next year or so that may work well for turkey necks but nothing beyond liposuction and plastic surgery for now There are no treatments similar to Botox that last longer Botox does work very well in the right candidate to smooth

extract and other antioxidants Has a Doctor verified you have an ear infection  I had HORRIBLE pain in my ear I went through 5 courses of antibiotics before the decision was made that I should see a Specialist The problem was not in my ear the glands in my neck were blocked and were pressing against my ear I had a huge bulge under my jaw from the infection I had surgery at MD Anderson Hospital almost a year ago and all is fine With a stroke we usually look for slurredgarbled speech onesided weakness or weakness in general but especially onesided confusion trouble walking numbness in the facearmleg again especially on one side confusiontrouble understanding people trouble seeing difficulty walking dizziness or a sudden severe headache There are certain key foods that really seem to keep you feeling satisfied for longer such as beans I find when I have a bean burrito for example even if its on the smaller side it really stays with me Another bean idea is edamame green soybeans just a bowl of these can really satisfy your hunger Basically foods with a lot of soluble fiber or protein andor water content help make this happen Beans are rich in all three Smart fats can keep the contents in the stomach a little longer too Foods with monounsaturated fat olive oil olives nuts and omega3s fish canola oil walnuts soy and pecans Here are some foods rich in soluble fiber Beans Oats Barley  look for soups with barley Some fruits apples mango plums kiwi pears blackberries strawberries raspberries peaches citrus fruits Some vegetables artichoke celery root sweet potato parsnip turnip acorn squash potato with skin Brussel sprouts cabbage green peas broccoli carrots cauliflower asparagus and beets One of the best pieces of advice for you though may be to drink some hot tea when you are feeling hungry again keep some liquid in your stomach and warm liquid tends to hang out in the stomach a little longer too Green tea is full of helpful phytochemicals so find some flavors you really enjoy tropical green or peppermint green tea etc Or warm up some broth or tomatobased soups as a midmeal snack People who have been abusing alcohol even for a short time can indeed experience serious side effects when they stop drinking Although a heart attack is unlikely an irregular heartbeat can develop along with seizures shakes sweating hallucinations and other serious conditions However a greater risk than quitting alcohol is continuing to abuse alcohol If your friend has an alcohol problem you should encourage him or her to seek medical treatment If your friend exhibits any of the signs of  as mentioned above you should seek immediate medical attention In particular delirium tremens DTs or the shakes can cause death in extreme cases and should not be ignored I wish you all the best I wish I could explain this but its impossible to know what happened without knowing the specifics involved Percocet generic name oxycodoneAPAP is an oral tablet taken by swallowing Usually postsurgical pain is treated with intravenous IV medication not pills Its possible your postsurgical blood pressure issues had nothing to do with the percocet Normally low blood pressure in the recovery room is treated with IV fluids I dont know what reversal drug you were given for the percocet Im going to assume you received naloxone brand name Narcan I dont know why this would cause you to feel as if you were having a heart attack I could speculate but that would be of no use If you are truly concerned about this I advise taking it up with the surgeon who performed your knee replacement surgery He should have access to the anesthesia and nursing records that show exactly what medications you were given the times they were given and the dosages you received Perhaps your surgeon could shed some light on what happened Wishing you well Great question Im glad you asked because many others will benefit You should be just fine taking this combination of medications You may feel drowsier than normal And anyone who is taking a narcotic hydrocodone should either not drive or else be very cautious when driving because driving under the influence of narcotics is prohibited in many states and local jurisdictions In general though youre not at high risk from taking this combination of meds at these dosages In the future Id recommend you ask your health care provider about possible drug interactions at the time youre prescribed a narcotic Also you can always consult a pharmacist for advice I hope your ankle heals quickly Please do not go off your Zoloft generic name  without consulting your doctor Stopping an antidepressant abruptly can cause serious side effects including suicidal thoughts If you feel the sertraline isnt working your doctor can recommend a different medication for you Its not uncommon to try several medications before finding the right ones to treat anxiety and depression If you feel you no longer need an antidepressant please discuss the situation with your health care provider He or she can tell you how to safely go off the sertraline and can monitor your progress This way if you experience any side effects your physician knows whats going on Hope this helps Thank you for reaching out with this question Its an important one for others your age who have your symptoms My advice Check with your doctor before doing any exercise at all even walking for exercise He or she can give you specific instructions for what type of exercises to do for how long and at what intensity If you decide to walk anyway hey I know how you 86 year olds are please have someone with you at all times Because of your weakness I have a real concern about your falling and breaking a hip Right now you may need to focus more on diet than on exercising especially since you say you feel extremely weak I salute you for being a survivor and wish you many more healthful years You inspire me The key phrase in your question is this I was playing video games at the time Since the numbness is confined to the tip of your thumb chances are youre suffering from a repetitive motion injury Any activity that involves the same movement of the hands and fingers over and over again can cause irritation of the nerves that supply them In the extreme this can cause loss of movement and severe pain In your case it sounds like you may have irritated a nerve that carries sensory impulses to the brain That tiny nerve ending apparently has stopped working The good news is if this is indeed a repetitve motion injury you can improve the situation by resting your hand for awhile Avoid playing any video games and see if the situation improves If not see your health care provider for further evaluation Just to be clear the in men generally include a crushing or squeezing sensation in the middle of the chest chest pain pain or numbness radiating down the left arm andor into the left jaw shortness of breath faintness or nausea And dont think just because youre only 19 years old that a heart attack would be out of the question While its unlikely a heart attack can strike people of almost any age particularly if theyre sedentary andor overweight Great question However in this case two different issues are being confused calorie intake versus a diabetic diet Whether or not you have diabetes your calorie needs depend on your current weight activity level and desired ideal weight If you need to lose weight you should eat fewer calories per day The example you cited above contains about 1540 calories This is a diet for someone who wants to lose weight To give you an example a female who is 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighs 150 pounds requires about 1700 calories per day to maintain that weight even if she gets little to no activity during the day A man who is 6 feet tall and weighs 180 pounds would require many more calories per day even with no exercise involved Many people with doindeed need to lose weight You should consult your health care provider or a certified diabetes educator for guidelines on calorie intake Eating to maintain blood sugar glucose levels throughout the day doesnt really revolve around the number of calories consumed Maintaining healthy blood sugar levels is more about the types of foods you eat A good diet for diabetes should be balanced with whole grains no refined grains vegetables fruits protein and healthy fats such as olive oil or canola oil This for Type 2 diabetes from WebMD offers ideas about the of food you should eat but the calories in this meal plan may or may not be adequate for your sex height and current weight If you have questions about how to eat healthy to control or reverse with Type 2 your diabetes consult your health care provider or a certified diabetes educator Best wishes to you Yes they can In fact people experiencing their first anxiety attack often believe theyre having a heart attack Symptoms of the two conditions are very similar If youve never had an anxiety or panic attack before and therefore have not experienced the symptoms you should always err on the side of caution and seek emergency medical attention Granted a heart attack in a younger person would be quite rare but as the old adage goes Better safe than sorry Once youve had a panic attack you can recognize the symptoms of it when it occurs However no one should attempt to selfdiagnose a heart attack versus a panic attack If youre not sure always call for emergency responders Keep in mind the symptoms of a heart attack can go away on their own If youve experienced symptoms you believed were a heart attack but then cleared up do not assume you had a panic attack instead You need to get checked out by a health care professional Wishing you well Honestly the only way to diagnose strep is through a lab test Even if all the signs like throat redness and symptoms like soreness are there it still may not be strep Even white spots in the back of the mouth are no guarantee its a case of strep is almost always accompanied by fever Are you using a thermometer to measure your sons temperature or are you relying on the old handtotheforehead method Its very important to use a thermometer when assessing fever I mention this because it never ceases to amaze me how many people do not have this basic tool in their medicine cabinets Keep in mind also if youre giving your son acetaminophen Tylenol to ease the pain of the sore throat this could cause him to register a normal temperature on the thermometer because acetaminophen is a feverreducer Instead of speculating about what might be going on with your son I suggest you take him to his pediatrician Since the problem has been going on for nearly a week its not a bad idea to get medical attention I hope your little boy feels better soon Wishing you well Im sorry you experience this It doesnt sound pleasant thats for sure Whenever a patient describes pain with words like jolt of electricity we tend to think in terms of nerve pain Only a physical examination and perhaps some testing like Xrays or MRI can say for sure whats going on with your neck That said I would suspect you occasionally pinch a nerve when you turn your head suddenly This type of can occur if you have a spinal disc that is slowly collapsing or if you have some arthritis in the vertebrae spinal bones of your neck While I dont think this situation is an emergency I would suggest you get this checked out by a health care provider soon Catching spine problems early usually results in a better outcome You can start with a visit to your primary care provider and he or she can get the ball rolling Hope this helps Im sorry youre going through this Pain is never fun I would urge you to get in to see your doctor as soon as possible What youre describing does not sound like a migraine at all but it could possibly be an ear infection In rare cases an untreated ear infection can move into the bone behind the ear This normally happens in children and is called  No matter what the underlying cause of this pain is the fact its ongoing and seems to be getting worse means you need medical attention If you cant get an office visit its probably time for a visit to urgent care Feel better The short answer to your question is no is not labeled for anxiety or panic attacks Bupropion is used to treat depression Sometimes it is also used to treat seasonal affective disorder SAD and to help people stop smoking According to WellbutrinSRs label Tell the doctor immediately if you notice new or worsening depressionother psychiatric conditions unusual behavior changes including possible suicidal thoughtsattempts or other mentalmood changes including newworsening   trouble sleeping irritability hostileangry feelings impulsive actions severe restlessness very rapid speech If you are taking bupropion and are experiencing a panic attack I suggest you seek medical attention as soon as possible Its not a good idea to stop Wellbutrin bupropion suddenly If you are experiencing side effects you feel you cannot tolerate youd be well advised to speak to a health care provider about other medications you can take instead Best wishes to you Im sorry youre going through this It sounds very unpleasant A number of things could be going on here but its not likely your gallbladder is involved The gallbladder is located on the right side of the body near the bottom of your rib cage Its doubtful the gallbladder could refer any pain to the left shoulder I can think of any number of reasons youd be having this pain from a slight fracture to a injury to an aggravated  The only way to find out whats going on is to see a medical professional for an examination and possibly other testing like an Xray Id suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider PCP to have this evaluated It would be helpful to evaluate it when its actually flaring up but that might be impossible to time Even if youre not having a pain episode your PCP might be able to come to some conclusion as to the cause of this pain and get you started on treatment Best of luck to you If the situation concerns you the best bet is to call your primary care provider or if you feel the situation is lifethreatening call 911 Since you said this same thing happened the last two times she received steroid injections to the neck it sounds as if this may be her bodys normal way of reacting to the injection However any time you become worried or frightened about a persons or your own reaction to a medical procedure its a good idea to seek medical attention I hope you find this response helpful Im sorry to hear youre suffering like this Its bad enough to take on a new job without then coming down with mysterious physical symptoms Unfortunately its impossible to tell whether this is serious or not Obviously you should know the and also know the  While anyone can have a heart attack its more likely among people with multiple risk factors I would suggest you make an appointment with your primary health care provider to evaluate your symptoms Your provider probably will want to run some tests such as blood work or possibly and EKG Many medical conditions could cause the symptoms you describe including low thyroid Your health care provider can correlate your health history with your new symptoms to arrive at a diagnosis I hope you feel better soon Im sorry youre going through this and that the medications didnt give you any relief When symtpoms persist after treatment its always a good idea to return to the doctor to update him or her and get reevaluated Id suggest you do just that Tinea barbae is a type of  which is an inflammation of the hair follicle the part of the hair thats embedded in your skin caused by an infection Tinea barbae is caused by a fungus which is why your health care provider prescribed an antifungal cream clotrimazole to treat it However since that didnt work its time to get the rash rechecked Id suggest you also share with your doctor that overthecounter lotions and creams made the rash worse If possible tell him or her specifically which items you used That may help get you a better diagnosis Good luck to you Im sorry your mom is going through this It sounds like a very uncomfortable situation If its been less than a week since your mom saw the doctor then you may just need to hang in there awhile longer The symptoms you describe could be caused by many conditions including a cold virus You may need to take a watchful waiting approach to see if the situation gets better or worse If it gets better then great If it gets worse Id suggest a return trip to the doctor Keep in mind Im just making suggestions I am not in a position to suggest a diagnosis or give medical advice Hope your mom feels better soon Im sorry to hear your daughters going through this Test anxiety can be a miserable experience usually occur with several specific physical symptoms such as dizziness shortness of breath andor a pounding or racing heart beat If your daughter is experiencing any of these symptoms shed do well to get checked out by a health care professional Panic disorders and panic attacks are not uncommon and usually can be treated with medication or a combination of medication and talk therapy If your daughter only experiences anxiety during test taking its possible she suffers from test anxiety which is considered a symptom of  and is very common Who among us hasnt felt those sweaty palms as we sat down to take an exam Again it would be worth getting checked out by a health care provider because social anxiety also can be treated Most college campuses have a student health center That would be a good starting point for your daughter to help her figure out whats going on Best wishes to you both Good question I guess Im assuming youre the one with and that you have had this diagnosis confirmed by a doctor If not and you suspect you have in your neck obviously you need to see a doctor as soon as possible because the situation could be very dangerous Bones are very good at repairing themselves In fact bones are constantly remodeling their structure replacing old cells with new ones The type of treatment for a bone fracture depends on the location and severity of the break For example a simple broken arm may be treated only with stabilization a cast while the bone mends itself On the other hand a severe fracture of bones in the ankle may require surgery with the use of screws and plates to hold the bone fragments together Like I said if you suspect you have a broken bone in your neck from an injury you need to seek medical attention A doctor will advise you on what treatment is required if any for the situation Best wishes to you You raise some good questions In fact theyre good questions to take up with your doctor You have a right to have all your questions answered before beginning any medication therapy Id suggest you call your doctor or make an appointment to go over your concerns about the Abilify prescription That said Im also confident your doctor wouldnt prescribe a drug combination he or she believed to be unsafe However its never a bad idea to doublecheck and go over your complete list of current medications because doctors today are overworked and its easy to overlook something Hope this helps Im sorry youre experiencing this Medical diagnosis and treatment can be very confusing sometimes Certainly in the neck cervical vertebrae can cause pain The pain is caused by pressure on the nerve roots where they extend from the spinal cord and through the vertebrae If the discs in your neck are degenerating becoming stiff or even collapsing this can put pressure on the nerves and cause pain Sometimes a doctor will look at pictures of your neck from an Xray or MRI and will not see any areas of nerve compression Because of this he or she will tell you you shouldnt be having any pain However its not always possible to see a compressed nerve on an Xray or MRI If youre having pain in your neck you can return to your doctor to let him or her know this Your doctor will determine what type of treatment might work best to relieve your symptoms I hope you find relief soon The type of flushing you describe after drinking alcohol is not necessarily unusual Alcohol consumption causes veins to dilate get larger which can cause the skin to appear reddened This venous dilation also is the cause of the warm feeling many people associate with moderate drinking Absent any other symptoms you probably need not worry about this bit of flushing caused by consuming a moderate amount of alcohol Note however if you take any prescription medications you should consult your health care provider or a pharmacist before consuming alcohol in any amount Alcohol can affect medications in many different ways so if you are drinking even wine or beer you want to make sure its safe for you Wishing you well The short answer to your question is yes the hydrocodone could possibly be contributing to your husbands sleeplessness Id suggest he go back to his health care provider and discuss his medications again to determine if this is the case Hydrocodone is an  Usually opiod medications depress certain central nervous system functions such as breathing Typical side effects of opioid medications include sleepiness However a few people might experience whats called a paradoxical reaction to an opioid pain reliever This means their body responds in an opposite fashion to the drug So instead of becoming sleepy from taking an opioid for example a person could become stimulated instead Its not possible to diagnose a paradoxical reaction through a forum like this Only your husbands health care provider can determine if this is happening with your spouse Your husband should not stop taking the hydrocodone abruptly because this can have unpleasant side effects Instead hed be wellserved to see his health care provider as soon possible to reevaluate his medications Sorry youre going through this I hope it gets resolved quickly Well no not exactly TIA stands for   It refers to a moment in time when a portion of the brain is temporarily denied oxygen ischemic usually because of a blood clot in a tiny artery within the brain tissue itself TIAs are sometimes called ministrokes because they arrive with the same signs and symptoms as a full stroke but those symptoms then disappear transient Thats not to say anyone exhibiting the should wait to see if those signs go away Anyone who has any of these symptoms should seek emergency medical treatment Sudden weakness or paralysis on one side of the body Sudden loss of speech or the ability to understand speech Lopsided smile for no reason Sudden dizziness loss of balance or falling Sudden dimness of vision especially if its only in one eye But back to your question The underlying cause of a TIA usually is a blood clot Many things can cause a person to get a blood clot that travels to the brain and some of those things can be inherited Its not likely but its possible However you cannot inherit TIAs because theyre not a disease TIAs are a condition caused by something else in this case a blood clot The best way to avoid TIAs or stroke is to eat a hearthealthy diet and exercise regularly Nothing can protect you 100 against stroke but you can tilt the odds in your favor by staying healthy If you have questions about your risk of stroke please talk to your primary care provider or physician He or she is in the best position to evaluate your personal risk of stroke in the future Wishing you well Im sorry youre having these episodes of nervousness Based on your description they dont exactly sound like a  which is typically very dramatic and involves a racing heart shortness of breath and sometimes even chest pain You say youre taking a course in group counseling Presumably this is under the direction of a teacher If you feel you can confide in your instructor why not get his or her take on the symptoms youre describing They may be perfectly normal Or perhaps you could discuss your symptoms with the group therapy leader Again he or she might be able to help you understand whats going on and how to overcome it You also could consider seeing a private therapist about this If youre a college student you may be able to take advantage of a student behavioral health center I wish you all the best Im sorry youre going through this It sounds absolutely miserable Because this situation is now going on three weeks I would suggest you get it checked out You may be able to avoid the emergency room and the high fees involved by searching in your community for a free or lowcost health care clinic Sometimes these have the name healthcare for the homeless but you usually dont have to be homeless to take advantage of the services I cannot provide a hotlink here but if you visit httpwwwhrsagovgethealthcareaffordableindexhtml you can search for lowcost health care in your area I wish you all the best with this Im glad to hear all is good and I hope I can help set your mind at ease A in the neck can send pain radiating down the shoulder and arm  and even into the chest area which could indeed feel like the symptoms of a  Presumably you received an Xray or MRI scan of your neck This is usually how a pinched nerve in the neck is diagnosed Pinched nerves in the neck are often caused by compression of a disk in the spinal column of the neck This compression puts pressure on the nerve which in turn causes the pain Youre right that theres no relationship between a pinched nerve in the neck and a heart problem Its just that the pinched nerve caused you to have pain that was similar to what a person feels when they have a heart attack Hope this helps So sorry to hear youre going through this Its difficult to cope with severe pain Unless youre experiencing along with this pain in your neck please do not clog up the emergency room The emergency department should be reserved for true lifeordeath emergencies or serious traumas like broken bones Unfortunately severe neck pain doesnt rise to that level What youre describing sounds like the classic symptom of a  There are many possible causes for  ranging from a to a  It sounds like youve done everything right in terms of home treatment However one round of ibuprofen one hot shower and one good massage may not be enough to alleviate the pain especially if its caused by something like a herniated disk Also note No one should take more than 2400 milligrams of ibuprofen within a 24hour period and no more than 800mg every 8 hours Again assuming youre not exhibiting any which generally dont include stabbing pain at the base of the neck your best bet is to continue to try home remedies If the situation doesnt clear up within a few days make an appointment with your primary health care provider for an evaluation If the situation gets worse such as your arm starts to go numb then you might consider heading for an urgent care facility Wishing you well Unfortunately your question is lacking crucial information to provide a good answer How old is your son Has he received routine childhood vaccines Enlarged lymph nodes can signal a variety of potential conditions Your best bet is to take your son to his pediatrician for an exam If your son has not been immunized against the MMR vaccine you definitely should seek medical attention Mumps in a young man generally older than age 10 can cause a related condition called  which is swelling of the testicles This can cause fertility problems down the road Regardless of your sons immunization status having enlarged lymph nodes is not normal and you should seek medical attention If your son is running a high fever you should seek emergency medical treatment Wishing you well Im sorry to hear youre going through this generic name hydrocodoneacetaminophen shouldnt cause your blood pressure to spike Quite the opposite in fact Pain can cause your blood pressure to go up though so be sure to take enough medication to keep your pain adequately controlled Several things can cause your blood pressure to spike temporarily including needing to urinate pee However if your postoperative pressure is above whats normal for you please call your surgeons office to advise them about whats going on They need to know I wish you all the best with this This is a very good question Thank you for asking it Many people visualize a heart attack the way Hollywood portrays it A person suddenly clutches his chest and falls unconscious to the floor That sometimes happens but often and symptoms are more subtle The signs and symptoms of a heart attack include Pain or discomfort in the chest This can include feelings described as aching crushing squeezing painful pressure or some other word for discomfort Pain or discomfort that radiates into the jaw or arm area Pain or discomfort in the midback area Women experience this more often than men The back discomfort may feel like a muscle spasm that wont go away Sudden shortness of breath Sweating Anxiety Nausea or vomiting Fainting Heart attacks are caused by loss of oxygen flow to the heart muscle This can be caused by a blocked artery Its important to note the chest pain that normally accompanies a heart attack may clear up within a few minutes This does not mean you should not get emergency medical treatment It does not mean your possible heart attack has gone away Very often people have small heart attacks several times before a big one hits them If you or a loved one have any signs or symptoms of a heart attack even if they clear up within a short period of time you should seek medical attention Wishing you well Im sorry youre going through this I want to caution you however that you should never selfadminister antibiotics Its this type of usage that is causing a rise in the development of antibioticresistant bacteria Your best bet is to see a medical professional Your condition can only be diagnosed through a physical exam and possibly some other testing such as a throat swab or blood work It could as you speculate be a virus If it is it should clear up in 714 days No antibiotics required However it could be something other than a virus Many conditions can cause the symptoms youre describing from an inflamed salivary gland to an abscessed tooth The only way to find out is to visit a health care provider I wish you all the best Because you already have been diagnosed with  Id suggest you contact your primary health care provider to inform him or her of this new symptom And in answer to your question yes this is a new symptom It may be related to the MS or it may be caused by something else Only your health care provider can tell you for sure Wishing you all the best Im sorry to hear youre going through this It just goes to show how negatively pain can impact so many aspects of our lives I commend you for being committed to your sexual health and marital relationship Youre a good wife for wanting to build that intimacy back up Id suggest you start by assessing what nonsexual positions are the most comfortable for you For example if sitting in a chair provides relief try adapting that for a sexual purpose Have your husband sit on a chair and then sit on your husband if that makes sense Another suggestion is to try having sex in a water environment such as the shower or a bathtub This may be especially helpful if warm water gives you pain relief Just be careful nobody slips You may simply have to experiment to find positions that work for you Do not be shy about seeking out aids such as swings or slings that suspend from the ceiling if you need something like that to help take pressure off your back during sex A less expensive and less permanent solution may involve plenty of pillows to prop and support body parts Again experimentation is going to be key here If you feel shy about expressing your feelings or needs to your partner please dont hesitate to consult your doctor a nurse or a psychotherapist whos experienced in sexual health to help with communication and to help you find solutions Believe me they will understand your concerns and treat you with utmost respect All the best to you Well I recommend you get this checked out Heart problems can hit like lightning heart attack or come on gradually It sounds like you may have a heart problem thats becoming gradually worse Of course this can only be determined with a physical examination and some other testing performed by your health care provider Chest pain that lasts 8 hours is nothing to ignore Please get medical attention as soon as you can All the best to you Gosh its really hard to say what could be causing this without performing a physical examination Have you injured the shoulder Slept on it wrong Do you engage in contact sports Any of these things could cause the symptoms you describe It could be a pulled muscle muscle spasms shoulder injury nerve root compression at the spine  and thats just for starters Id suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider to have this checked out With a good physical exam and possibly some other testing your provider should be able to diagnose and treat the source of the symptoms Hope you feel better soon Im confused If the MRI showed bilateral  why would you believe thats not the cause of your symptoms Mastoiditis is an infection of the skull bone that lies just behind the ear It normally is treated with oral antibiotics because its a bacterial infection Ear drops also are frequently used If you have any questions about your diagnosis or treatment you should call your health care providers office for a call back or to make an appointment to see your doctor Best wishes to you Im sorry youre going through this and hope you have sought medical treatment Unfortunately its impossible to diagnose a condition like this without a physical exam Many conditions can cause the symptoms you describe A medical professional needs to see this and possibly run some additional tests in order to figure out whats going on Meanwhile be extremely careful not to touch surfaces or other people while the rash on your hands is active Wear light gloves if possible to keep from spreading whatever this may be to others I hope you get a diagnosis and feel better soon You are a good person to want to help your friend with her condition It can be hard to help someone in the moment of a panic attack One thing you can do is offer to hold her hand and breathe together Before attempting this you should practice slow deep breathing on your own so that in the moment of the panic attack you can help your friend regulate her breathing Dont get frustrated if she is unable to breathe as slowly as you are Merely staying calm and encouraging her softly to breathe in23 and breathe out23 can be helpful You may actually be able to help your friend better by finding an activity such as yoga that the two of you can do together when shes not having a panic attack Regular exercise can help anxiety in general and yoga specifically focuses on breathing By offering to do yoga with your friend youre supporting her in fighting the anxiety problem Your friend should be grateful she has you in her life Good luck to both of you Im sorry to hear youre going through this Foot pain can make it unbearably hard to get around Your case study is very interesting Ive never heard of foot pain related to heart issues But since youve been through this before Id suggest you listen to that inner voice thats telling you your foot pain may be related to some new development with your heart and make an appointment with your cardiologist to evaluate the situation With luck this symptom wont turn out to be related to your heart But if it is at least youll have caught it early All the best to you I suppose its possible can be very painful and Im sure it might feel as if the pain is radiating down the neck to the shoulder However the pain youre describing could be caused by many other conditions including muscle strain  or even possibly  The only way to tell whats causing your pain is for you to get an examination by a medical professional If your pain doesnt clear up or if its accompanied by a fever Id suggest you contact your primary health care provider for an appointment to find out whats going on Hope this helps You dont say if you have Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes and it makes something of a difference If you take insulin to control your diabetes you could be experiencing either the dawn phenomenon or the  Its important to determine whats causing your elevated though not outrageously I might add blood sugars in the morning While the dawn phenomenon is a natural occurrence the Somogyi Effect can be a result of eating too little of a bedtime snack Before you change your presleep eating habits you should consult with your doctor to discover if the problem is a result of eating or of poor insulin timing If you dont take insulin to control your diabetes then Id recommend you eat a proteinrich snack before bedtime Good choices include natural peanut butter without added sugar either by itself or on wholegrain crackers some lowfat or partskim string cheese with a small apple or lean meat such as turkey breast either by itself or with a slice of wholegrain bread If you have any questions about controlling your sugars please consult your primary care provider or a certified diabetes educator Best to you Im sorry to hear youre going through this The fear of having cancer must be very tough for you to cope with Im glad to hear you have a mammogram scheduled That is a good starting point and it sounds like your health care provider is on top of your situation While you wait try to remember that worrying will only cause you misery and can even have a negative impact on your immune system Look for support from family and friends Try to distract yourself Focus on the many positive things in your life no matter how small they may seem If you can try to get a massage or otherwise pamper yourself to relieve your excessive stress Even though you have a family history of cancer its not a sure bet you have cancer too Its entirely possible your breast lump is benign noncancerous and that your other symptoms can be attributed to a virus or even stress I know its hard but try to work on reducing your stress level and staying as healthy as possible as you work through the process of getting a diagnosis Take care of yourself Im sorry to hear you go through this and if it helps Ill share this It happens to me too Some people are just naturally prone to flushing when theyre embarrassed angry or otherwise experiencing heightened emotions Have you ever noticed whether or not your neck flushes for no reason at all Mine does Sometimes I can just be sitting around minding my own business get up to go to the bathroom and notice my necks all red What the heck I dont know if theres any medical explanation for this Ive noticed personally that it seems to happen more in fairskinned people of north European descent It could simply be that flushing which is caused by increased blood flow just beneath the skin is more visible in fairskinned people I dont know If possible try to learn to live with this unique trait When people tease me about this I laugh right along with them I say things like Some people wear their heart on their sleeve I wear my emotions on my face If the anxiety aspect bothers you dont hesitate to seek counseling from a trained psychotherapist Anxiety can be managed through cognitive therapy talk therapy and medication if warranted A counselor also can help you cope with the embarrassment you feel about the flushing I wish you all the best as a kindred spirit Sorry youre going through this misery First lets not jump to the conclusion this is  though it certainly sounds like it could be Id suggest you see a medical professional for an accurate diagnosis As you know if it is shingles you may be able to take a prescription medication to help with the pain If its not shingles your health care provider may be able to provide you with treatment for whatever it actually is Try to refrain from pulling your hair out as this can cause permanent loss of hair in those areas Also remember shingles in the blister stage is contagious and can cause someone whos never had to come down with the illness To help avoid this make sure youre washing your hands thoroughly and often Also do not share any combs brushes or other personal hygiene implements I hope you get a diagnosis quickly I certainly understand her reluctance to seek medical attention when she doesnt have insurance Many communities offer free or lowcost clinics to people who are uninsured Maybe you can help her find one of these I think your daughter needs to get this checked out It may be completely benign such as a lipoma a fatty noncancerous tumor But then again it could be something more serious Certainly if your daughter has a fever or is experiencing unintended weight loss she needs to be checked out as soon as possible You might encourage your daughter also by reminding her the cost of an office visit is substantially less than the cost of an emergency room visit so why put off getting this thing looked at I wish your daughter all the best Im sorry to hear about your auto accident You obviously were lucky to survive The chest pain you describe could simply be caused by the rib fracture Ribs can take a very long time to heal A month isnt very long in terms of a rib fracture If the chest pain has gotten worse since your accident or if its accompanied by a fever over 101F racing heartbeat or shortness of breath then Id suggest you see your primary healthcare provider immediately or go to the emergency room These symptoms can be signs of an infection or a blood clot I hope this helps and wish you all the best in your recovery Whether or not you have insurance if you are experiencing any of these symptoms you must go to the emergency room immediately A crushing squeezing or burning pain pressure or fullness in the center of the chest The pain may radiate to the neck one or both arms the shoulders or the jaw The chest discomfort lasts more than a few minutes It can diminish in intensity and return Shortness of breath dizziness Nausea heartburn or upset stomach Sweating or feeling the chills A weak fast pulse An irregular heart beat Cold clammy skin or a gray color to the face Fainting or loss of consciousness Fatigue These are the symptoms of a heart attack  My purpose is not to alarm you but to inform you so that you can assess your symptoms and make an appropriate decision about what to do Even without insurance you can access health care in most cities If you dont know how to access free or lowcost care in your area call your local hospital or a crisis hotline They will be able to provide you with resources for free and lowcost health care so you can get this problem checked out Good luck to you First of all thank goodness you apparently dont have meningitis How scary In answer to your last question Yes I think the ER doctor should have explained to you exactly what to expect after your lumbar puncture In fact you should have received some sort of written instructions Beyond that I think they should have given you additional verbal information about what to expect due to experiencing six attempts Its possible the site is still sore because of multiple tries and because of hitting a tendon However if you begin to run a fever its time to seek medical attention Fever could be a sign of infection Lumbar punctures are performed under sterile conditions but infection can occur afterthefact I dont think four days of soreness at the puncture site is unreasonable but if youre concerned you might give your primary care provider a call It never hurts no pun intended to get these things checked out I hope you feel better soon Its difficult to say if these things are interrelated You might have constipationdiarrhea even if you didnt have anxietypanic attacks Lets take on the bowel problem first Whenever your bowels arent behaving themselves you should start with the basics Make sure you eat plenty of foods rich in fiber These can include fruits including dried fruit vegetables and whole grains Fiber helps move material through your intestines If you dont get enough fiber you can become constipated  Make sure youre drinking enough water Dehydration can lead to constipation Interestingly while too little fiber can cause constipation it also can lead to loose stools or diarrhea  If you have loose stools try increasing your fiber intake But stay away from fruits temporarily because eating fruit in large quantities can give you very loose stools Make sure youre exercising Exercise including walking can literally help get things moving in your bowels if youre constipated And exercise in general will help your body including your bowels function better If eating plenty of fiber drinking plenty of water and getting exercise dont solve your bowel issues then you should consult a medical professional Its possible you have irritable bowel syndrome or another condition that can or needs to be treated with medication Regarding the anxiety and panic attacks if youre not under the care of a psychologist for these conditions then I suggest you see someone Anxiety is very treatable today And since panic attacks often arise from unchecked anxiety treating your anxiety may make the panic attacks go away Wishing you well psoriasis If so not to worry its quite treatable Not sure is a friend it could be your thyroid I would go to a walkin clinic to get it checked out ProActive is the best daily product to keep your skin healthy and clearer than normal Its only about 2500 and it WORKS You also need to check with your family doctor or your Dermatologist

Buprenorphine will activate opioid receptors in the brain and prevent opiate withdrawal Buprenorphine is a partial agonist meaning that it has a limit to how much it can activate the opioid receptors It can prevent withdrawal but not create the euphoria Naloxone is an opiate antagonist and prevents the drug from being abused  meaning that if the Suboxone is crushed and injected the individual will go into full and immediate withdrawal When Suboxone is taken as directed the Naloxone is not noticeable and the Buprenorphine offers relief from withdrawal However when Suboxone is abused the Naloxone is fully activated and the individual will go into immediate withdrawal that cannot be reversed by taking other opiate drugs Taking Suboxone and Methadone is dangerous and may send you into full withdrawal You should talk with your doctor regarding your concerns regarding pain management trying to selfmedicate can lead to dangerous sideeffects and be fatal NO Under no circumstances should you take suboxone and methadone together you will end up in You need to see your pain management professional and explain that you are on suboxone and ask for something nonnarcotic for pain Ive heard there is a less evasive measure using sound waves to shrink the tonsils Is this true If u have had a paniac attack in the past AVOID caffeine at all costs I have always had anxiety 247 I dont drink soda or Starbucks but I had a frap at Starbucks one day and that set me over the edge I had to leave class and go right to the school psychiatrist Now I try to get decaf or ask them to halve the caff Bc espresso is crazy high in caf Esp if ur not use to it There are many potential mechanisms by which food may cause symptoms Allergic reactions are caused by allergic antibodies leading to immediate hypersensitivity reactions Nut allergy typically causes itching liptongue swelling nausea vomiting lightheadedness flushing andor rash The rash is usually hives welts but some develop other types of skin eruptions Ulcers in the mouth is an unusual manifestation Make a list of all the foods that cause the symptoms timecourse of development of symptoms in relationship to eating the food so your doctorallergic can further investigate Finding an asthma doctorpulmonologist to partner with if he does not already have one may be beneficial What medications is he taking on a routine basis for asthma For some patients with severe allergic asthma xolair may be helpful His doctor will be able to determine whether this is an appropriate possibility for him I do not know of a way to explain those symptoms in the context of your allergies I would mention them to your primary care doctor so an investigation into other possible causes can be undertaken Frequently patients with asthma or allergies experience a flare in their breathing or nasalocular symptoms when exposed to irritants such as strong odors perfumes new paint or new carpet Most of the time the symptoms are due to irritation instead of an allergic or toxic reaction to the chemicals All of your choices are good ones Have you tried trail mix eg almonds dried fruit walnuts Nuts are full of nutrients but have protein as well so that just a few can be filling Also a fiber based cereal with low fat milk is a snack that I often have when i have the munchies Heres a great article httpwwwwebmdcomdietfeaturessnackattack Also remember that sometimes if a person is stressed or tired he or she may think they are hungry but really it is a stress response Additionally if you are not drinking enough water during the day you may be thirsty and this may feel like hunger In any case drinking 68 glasses of water is key to be healthy Glad youre doing so well with healthy eating Keep up

breathing 100 oxygen does During a Migraine this pressure point provides the most instant relief possible I have been to my military PCM numerous times now with no avail Also my healthcare currently isnt accepting offbase referrals Therefore I am not able to see a Neurologist or a radiology center fora CT scan Thanks in advance for any help provided J   We are used to thinking about the telltale signs of heart attacks based upon many years of research and clinical observation of what men have experienced  chest discomfort arm and back pain and shortness of breath top the list But more recently doctors and their patients are recognizing that women may experience heart attacks differently Women may certainly experience chest pain but they should also be on the lookout for less obvious symptoms like nausea indigestion and palpitations in addition to shortness of breath and back pain In fact nearly half of the women in one study had no chest pain at all during their heart attack Fatigue and shortness of breath were the most common symptoms Whereas chest pain shortness of breath and fatigue are the most typical symptoms for men these heart attack warning signs for women should be considered carefully It typically isnt a problem to travel a few weeks after a minor heart attack although Id discuss this specifically with his physician It typically isnt a problem to travel a few weeks after a minor heart attack although Id discuss this specifically with his physician CRP is a blood test that gives information about your bodys overall inflammatory state Its a nonspecific test that can be elevated if you have a bad cold or suffer from other inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis However the test also can be elevated in individuals with heart disease even at an early state Studies suggest that we can predict who might develop heart problems later on by looking at their CRP levels today Some have argued that this test should be ordered on everyone and then we should treat those with high values with cholesterol medication and other therapies Others dont support this strategy Blockages in coronary arteries are caused by inflammation which results in damage to artery walls and accumulation of cholesterol plaque We know that smoking eating unhealthy foods diabetes and being sedentary are some of the risk factors for developing heart disease  genetics and family history play a role too Its important to focus on 1 what we can do to reduce our own personal risk and 2 incorporate medical treatment and lifestyle changes to prevent future events You could be experiencing bone spurs in your neck It is very painful can come and go and the severity can vary Turning your head a certain way can cause a flare up You should start with a simple xray then if that doesnt show the answer then proceed with an MRI Yes it could I am experiencing the exact same thing I am 53 and never had Migraines in my life until I was involved in a car wreck and hit my head I now get Migraines frequentlysometimes 23 a week You need to see a physician about this IMMEDIATELY Snacks should be high in fiber and have important nutrients Foods like whole grains beans fruits and vegetables all contain fiber plus other nutrients If you choose to have carbohydrates include foods that are lower on the glycemic index For more information about the glycemic index go here  Examples of foods that are lower on the glycemic index are fruits vegetables whole grains beans and nuts These kinds of foods wont be absorbed into your blood steam as quickly so you will feel more satisfied Snacks should also contain small amounts of protein as these foods take longer to digest and supply more energy over a longer period of time Foods such as beans nuts seeds and soy products offer protein to balance the carbohydraterich foods if eaten together in as a snack Follow this link for some snack ideas When I have my pains it is in the middle of my back It doesnt start on the right or left It starts where my spine is and moves around to the front to where it hurts to breathe and move The only thing that helps me are two bags of ice for my back and just under my ribcage and either 2 alieves or 2 midols I had to checked out and was hooked up to a machine and everything They said it was my breathing but I cant remember if that was exactly the case I lost 41 pounds but I could still feel the start of it but I would take medicine before it could go any further Hi First you should know what causes cancer One of the major things is tobacco smoking or genetic mutation from your DNA I recently just got over Pneumonia myself and according to my discharge papers it says that if you develop neck pain or stiffness that you should contact your doctor immediately I had a little bit of both but I believe mine was from the bed rest I would call your doctor and ask what they think you should do Hope you feel better soon it could be the left tonsilLook at it with a flashlight by looking at the throat If you see anything white white dots they need to see a doctor That is usually a sign of Strep Throat which can be extremely dangerous if not treated right away with antibiotics If the tonsil looks healthy then it could also be a lymph node Using my albuterol inhaler before exercising helps me I do recommend getting another doctors opinion It does seem like something that needs to be further evaluated However I would not assume he needs to see an oncologist just yet I recommend seeing another primary care pediatrician and going from there There is always a risk with anesthesia however the chances of things going wrong are slim for healthy children Children of young ages get anesthesia every day for procedures like this one I myself had it when I was just 6 months old and again at 7 years old for surgeries and all went perfect It sounds like it would be a good idea to get it removed especially since the surgeon is reassuring that there is a very slim chance of things going wrong Have you seen a doctor for this That is a very long time to go on with this and not see a doctor I recommend going to see one asap It sounds like Mono or Epstien Bar Virus They can cause each other thogh because I had both in Summer 2012 and I still got the swollen lympnodes If you get these from Mono they can last up to a yearnot suppose to but I do and to tell you the truth I think I am getting it again but a whole lot worse Mono can lead to Lymphoma same symptoms as Mono and I know that because my ex did and well I know I got Lymphoma or Mono again but anyways if you got Mono there is no treatment for it the only thing you can do is get a lot of rest and take some over the counter pain pills and you cannot do hardly any physical activity because when you have Mono your spleen gets swollen and if you fall you could rupture your spleen and the result for that is Hospital for a while Mononucleosis Symptoms Pain or discomfort Enlarged or swollen glands Fever Excessive sweating Night sweats Skin rash Sore throat Yellow skin Yellow eyes Decreased appetite Fatigue Headache Tenderness to touch Weakness generalized Swollen tonsils Tender glands Unable to blink or close eyelid Yes There are nerve roots between the bones that connect each vertebra If you have a slipped bulging andor herniate disc depending on which way the disc pushes it can affect any nerve that leads to the head andor anywhere else in your body and cause pain There has not been to my knowledge any studies showing that sexual deprivation causes any harm I am a 59yr old male with depression anxiety paruresis OCD  eating disorders  OCD stopped when I began to take antidepressants clean from eating disorders for some five yrs Also the medications I take greatly lessen my sexual impulses which I dont mind since I never acted on them The main problem is to focus on the problems which are definitely affecting your quality of life such as the depression  anxiety These may be a major reason why you have trouble keeping a job Contact your local federal office to see if you qualify for SSI and medical aid so you can see a qualified therapist and psychologist to get help for your emotional problems These doctors should also be able to help you with your sexual worries I wish you all the best my friend Might be gall bladder Median nerves symptoms can be caused by problems from the neck all the way down to the hand In some cases there are problems with the nerve itself and with the mylien covering You really need a more complete workup to determine the cause of your median nerve neuropathy rather than at face value assume its a problem with the carpal tunnel Some patients due require rerelease of the carpal tunnel or local flap to cover the median nerve depending on the problem if the workup reveals the cause of your symtpoms localize to the carpal tunnel region Thanks for the question Aspirin is a very risky medication to use during pregnancy  its use is generally cautioned in the 1st and 2nd trimester pregnancy category C and should generally be avoided in the 3rd trimester pregnancy category D Given your unique situation it is absolutely important that you talk to your physician and other health care providers to discuss the risks and benefits of your medications especially during pregnancy Also I encourage you to use one pharmacy with one medication profile so we can check for interactions and check for medications that should be avoided in pregnancy You should consider having all of your medications on a personal medication list and show this list to your doctor health care providers and pharmacist My son had problems with his lymph nodes swelling and after the fear of lymphoma we found out that the cause was infection Hopefully your outcome will be something easy to fix Enlarged lymph nodes in the neck and jaw area can be caused by several conditions If lymph nodes persistently remain enlarged after several weeks doctors usually consider a workup to help determine the cause Work up can include physical exam lab tests xrays and sometimes biopsy of an abnormal lymph node Some infections that commonly cause enlarged lymph nodes are strep throat mononucleosis cytomegalovirus toxoplasmosis tuberculosis and HIV infection There are many more possible infectious causes Some cancers cause enlarged lymph nodes such as head and neck cancers and lymphoma There are several other medical conditions such as lupus amyloidosis and sarcoidosis that can cause lymph node enlargement Certain medications can lead lymph node enlargement as a side effect It is best for your brother to follow up with his doctor who can evaluate the need to do further workup if lymph node enlargement persists

spelled correctly stones My girlfriend had it recently though it caused her a lot of pain at times The doctor said that gull stones can shift either up or down and get stuck there causing pain They told us that if it persisted that she would need to get her gull bladder removed because it can cause an infection in her pancreas if the stones didnt dislodge and return to normal Again she had sever pain and they only told us if it persists that that would need to be done I also have been on antidepressants numerous combinations for coming on 28 years now I normally would go through a needed med adjustment once every 3 to 7 years but now I am longer is benefitting from any of the normal drug combinations MAOIs and even had shock treatment with no results The only think I discorded was that when I took my ADD meds I would feel better for a hour or so But there has to be some better way of having the will to life then getting happy off of my Addrell Is there any hope for someone who has who has reached this point because if I have a chose of living to be 80 felling like this then I would rather live 10 years happy on the Addrell and die earlier A dermatologist can examine the skin

they become thicker or bulge up This appears as a swollen area to observe and one can feel the lump or muscle swelling as well Its not a true edema or fluidtype swelling Heat or ice can help painful

snacks 1 Plain Greek Yogurt its high in protein and really fills you up I sweeten it with a little bit of fruit or 1 packet of splenda 2 A bowl of steel cut oats withs almonds cranberries and honey

Butter and Banana sandwich on whole wheat Its a great treat If my belts a little tigt Ill only have half a sandwich Make sure you measrue your peanut butter serving 1 to 2 tablespoons 5 2 slices center cut bacon and apple slices I dont eat this alot because of the saturated fat in bacon but it definitely fills you up 6 Trail mix almonds pecans raisins with minichocolate chips be sure to measure your serving and pair with some raw veggies to fill it out 7 Sliced apple with 12 tablespoons of peanut or almond butter 8 String Cheese Almonds and a serving of fruit 9 My all time favorite

problems However there are 3 key points to keep in mind 1 Dont clasp your hands behind your head Many times as people tire they begin pulling on there head to bring their body upirritating the neck 2

Since your dealing with an injury its important to start slow concentrate on your form and proceed cautiously before attempting new exercises Also run these exercises by the physician treating you for this condition to avoid reinjury For some additional exercises and video directions for some great exercises click on the links below It sounds like your diet may be out of balance Make sure to include 35 food groups with main meals and 23 with snacks lean protein whole grains fruit vegetables dairy healthy fats For example a salad with veggies and dressing includes vegetables and healthy fats but that alone is usually not enough to keep you full So add a protein source to it beanschicken and round it a piece of whole grain bread and a side of yogurt The goal is to include foods with a high satiety value meaning they take longer to digest and keep you fuller longer Here are some ways to increase the satiety power of your meals Make sure most of your meals have a source of protein Protein is the most filling of the macronutrients carbohydrates protein and fat So include nuts on your cereal a boiled egg or chicken on salads and build your dinner meals around a lean protein source Include healthy fats with your meals Fat also helps to slow digestion and is satisfying Try chopped avocado on salads nuts topped on yogurt and veggies sauteed in olive oil A healthy fat source at every meal will increase satisfaction Fiberrich foods are also filling Include fruits and veggies with meals as you have whole grains beanslegumes and nuts and seeds While its great to eat healthy make sure you eat meals you enjoy that also taste good That include sweets in moderation A small piece of dark chocolate or cookie after a meal can increase satisfaction and help keep cravings at bay Keep trying different things until you find meals that are not only healthy but satisfying I cannot find anything linking panic attacks to high blood sugars It seems plausible that increases in stress hormones during a panic attack could temporarily increase blood sugars Your sons A1C and fasting glucose are normal so the high blood sugars are not caused by diabetes Most people who eliminate up sugar have a hard time the first week or so and then feel better after that The problem is that eventually most everyone who gives up sugar will eat it again  and that is when the problems start A better strategy might be to cut back on sugar  and try to find more wholesome forms of sweet foods Instead of fighting against your sweet tooth which may cause the eventual overconsumption honor sweet cravings by finding more wholesome options You can try a few squares of dark chocolate be mindful and savor it or bit of honey in your oatmeal that is topped with fruit and nuts The result will be a diet that is much lower in sugar but higher in satisfaction For more tips on dealing with sugar cravings see this WebMD article Good luck with your health journey Asthma is a condition that results in inflammation in the airways which makes them overly sensitive to triggers in the environment In response to triggers cold allergies smoke or others many people with asthma experience episodes of tightening of the muscle layers surrounding the airways bronchospasm The airways bronchi constrict airflow is reduced and breathing becomes difficult Daily inhaled steroids reduce the ongoing inflammation in asthma prevent asthma symptoms and tend to reduce their severity when they do occur Inhaled albuterol relaxes and opens constricted airways during episodes of bronchospasm Numerous alternative therapies for asthma have been proposed and studied Acupuncture chiropractic massage biofeedback and dietary changes have their advocates but so far have not shown any consistent benefit in controlled studies In one small study people who regularly performed deep breathing exercises called buteyko breathing reported fewer symptoms and less need for albuterol than the other people in the trial Once an asthma attack has started a bronchodilator medicine like albuterol is usually necessary There is no recommended alternative therapy For many people asthma is a serious medical condition so before making any changes to your treatment plan talk with your doctor Septic shock is a dangerous condition that results when a severe infection evades the bodys defenses The bodys normal response to infection is a process called inflammation When inflammation is confined to one area of infection like a wound or a pneumonia the natural chemicals released help fight and control the infection In septic shock these inflammatory chemicals spread through the bloodstream where they dont belong These chemicals and substances released by bacteria cause blood pressure to fall to dangerously low levels Antibiotics are the most important treatment for septic shock However antibiotics alone dont correct septic shock because the bodys response to the infection is as harmful as the infection itself Intravenous medicines to increase blood pressure vasopressors are needed during septic shock Many people with septic shock become unconscious and some require mechanical ventilation life support to breathe Septic shock can be fatal and there are few effective treatments In most cases treatment means providing life support until antibiotics and the persons immune system clear the infection and the massive inflammatory process subsides  CIP also known as  is one or more rare conditions where a person cannot feel and has never felt physical pain Paitents with this dissorder can still feel touch they just can not feel pain It is a neurological problem You should get checked out by a neurologist to make sure everything is okay Losing excess weight exercising regularly controlling diabetes and high blood pressure lowering bad LDL cholesterol and stopping cigarette smoking are crucial steps in preventing heart attacks and strokes The association between homocysteine levels and atherosclerosis is generally weaker compared to the known risk factors of diabetes high blood pressure hypertension high cholesterol level and cigarette smoking It is recommended that healthy adults eat more fresh fruits and vegetables eat less saturated fat and cholesterol and take one multivitamin daily One multivitamin will supply 400 mcg a microgram is oneone thousandth of a gram per day of folic acid in addition to vitamins B6 B12 and other important vitamins Women are more likely to encounter delays in establishing the diagnosis of heart attack than men This is in part because women tend to seek medical care later than men and in part because diagnosing heart attacks in women can sometimes be more difficult than diagnosing heart attacks in men The reasons include Women are more likely than men to have atypical heart attack symptoms such as Neck and shoulder pain Abdominal pain Nausea Vomiting Fatigue Shortness of breath Silent heart attacks heart attacks with little or no symptoms are more common among women than among men Women have a higher occurrence than men of chest pain that is not caused by heart disease for example chest pain from spasm of the esophagus Women are less likely than men to have the typical findings on the ECG that are necessary to diagnose a heart attack quickly Women are more likely than men to have angina chest pain due to lack of blood supply to the heart muscle that is caused by spasm of the coronary arteries or caused by disease of the smallest blood vessels microvasculature disease Cardiac catheterization with coronary angiograms Xray studies of the coronary arteries that are considered the most reliable tests for CAD will reveal normal coronary arteries and therefore cannot be used to diagnose either of these two conditions Women are more likely to have misleading or false positive noninvasive tests for CAD then men Because of the atypical nature of symptoms and the occasional difficulties in diagnosing heart attacks in women women are less likely to receive aggressive thrombolytic therapy or coronary angioplasty and are more likely to receive it later than men Women also are less likely to be admitted to a coronary care unit  Factors that increase the risk of developing atherosclerosis and heart attacks include increased blood cholesterol high blood pressure use of tobacco diabetes mellitus male gender and a family history of coronary heart disease While family history and male gender are genetically determined the other risk factors can be modified through changes in lifestyle and medications High Blood Cholesterol Hyperlipidemia A high level of cholesterol in the blood is associated with an increased risk of heart attack because cholesterol is the major component of the plaques deposited in arterial walls Cholesterol like oil cannot dissolve in the blood unless it is combined with special proteins called lipoproteins Without combining with lipoproteins cholesterol in the blood would turn into a solid substance The cholesterol in blood is either combined with lipoproteins as very lowdensity lipoproteins VLDL lowdensity lipoproteins LDL or highdensity lipoproteins HDL The cholesterol that is combined with lowdensity lipoproteins LDL cholesterol is the bad cholesterol that deposits cholesterol in arterial plaques Thus elevated levels of LDL cholesterol are associated with an increased risk of heart attack The cholesterol that is combined with HDL HDL cholesterol is the good cholesterol that removes cholesterol from arterial plaques Thus low levels of HDL cholesterol are associated with an increased risk of heart attacks Measures that lower LDL cholesterol andor increase HDL cholesterol losing excess weight diets low in saturated fats regular exercise and medications have been shown to lower the risk of heart attack One important class of medications for treating elevated cholesterol levels the statins have actions in addition to lowering LDL cholesterol which also protect against heart attack Most patients at high risk for a heart attack should be on a statin no matter what the levels of their cholesterol High Blood Pressure Hypertension High blood pressure is a risk factor for developing atherosclerosis and heart attack Both high systolic pressure when the heart beats and high diastolic pressure when the heart is at rest increase the risk of heart attack It has been shown that controlling hypertension with medications can reduce the risk of heart attack Tobacco Use Smoking Tobacco and tobacco smoke contain chemicals that cause damage to blood vessel walls accelerate the development of atherosclerosis and increase the risk of heart attack Diabetes Diabetes Mellitus Both insulin dependent and noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus type 1 and 2 respectively are associated with accelerated atherosclerosis throughout the body Therefore patients with diabetes mellitus are at risk for reduced blood flow to the legs coronary heart disease erectile dysfunction and strokes at an earlier age than nondiabetic people Patients with diabetes can lower their risk through rigorous control of their blood sugar levels regular exercise weight control and proper diets Male Gender At all ages men are more likely than women to develop atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease Some scientists believe that this difference is partly due to the higher blood levels of HDL cholesterol in women than in men However this gender difference narrows as men and women grow older Family History of Heart Disease Individuals with a family history of coronary heart disease have an increased risk of heart attack Specifically the risk is higher if there is a family history of early coronary heart disease including a heart attack or sudden death before age 55 in the father or other firstdegree male relative or before age 65 in the mother or other female firstdegree female relative As described in the first example above the symptoms of a panic attack appear suddenly without any apparent cause They may include racing or pounding heartbeat palpitations chest pains stomach upset dizziness lightheadedness nausea difficulty breathing a sense of feeling smothered tingling or numbness in the hands hot flashes or chills trembling and shaking dreamlike sensations or perceptual distortions terror a sense that something unimaginably horrible is about to occur and one is powerless to prevent it a need to escape nervousness about the possibility of losing control and doing something embarrassing fear of dying Although the duration of a panic attack can vary greatly it typically lasts for more than 10 minutes is one of the most distressing conditions that a person can experience and its symptoms can closely mimic those of a heart attack Typically most people who have one attack will have others and when someone has repeated attacks with no other apparent physical or emotional cause or feels severe anxiety about having another attack he or she is said to have panic disorder A number of other emotional problems can have panic attacks as a symptom Some of these illnesses include posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD schizophrenia and intoxication or withdrawal from certain drugs of abuse Certain medical conditions like thyroid abnormalities and anemia as well as certain medications can produce intense anxiety Examples of such medications include stimulants like methylphenidate Ritalin diabetes medications like metformin and insulin antimalarial medications like quinine as well as corticosteroid withdrawal such as withdrawal from dexamethasone Decadron As individuals with panic disorder seem to be at higher risk of having a heart valve abnormality called mitral valve prolapse MVP this possibility should be investigated by a doctor since MVP may dictate the need for special precautions to be taken when the individual is being treated for any dental problem While the development of panic attacks have been attributed to the use of food additives like aspartame alone or in combination with food dyes more research is needed to better understand the role such substances may have on this disorder Anxiety attacks that take place while sleeping also called nocturnal panic attacks occur less often than panic attacks during the daytime but affect about 4070 of those who suffer from daytime panic attacks This symptom is also important because people who suffer from panic symptoms while sleeping tend to have more respiratory distress associated with their panic They also tend to experience more symptoms of depression and other psychiatric disorders compared to people who do not have panic attacks at night Nocturnal panic attacks tend to cause sufferers to wake suddenly from sleep in a state of sudden fear or dread for no apparent reason In contrast to people with sleep apnea and other sleep disorders sufferers of nocturnal panic can have all the other symptoms of a panic attack The duration of nocturnal panic attacks tends to be less than 10 minutes but it can take much longer to fully calm down for those who experience them While panic disorder in adolescents tends to have similar symptoms as in adults symptoms of panic disorder in younger children are less likely to include the thoughtbased or socalled cognitive aspects Specifically teenagers are more likely to feel unreal or as if they are functioning in a dreamlike state derealization or be frightened of going crazy or of dying Symptoms of panic attacks in women tend to include more avoidance of anxiety provoking situations show more frequent recurrence and more often result in the use of medical care compared to panic attack symptoms in men The frequency of panic attacks may increase decrease or remain unchanged during pregnancy The treatment of neck pain depends on its precise cause Treatment options include rest heat or cold applications traction soft collar traction physical therapy ultrasound massage manipulation local injections of cortisone or anesthetics topical anesthetic creams topical pain patches muscle relaxants analgesics and surgical procedures Home remedies for treatment such as Jacuzzi treatment neck pain relief exercises and stretches and neck pain relief products such as neck pillows for sleep and hot pads can be very beneficial for relief of some forms of neck pain There are many treatment options depending on the particular neck problem and past treatment experiences Alternative treatments that have been used for chronic neck pain include acupuncture Neck pain is commonly associated with dull aching Sometimes pain in the neck is worsened with movement of the neck Other symptoms associated with some forms of neck pain include numbness tingling tenderness sharp shooting pain fullness difficulty swallowing pulsations swishing sounds in the head dizziness or lightheadedness and lymph node gland swelling Neck pain can also be associated with headache facial pain shoulder pain and arm numbness or tingling upper extremity paresthesias These associated symptoms are often a result of nerves becoming pinched in the neck For example compressing the nerve of sensation to the back of the head which comes out of the neck causes headaches in the back of the head Depending on the condition sometimes neck pain is accompanied by upper back andor lower back pain as is common in inflammation of the spine from ankylosing spondylitis Congratulations It sounds like you are doing an excellent job with your lifestyle changes Diet and exercise are the cornerstones of treating both heart disease and diabetes But at the same time there are many studies that show that taking statins after a heart attack can actually help prevent future heart attacks as well A major study called the CARE trial showed that people who were on statins for at least 5 years after a heart attack were less likely to need further procedures such as bypass surgery or stents They were also less likely to die from heart disease Statins can help keep plaque from building up in the arteries including those around the heart In some cases they can actually cause a regression of the plaque A statin may also help stabilize this plaque so that it is less likely to break and cause a blood clot A blood clot in an artery on the heart wall is what causes most heart attacks It is very important that you work closely with your doctor Your lipid levels and other risk factors should continue to be carefully monitored Talk to your doctor about any concerns you have about your medications Working together you will be able to come up with a long term treatment plan that is right for you Keep up the great work This is a great question You are probably referring to a presentation that was made at the 2012 Canadian Cardiovascular Congress by Dr Jacob Udell from the University of Toronto Dr Udell gave the results of his research involving over 3000 patients About half of them had existing heart disease and the other half did not The influenza vaccine had been given to about one half of the participants The other group received a placebo or harmless fake vaccine Results after one year showed that those who had received the real vaccine were about half as likely to have had a stroke a heart attack or death due to a heart problem These results were exciting and very interesting However the research looked at only 4 small studies done between 1994 and 2008 Also the total number of people that had a stroke heart attack or cardiac death was very small Researchers are now trying to construct a larger study to confirm the results It is a known fact that the flu can be associated with worsening of existing lung and heart disease It seems logical that anything that would decrease the risk of getting the flu would therefore reduce the risk for these complications But more research is needed to draw firm conclusions We do know that over 200000 American are hospitalized each year with complications from influenza And that there are between 3000 and 49000 flurelated deaths annually The CDC now recommends that everyone over the age of 6 months should get the flu vaccine Check with your doctor if you have not already had one this year Possibly hypothyroid Look up conditions on here and see if they relate That would be my best guess without knowing more It can make you feel really bad if left untreated I want to  talk about the use of aspirin for prevention of heart attacks strokes and other blood clotting problems Aspirin is commonly used for minor aches and pains and to reduce fever Aspirin also combats the effects of platelets blood cells that help blood clot This helps reduce the number of heart attacks and strokes Indeed platelets are essential to human life because an excessively low count would cause bleeding But platelets can also be involved in too much clot formation When this occurs it can block a blood vessel and can lead to many potentially lifethreatening problems including heart attack stroke and pulmonary embolism a blood clot in the lungs Its important to achieve a balance between too much clotting and not enough clotting There is much confusion regarding the use of aspirin in prevention of heart attack and stroke The use of aspirin to prevent a first heart attack or stroke  called primary prevention  is widely debated There have been approximately seven clinical trials testing the effects of aspirin in someone with no prior history of heart attack or stroke The doses have varied from 50 mg to 500 mg While not all the trials showed benefit only one trial showed an increased risk of bleeding but those were patients on high dose aspirin Based on this ambiguous data the current American College of CardiologyAmerican Heart Association guidelines recommend aspirin for primary prevention only in men with diabetes and intermediate cardiovascular risk and without an increased risk of bleeding Those patients who have a 10 risk of a cardiovascular event over a 10year period are defined as intermediate risk The European Society of Cardiology guidelines do not recommend aspirin in primary prevention In patients with previous stroke heart attack or certain other blood clotting problems aspirin has beneficial effects For these people The American College of CardiologyAmerican Heart Association guideline recommends starting aspirin 75 mg to 162 mg and continuing indefinitely in all patients unless other medical problems prevent its use The benefits of aspirin need to outweigh the risk You should see your doctor Sharp pain like that could be a sign of something serious but there is no way to know without seeing your doctor I can suppose that you have intervertebral hernia It would be better if you go to the doctor and get MRI Hi and I get it Dont know that it is normal nor not normal but I do know that vitamin B1 helps that If you take 100mg of B1 with a meal in the ams you will notice it has a calming effect on your When the body is running low on B1 one tends to be more upset panicky etc So you could try taking B1 I do this each time I start noticing I am getting upset etc Dont take it after dinner though as it might keep you up and also it might give you funny dreams the first night but after that you will notice you will be calmer and ok with things and you sleep will be better too I am not a doctor so this is not scientifically proven by me but I do know it has that effect on myself and my friends Hope if helps Am a pharmacy student I think that this problem is mainly related to stress I see that you you can try many things for anxiety Including exerciseyogasportmusicother than that limiting caffeine consumption can make you feel better  Ive been dealing with panic disorder officially since 1976 Im not sure there is just one singular cause of it period It could be in your diet the air or even the water we drink Something triggers the flight  fight syndrome when there doesnt seem to be a reason for it Something is activating the adrenal glands I do think stress while its hard to tell if youre under stress sometimes will cause the episodes or make them more intense Dealing with this issue when youre new to it can cause much stress Ive been on benzodiazepines on and off since 1976 Ive been more on meds over the last 25 years than off Your medication doses may need adjusted but anti depressants tend to give you a boost or make you feel weird which can kick in an attack Try looking for more holistic approaches to feeling better like change your diet see it if helps Exercise try meditation reading or listening to your favorite music and breathing exercises help a lot The medication should you stay on it long will eventually need changes to another type or a higher dose My panic was so bad I had to open my own company to stay at home whenever I had to It usually comes and goes as they say waxes and wanes Usually it has other phobias which develop as well You want to steer clear of people and places which you think cause the attacks I dont know that they will ever disappear however they should diminish in frequency and intensity Best of luck and work on your end helps a lot This much I do know  If the oxygen in any place is lower or higher than normal most likely will kick in a panic attack  httpswwwgooglecomsearchqbreathableoxygenpercentagerlscommicrosoftenusieUTF8oeUTF8startIndexstartPage1gwsrdssl Sure sounds very probable with a low oxygen content in a room Humans do well by inhailing 19  21  oxygen Any more or usually less will kick in a flight or fight syndrome Wow imagine how the patient feels when there are more lungs sucking up their air and blowing

you shouldnt have anything to worry about If you want to be sure then you can see your doctor again to have another round of allergy tests I would seek a Physician mfriend at your Doctors Office with more extensive testing ER is limited as to its testings etc they are primarily for emergencies however they can help with treating you immediately until you go to your Physician Thank God for ER but they are truly only for emergencies they will diagnosis  treat for what they diagnosis until you with your Physician I am not sure of your meds reactions however you need to go to your Doctor and stay in close contact with himher If you havent been taking it long you should be alright yes i can tell you from personal experience that it can and does just keep staying away from the stuff theres a lot of people who dont feel like that and they will pressure you and pressure you to keep smoking it but you have to just not smoke it its still gonna be in your system for awhile if you just dont smoke it in time the symptoms will get milder and milder and will eventually dissipate just do not smoke that sh anymore and you will be fine trust me Hi and thanks so much for your question Sounds like youre a nocturnal eater like so many people out there Here are some thoughts and recommendations As a heart patient myself 16 months post stent placement and on Plavix I had to have a Laminectomy and before the Neurosurgeon would touch me I had to get a Cardiac clearance from my Cardiologist He refused to give it until my 1 year anniversary I ended up almost completely paralyzed and had my surgery 2 days after my anniversary date They WILL NOT operate on you without a cardiac clearance Good luck and God bless Im a firm believer in a conservative approach to everything and I dont feel that a diagnosis of an anxiety disorder necessarily requires medication It may require medication but first I believe other things should be attempted First I think you should look at any stress you may have in your life because there may be something that is causing you stress and which can be bringing this on Have you considered what might be happening in your life lately Remember stress builds up over time so it may be something that has been something about which you were unaware as to how much it was affecting you The medication you were given although originally formulated to treat depression is now used for panic attacks Since anxiety and panic attacks usually also have a component of depression these medications have been found effective There are of course other older medications which can be just as effective It looks like your doctor was providing bridge therapy which means he was providing the Xanax to help you until the other medication was fully effective Research indicates that panic disorder may happen as we reach later midlife even though weve never had them before This may be a function of our changing biology and nothing more It may also however reflect the change in stressors in our life as we age For that reason I suggest you look at your lifestyle and see if there might be something that is distressing for you Since its now been five years since you had your first panic attack and you said youve tried many medications without success Im wondering who was doing the prescribing Sometimes it takes a combination of more than one medication for you to get relief from persistent panic attacks Several other things which can help in controlling anxiety include regular mild exercise  proper diet access to social activities outside of the home positive self talk and relaxation breathing Getting yourself out of the home and having some time for yourself is always a good idea Thats where a yoga class or even one for tai chi would be good because it accomplishes two things it gets you out and it provides exercise that is physically and emotionally relaxing Try some of these things and see how helpful they can be It may take a few weeks but its worth the effort It doesnt seem to usually be a random occurrence that anxiety attacks come with caffeine use There may be a difference in the caffeine that you are ingesting For example different types of coffees contain different levels of caffeine Some of the popular coffee shops grew a particularly potent coffee which can be very unsettling in terms of sparking anxiety Caffeine can also be ingested via soda candy and OTC medications Its wise to always read the labels carefully Of course the instances where you have had caffeine and have had a panic attack may be precipitated by both the caffeine and some stressful situation You might want to begin keeping a log of when this occurs so that you can look for any similar variables I know this is almost like being a researcher but thats what all of us have to do research our own lives  Absolutely people do get sick to their stomach when they are stressed and have a panic attack its a pretty common occurrence so dont feel youre alone or that you are in some way weak What do you do to handle your stress on a daily or weekly basis I would recommend that there are several selfhelp things that you can begin to do for yourself The first of these in addition to exercise would be to ensure that you were eating a balanced diet get sufficient sleep get out with friends and socialize on some semiregular basis get involved in activities you enjoy that are not stressful and used relaxation breathing on a daily basis One thing you should also consider is having a medical checkup just to ensure there are no physical problems luckylucas First have you had any traumatic experiences in the past few years You describe reliving these exeriences for days and in one case you mention this has been going on for years Do you suffer from hypervigilence always looking over your shoulder to see if anything frightening is there Do you see on TV in public hear conversations or noises that remind you of a traumatic event Do you have startled responses to certain stimuli that remind you of traumatic issues Is your sleep good or bad Do you anger easily or isolate yourself If so you may want to see a Psychologist or Psychiatrist and have an evaluation for PTSD Disorders like phobias panic attacks depression and obsessive compulsive behaviors are very much a part of the PTSD syndrome The key to your question is I cant make it go away which is a classic example of PTSD These are called Intrusive Thoughts you cannot get rid of Ordinarily treatment for GAD Panic Attack and OCD are very treatable with therapy and medication However PTSD is one of only two memory based disorders in DSM5 The other is Dementia or Alzheimers Disease Basically what I am saying is you cannot erase a memory is why PTSD is usually a life long disorder with no cure The best treatment is a combination of medications and management of your symptoms I hope this helps Patrick4287 Licensed Psychologist go to a doctor to have it looked at it may need to be removed Yes if your doctor is willing to say that you cannot work because of it There certainly might be You really dont state the neuropathy youre experiencing If its pain numbness tingling  neuropathy is a general term as given to a condition of the nerves so you really need to supply more information Until one has that information to assume anything would be wrong to state on this page The neck to finger tips may be a red flag for a nerve degeneration  but to be honest  this sounds like perhaps a circulatory situation Best to see your doctor and have a workup done Best of luck to you You should be checked out to be sure you dont have a concussion You may have strained your neck more likely than any kind of spinal injury but conking your head could have resulted in a bruise on the brain  thats what a concussion is and you dont need to have lost consciousness to have one I had a number of concussions that were not treated in the past and regretted it Its better to check it out than to be sorry After all your brain is the most important organ in your body A promptcare location or your local ED should check out your head and neck In the meantime put some ice in a baggie and rest it gently against your head Keep your head elevated Dont take any meds that could fog your head and make a diagnosis difficult Good Luck No If you still have those symptons you need to go see your doctor If they have gone I would worry unless they come back Good luck I know what you are going through is scary I have had most of the symptoms you mentioned in the past I think that it would be worth seeing a doctor because they provided me with a lot help and now I am more stable I know that it can also be scary going to a doctor but remember that you are in control of the situation and if you feel uncomfortable suggest a new doctor I hope this helps I am not an expert and am only answering from my own experience Even back to when I was younger I can remember always being hungry and always eating People used to comment on how much I ate and that I didnt gain an ounce I also try to eat healthy and love vegetables Two years ago I was diagnosed with hypoglycemia low blood sugar not due to diabetes Especially around the time of my period my blood sugar is hard to control I feel like Im starving and of course crave chocolate I usually give in and then that starts a viscious cycle with my blood sugars I try to have a variety of vegetables fruits cheeses peanut butter and whole grain snacks wheat thins triscuits etc on hand So if you are feeling the signs shaky dizzy weak grouchy feel like you could eat a freakin cow LOL you may want to have your blood sugars tested I have had the same symptoms It could just be a pinched nerve or disc damage To find out for sure youll need to see an Orthopedist Neurosurgeon or Neurologist and get an MRI I had surgery for mine and was pain free the next day c4ncer I had the same problem severely a few years ago almost every day to the point that I had to retire early I improved quite a bit years ago with the help of a service dog who could sense when I was about to have an attack and alert me to take antianxiety medicine before the attack happened However what really helped me at first was to take prophylactic medication until my generalized level of anxiety decreased I did relaxation desensitization therapy and other relaxation methods like yoga but it wasnt until the attacks reduced that any of it helped In the meantime the best thing you can do for your friend is to help her with a solution for her REAL fear  vomiting in public Encourage her to carry a plastic ziploc bag in her purse so if she does get sick she wont make a mess that others will have to deal with and tell her if she feels that she is going to be sick in public you will help her get to a private place to be sick if necessary There is also an overthecounter medication called Emetrol that will calm the vomiting reflex and allow her to relax and calm down I still have occasional serious nausea attacks but I ALWAYS carry at least water and sometimes diet soda to calm my stomach For what its worth I think my extreme anxiety on the subject was caused by a kindergarten classmate who vomited all over me during naptime The fear of vomiting in public is not typical but it can be very debilitating  and it is much more difficult to treat than a fear of heights or claustrophobia It is virtually impossible to do progressive desensitization for vomiting  its kind of difficult to partially vomit then relax It could be a pinched nerve or God forbid an aneurysm PLEASE see your doctor or go to the emergency room immediately This is NOT something you want to take any chances with You are the best advocate for your health take advantage of that and take care of any problems that come up with your health  and take any preventative measures to make sure you stay healthy Wrinkled necks have to be treated much more delicately much more carefully because there is a little greater risk of problems because the neck skin is thinner It doesnt heal as well it doesnt regenerate as well The facial skin is fabulous pretty much got that down were kind of still at the frontiers at what to do with the neck and the upper chest from sun damage and aging But a combination of bleach creams low intensity laser like treatments like intense pulse light which is popular and its good because its safe but you have to have a series You cant expect it to be one blast and have the job done as when we do the chemical on the face when its a one time treatment But typically over a period of a year with 5 or 6 treatments and they are quick they are office visits in and out no down time virtually no discomfort add a little bleach cream into the mix and that skin will look better Not as perfect as the best result from a chemical skin peel on the face but were working on the neck I dont have enough information none in fact about you to make a blind diagnosis If you are having panic attacks you will need to see your medical provider or a psychiatrist to help you There are some excellent medications that can hopefully fix this for you Perhaps Redness and swelling are signs of infection or inflammation so it would be wise to see your medical provider to determine the reason Inflammation can be caused by the suture material but your biggest concern would be a wound infection Infected wounds can quickly get out of hand so do not delay in getting this properly examined It is a problem if you do not know the CAUSE of your symptoms Rather than try and figure out what you have or worry about having a heart attack it would be best for you to be examined by a medical professional  someone that can take a thorough medical history examine you order an diagnostic tests and give you the true answer Unfortunately this is not something that can be done blindly over the Internet That is really up to you I dont have enough information about the type of pain severity location duration of the pain your age etc to really make that decision for you The only way you can get this problem properly evaluated to SEE your medical provider I see no point in waiting at all As much as I would like to help you you cannot be blindly diagnosed over the Internet by providing a list of vague symptoms While I am sympathetic to your lack of insurance and financial constraints the ONLY way that you can get to the bottom of this four year old mystery is to see a medical professional  one who will perform a thorough medical examination and order some diagnostic lab tests Sorry There can be many causes for itchy skin but one common cause that can occur in those areas would be atopic dermatitis eczema Experts say that atopic dermatitis is not a rash that itches but rather an itch that rashes so itching is the primary symptom Of course when these areas itch you will scratch This can create an itchscratch cycle that can only be broken by 1 take an antihistamine like Claritin or Zyrtec to control the itching 2 reduce the inflammation by using hydrocortisone cream and finally 3 do your best not to scratch especially to the point where you may break the skin This will set the stage for a secondary infection and make things worse Yes an old heart attack may still show up on an electrocardiogram especially when having a stress test Have your doctor go over this test result since I have no way of seeing it of course Biofeedback for hormonal imbalance Never heard of it Sounds a little strange to me There is no way that anyone will know that you are taking birth control pills unless you choose to tell them or they drop out of your purse and someone sees them Whatever odd biofeedback test for hormonal imbalance that you are having is unlikely to reveal that you or anyone else is taking oral contraceptives Yes it is safe Unfortunately no Triamcinolone will not help Bells Palsy Prescription oral steroids if taken early can help but the topical steroid creams will not have any effect on this condition Yes in my opinion Taking them out sooner 710 days depending on the size and location of the sutures would reduce the chances of getting a rail road track scar but if you are not the type of person that scars easily it may not be a big problem As long as those sutures do not get buried in the skin during those extra days you should be fine Thirteen days may not be ideal but it may be the best you can do I am guessing but are you traveling and may not be home to get them out eariler NoThere are no bursas in this area but you can get neck pain for a variety of other reasons and causes It would be wise to see your medical provider so that you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated Insurance or not there is very little that can be accomplished over the Internet in the way of diagnosis or treatment Unless a medical provider can examine your daughter firsthand it would not be possible to confirm or dispute her original diagnosis let alone effectively treat her The diagnosis of gout would require a blood test as well as evaluating her challenged immune system As you know this cannot be done online The most expensive care in the US is at an emergency room What she may have is not considered an emergency so she would be better off finding a free clinic or one that charges on a sliding scale Or you can spend some time so she can get insurance like Obamacare ACA I would not recommend her using flea and tick spray for dogs Depends on how hairy you areif you were Sasquatch you could certainly have head lice on nonhead areas Mostly head lice live on the head occasionally the eyebrows and body lice live on the other parts including the clothing The pubic area can have pubic lice aka crabs I have no way of confirming or disputing this chiropractors diagnosis but I do have issues with the treatment plan Degeneration by definition is wear and tear often due to aging I dont believe it is possible to reverse aging by chiropractic adjustments but then again I am not a chiropractor who believes in those things Before mortgaging your house see an orthopedist for a medical opinion and have some imaging studies read by a radiologist I think you will find a different perspective on your neck and low back issues Yesthat would be one of the more logical possibilities to account for large reactive cervical lymph nodes I am glad you are seeing an ENT Zithromax will have no effect on influenza It is an antibiotic and this would only work for a BACTERIAL infection influenza is a virus The prednisone may have been for wheezing  Neither medication will cause swollen lymph nodes but your underlying medical issues whether it was influenza or not certainly can You would need to see your medical provider again to properly evaluate the significance of those nodes I cant examine you of course but these knots are most likely reactive lymph nodes  You would need to see your medical provider to determine WHY this is happening Obviously a completely stopped heart cardiac arrest is more lifethreating since you only have a few precious minutes to get it ticking again or death will occur A heart attack is lay term that refers to dozens of different serious cardiac conditions some that are lifethreating and some notsomuch An Orthopedist would be the best place to start Are you sure it is a petechiae in your eye and not a tiny subconjunctival hemorrhage Hard coughing common in uncontrolled asthma can cause an innocent capillary rupturehemorrhage in the conjunctiva but not really true petechiae these occur on surfaces It cansome of the muscles of the neck attach directly to the skull This can cause a muscle tension type headache I dont knowI cant SEE them Catch a few put them in a container and let someone identify your unwanted scalp residents Your description is too vague to make a blind guess It is very difficult for me to comment on your case since I do not know any of the details including the reason for the antibitoics in the first place Not all swollen glands are bacterial so if you a a viral infection they would not help no matter what antibiotic you chose If you are getting worse it is up to your doctor to run some additional diagnostic test I think this would be better than just throwing another a 4th antibiotic at it without really knowing if the underlying reason justifies it Probably nothing at all You may have this extra hair genetically  but there is no reason for you to keep them You can wax em offpluck them outor see a specialist and have this extra hair permanently removed Most of these things are unwanted genetic gifts from your parents or grandparents but if you feel you are having a hormonal problem that is resulting in excess hair growth you would need to see your medical provider I do not believe that sex deprivation causes harm Countless people on this planet are celebate like priests or nuns and are quite welladjusted Humans have many biological urges If a person cuts you off in traffic you may want to cause him harm but you do not As a child in a candy store you may have the urge to steal candy but you dont You have strong sexual urges and you may be having difficulty dealing with them Because you also have depression anxiety OCD and panic attacks all of these feelings may be overwhelming you Yes you do need some help I am sorry but I am not aware of any web sites that deal with sexual deprivation but this would not be the way to go for you I do not know if you are a religious man but you may be able to find help through a church or churchsponsored organization Many communities have community mental health facilities that can provide some immediate and longterm care for you perhaps in the way of medications or counseling Rather than spend time on the Internet searching for sites that deal with sexual deprivation devote this time to help yourself find the proper care in your area I am confident that you will find help Taking your evaluation to a higher level is wise but remember there are many many reasons for a diminished lung capacity A pulmonologist is the preferred expert in this area Migraines are vascular headaches and not all headaches are migraines Migraine does not mean a severe headache it is just one type of over a hundred different kinds of headaches The type of headache you may be describing is one of the more common typesa muscletension headache but the pain under the breast is not a typical symptom Muscletension headache can certainly come from the neck Since you cannot be blindly diagnosed over the Internet I would suggest that you see your medical provider for a proper examination Not much You would be better off seeing your primary care medical provider or a psychiatrist to help you manage panic attacks Those problematic moles can be surgically removed easily by your medical provider if they do this type of procedure or a dermatologist There are many methods to do this but most are either a shave biopsy or an excisional biopsy Larger ones may require a tiny stitch or two smaller ones may just be cauterized This is definitely not something you can do a home The moles will then be sent to pathology to be tested to make sure they are benign There are no nonsurgical ways of removing them Sometimes This is called referred ear pain Because of the muscle connection from your neck to the area behind your ear the mastoid area pain in this sternocleidomastoid muscle can cause pain to be referred to the ear Pain can also be referred to the ear from problems in the mouth TMJ lymph nodes salivary glands and throat so if you are having problems in any of those areas please see your medical provider so you can be properly examined Dont forget that ear pain can also be a problem IN the ear too The risk of Lyme disease would depend on the TYPE of tick tiny deer ticks are the usual culprit not dog or wood ticks and if you live in an area that has a lot of Lyme cases If you had saved the tick the local health department may be able to check it for you Since I suspect you did not I would suggest that you all your local health department I dont know where you live for some better local advice or have your fiance call his medical provider You really do not enough information at this time to determine individual risk I can address your BPPV concerns but unfortunately it is not possible to predict how long you might have symptoms assuming you were correctly diagnosed BPPV has an annoying habit of coming back BPPV is an inner ear problem It does not cause palpitations or head rush and is not related to neck disorders so these symptoms are not likely associated Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo BPPV is the most common cause of vertigo The patient usually has episodes of recurring vertigo lasting several minutes or as brief as 15 seconds Specific movements of the head often provoke the attack usually following a brief delay of several seconds People quickly realize the specific head motion or motions which tends to trigger an attack There are effective treatments but you may need to see an ENT xmlnamespace prefix  o ns  urnschemasmicrosoftcomofficeoffice op sizsetfalse sizcache054537445470053730071828182845905 46 23 op Atenolol is a blood pressure medication that has been used for some anxiety issues If this seems to help him in these social situations then I do think it justifies using it I dont believe he will experience any adverse effects from taking this low dose There are other medications that may be more helpful if this does not work You are most likely getting hives Hives can be caused by the temperature change that you mentioned You can try taking a longacting antihistamine before these warm season exposures loritidine Zyrtec Allegra to see if it helps Urticaria caused by temperature changes may not be prevented by antihistamines however but it is worth a try Keeping your skin surface cooler would also seem to be a reasonable preventative wearing clothing that breathes I cant comment on the accuracy of his diagnosis since I cant examine your child but a threeyear old who has been vaccinated with the chicken pox vaccine can certainly get painful shingles It doesnt happen very often but I do see this several times a year in my busy clinical practice Maybe but it depends on which fingers are involved The nerves to the hand arm and fingers does originate in the neck Then get an opinion from a MEDICAL DOCTOR such as an orthopedist All you have now is your chiropractors opinion  someone who is getting some financial benefits from keeping you under care for a long period of time If you have osteoarthritis chiropractic is NOT going to cure you So see an orthopedist Have an MRI of your neck One form of vertigo could be caused by neckhead movements and that would be BPV benign positional vertigo but there can be hundreds of causes No it does not There are no rules in medicine that state a person can only have one medical issue at a time so you can have both but they are not related As you know I have no way of examining these mysterious red blisters over the Internet so I am at a disadvantage Hand Foot and Mouth disease will give whitish papules look like tiny blisters but are more firm on the PALMS of the hands SOLES of the feet and cankersore like lesions inside the mouth  What you are describing would not be consistent with Hand Foot and Mouth disease Maybe your doctor should refer you to a back specialist orthopedist for a higherlevel evaluation Musculoskeletal issues in the neck can be very complex so you will need a careful medical history thorough examination of your neckshoulders and most likely some imaging studies Dont ever worry about asking your doctor too many questions They are not working for freethey get wellpaid to address your concerns Not really A stint is improved vascularization but revasculariazation requires your coronary blood vessels to step up to the plate get bigger and create new vascular pathways to feed a starving heart You will lower the salt a little bit but food cooked and canned with salt will likely have salt still in the food You are better off with fresh or frozen vegetableswhere have the control over the amount of salt that is used Whiplash involves the neck not the lower back You will need to see your medical provider again so that the back can be properly evaluated Unless your friends are psychiatrists I would not trust their diagnosis of you being crazy I cannot give an medical explanation as to why your elbow cyst causes you to have neck spasm but I can tell you that nerves from the neck do go to your elbow area See your medical provider so you can have this socalled weird cyst properly diagnosed A bulging eardrum can cause vertigo due to the pressure This usually means a middle ear infection but cephalexin would not be my drug of choice to treat this in an adult although I dont know your dosage or medication history The medicine probably is not your culprit but rather your ear disorder Vertigo is also common in INNER EAR infections and these are often viral Viral infections do not respond to any antibiotic therapy Since I have no way of knowing your diagnosis or severity of symptoms you will need to consult your medical provider if you are not getting better I have to see your MRI to really make that call Personally I have to TWO rotator cuff repairs both failed and may be facing a third surgery in the future Each persons injury is really unique so it would really be impossible to blindly know if you need surgery or not unless I was intimately involved in your case I dont even know your age or how this incident occurred I can tell you that orthopedists are surgeons and surgeons do like to perform surgery Your cortisone injection was most likely for inflammation and pain so I hope that helps but it will not fix a complete tear The legs are only ONE problem when there are suspected peripheral artery disease A more critical artery would be the carotidsthe two main blood supplies to the brain The neck Doppler is to make sure the carotids are patent Contact dermatitis is a itchy rash caused by CONTACT with some allergensoap detergent perfume plant etc Eczema atopic dermatitis is geneticallydry skin They can both be treated with topical steroids like you are using but it can take a while to get it under control Contact dermatitis will continue to bother a person as long as the unidentified allergen is around Eczema can last a lifetime I certainly do not know enough about you or your case to pronounce you well and free of all cardiac disease If you are worried about the status of your heart see a cardiologist and have an ECG taken on a treadmill If the cardiologist pronounces you hearthealthy then you can be assured that all is well No This type of laser will not cause any problems with your vocal cords Get a paper tablet and write one thousand times I will not mess with a pimple in my ear every again Then call your medical provider explain the situation You will either be prescribed an oral antibiotic over the phone for the infection you most likely caused or you will need to be examined firsthandand then prescribed an antibiotic I have never heard that before and medically it does not make scientific sense My answer would be NO Maybe this could be a delayed drug reaction perhaps from the antibiotic course or this could be hives to something entirely different You will need to discuss this with your medical provider  someone who knows you the details of your care and someone that can examine you firsthand If it was a common brown tick often seen on dogs you are likely fine as long as you washed your hands A deer tick smaller can cause Lyme disease if the tick actually bit you and attached but no if you just picked it up from the floor Yes there is a high yuck factor but the chance of you picking up a illness from this act would be remote There is probably little or nothing that can be done medically to make you grow facial hair If those hair follicles were not present when you were born you cant grow new ones It is too late to change your parents and genetics so the amount of facial hair that you have now is about all you will get I dont think that medicines used for patchy baldness in men will work the same way on your face but that would be up to your doctor or a dermatologist to determine Testosterone a male hormone can cause some facial hair growth in men how are low but again if you do not have those follicles it may not help Your first step is to see a dermatologist There are more things that can cause neckback pain than scoliosis so I would suggest that you see a medical provider orthopedist for a consultation and higherlevel examination Neck pain is usually NOT solely related to scoliosis Having a comfortable bed is always good no matter what the reason for you back pain but you would have to try various mattresses and pillows to find the best combination for you What works for one person will not likely work for another It is possible Heres information about the ailment httpwwwwebmdcomskinproblemsandtreatmentsrockymountainspottedfever httpwwwwebmdcomskinproblemsandtreatmentspictureofrockymountainspottedfever It really sounds like you were exposed to it in the past but your body developed antibodies to it and beat it Looking at thy sympoms it would seem that youd remember a full blown case My son is biracial and his dr said that its just his tyroid gland that its ok that they are swollenjust as long as there is no painHe said that alot of boys get it Hi to both of you and I too am concerned about my wife Debra who is Type 2 seven rods in her back Dvt in her legs going thorough menopause has alllergies and she has all things that you have been experiencing You have to look at everything I tell my wife Debra to invesigate everything and find out what works for her and her Doctor said too that everything was fine I told her to research her Metformin and she decreased it by 1000mg a day Guess what she has never felt better all because she has been losing weight Everybody needs to adjust things in this life We also need to look at other things and it may be or not the problem like weather flu colds nurtition Try theses Immune Boasting Foods Elderberry Button Mushrooms Acai berryOystersWatermelonCabbageAlmondsGrapefruitWheat germLow Fat YogurtGarlicSpinachGreenBlack Tea Sweet Potato and Broccoli and my favorite beets My Wife just said it could be stress and or associated the nerves so the BVitimins would be area to start I have to go Bye Steve  Debra I suffered from extreme anemia as well You may want to talk to her doctor about the iron infusions Those really are of more help than the actual iron supplement You probably need to take your ass to the doctor before you get Alzeimers in your sleep and throw up everywere and dont know what the hell your doing I took Paxil for over a year using the normal midrange dose for depression My physician and I discussed the continued need for Paxil and determined it was no longer necessary for me My physician designed an extensive program to very gradually stop Paxil to avoid any withdrawal and I followed it to the letter I am not prone to withdrawal from medications but we took no chances After very gradually tapering off over several weeks I quit using Paxil as planned Although we had taken every precaution I went through horrendous withdrawal for over a week Based on my experience with Paxil I would NEVER take this drug again It sounds to me like it is muscular skeletal But there are a number of conditions that could cause those type pains One could be related to a spinal condition but it could also be arthritic changes or Fibromyalgia You probably should see someone who will evaluate you for these issues Probably a Dr Who specializes in rheumatism or orthopedic conditions Tell your physician about it and he can send you to the right specialist Yes this is called L Hermittes sign and I have this symptom in my arms and legs Over time it has improved some but I still have the feeling of shocks if I move my neck quickly Hope this helps You may be eating certain things that could cause this Spicy or hot foods are more likely all the time going to give you heart burn  and BBQ such as meats and sauces Although this may be something more serious  Possibly may be Heart Disease or a sign of a Heart Attack Please consult your Physcian for a correct diagnosis as I am not the most smartest person in the world I suffer from anxietypanic for 30 years now Caffeine will definitely affect you depending on how much you use For me exercise helped but at the same time it did make my heart race and sometimes I talked myself into a full blown attack If you are healthy chalk it up to worrying or anticipating an attack Tinnitus can be a jaw joint or TMJrelated issue A dentist will do a complete examination which includes evaluating Changes in the degree to which you can open your mouth Deviations in opening and closing Clicks pops or pain A load test Xrays CT scans MRIs It also could be an ENT or neurological issue So you may want to see your physician for an exam as well I have tried heat and medications for the fibro flare ups but I dont know My wife has Devics disease and has these electric shocks everyday all over her body but mostly in her legs One option to consider is a chemical peel Dermatologists that are familiar with chemical peels use a combination of salicylic acid AHA and TCA to remove the top layer of the skin and encourage new skin growth Chemical peels can be very effective and are less costly than most laser treatments Neck lines and sagging neck are common complaints Most patients ignore their necks until they notice how aged their necks look The neck skin is fragile and requires more moisture than the face Just like you moisturize your face you should be moisturizing you neck Youll be glad that you did Plaque psoriasis needs to be addressed primarily by your physician Plaque psoriasis can be treated with topical and systemic medications There are also other treatments for plaque psoriasis without the possible side effects of systemic medications Ticks can carry Lyme disease which can cause major medical problems I would take himher in for testing You should still have her seen by a doctor Especially if you do not know what type of tick it is Do you know if it left a bull eye mark They can treat with antibiotic as a preventative if caught soon enough I would call your Dr Hi I have this too and my doctor said it was due to a thinning disk in your neck vertebre and it was pinching a nerve She said nothing can be done cause it was from me having RA and just old age Im 54 I hope you get help with this I know its painful and I cant even sleep Sometimes the pain meds dont work Tamara Hi I have Rheumatoid Arthritus I feel that way all the time and also feel an achyness all the time But I think you should go see a Rheumatologist and he can tell weather you have Osteoarthritus or RA Or even if your doctor does xrays and blood tests they can tell I hope you get better soon Tamara yes Yes it sure does Seven months ago my pulse went from around 55 to 65 count to over 200 beatsMy blood pressure was steady at the 120 over 60 I was on a 325 coated aspirin since my by pass in 1999 This sounds like a pinched nerve or possibly nerve damage CATMRI will be required for diagnosis well i thought this was a place where people could get some answers but apparently not I have had the same problem The sleep number bed with the memory foam overlay is best Although the pillow you use may be more important You need a good one that cradles your head and is slightly raised at the neck area Sleep number can help with that too My experience in care of COPD patients included use of steroids to decrease inflammation antibiotics to treat infection and nebulizer treatments to improve oxygen levels Assuming there are no drug allergies to those medications my instinctive answer would be that the treatment for COPD would not have had adverse effects on breathing I see several of the same patients over and over again because their condition can worsen with weather changes Most of them are in their late 60s 70s and 80s and have other chronic health conditions as well I would not want to make this response a CONCRETE YES as an answer without fully investigating past medical history and so on This is a GENERAL response only Difficulty breathing often accompanied by a feeling of tightness or heaviness in chest often causing more anxiety as a person fears they may be having a heart attack Also a panic attack manifests itself causing one to be more easily agitated or frustrated with simple things that would not normally bother them The person typically appears unable to sit still displays fear of something as they do not understand what is taking place and why they feel this sudden overwhelming rush of nervousness in them Tapping fingers pacing floors chewing nails appearing overly aggressive when irritated by little things swinging of feet or shaking of legs and feet The feeling could be easily compared to that adrenaline rush in the fight or flight response used as a means of keeping one safe under certain situations and conditions no possible infection of a tooth on that side or just simply your body actively fighting possible infection somewhere on that side how do you feel see any open soars tooth aches throat nose ear you should have finished them as your doctor advised you to Gargle with warm salt water and even gargle with hydrogen peroxide if the soars in your mouth do not show improvement I strongly suggest you seek medical attention to avoid further infection you most def already have and are battling right now I dont see any appropriate answer to this question besides keeping a close eye on the person mean while taking them to the ER They can be VERY serious and should be taken that way to avoid complications that could have been avoided keep them awake Welcome Here is some information on that may be helpful Id also like to ask if there is  As you can see there could be any number of things going on with you In order to get a diagnosis and

Its important not to let it wait too long sounds like a pinched nerve My daughter had that and it was from too much textingcomputer Is it in line with the ears right above where the soft part starts down the neck Marble size Bone hard If so its completely normal I have one and many other people do too Ive read you can trace your lineage to a certain region of the world if you have that bump And the old wives tale of bigger the bump smarter the person lol As one of member previously said light to throat and find any white or block dots if it is severe consult the doctor Most probably an impingement either on a tendon or other When blood flow is blockeddizziness quite common How long have you had it it could be a urinary track infection slip disk see Doctor see an orthopedic or a neurologist i would suggest tylenol and mucinex drink lots of water to thin out the mucus the tylenol will help with the other symptoms this could be a tension headache I have experienced the same thing  it is very scary The doctors attribute it to extreme acid reflux I am taking medication for the acid reflux and it helps however every now and then I eat more of a food I should eat in moderation  I overpower the medicine and once again have radiating pains in my chest throat and jaw Hope this helps  ask your doctor Good luck Neck pain is a symptom The causes can be muscular neurological or skeletal Have you seen a rheumatoid dr for testing It sounds like fibromyalgia which I have Mornings are the worst for me Most certainly not if you are female this could also be symptoms of heart problems such as coronary artery disease If you ARE STILL having these issues but only on an irregular basis I would definitely consult with a cardiologist I experienced the very same symptoms and only through my persistence and a caring doctor did he find that I had one artery that was 70 blocked While performing the angiogram the doctors also discovered I had an artery behind my heart with a 99 blockage and of course they fixed that first I had no idea something as simple as a painful neck such as the typical stress related pain could possibly be heart related in any way It then started to cause pain in my elbow and I thought I had twisted it doing something I received about 3 injections in it before the I started to experience other aches and pains normally attributed to aging issues but at 60 years old thought I was just showing more signs of the aging process I was fortunate enough to find a doctor that knew something had to be happening so I went through many tests that would always come back as normal although the symptoms remained The worst part was that I would never have consulted a heart specialist for any of my symptoms had another doctor ask me if I would mind seeing one of his colleagues A heart doctor for neck and elbow pain I thought it couldnt do any harm and when all tests came back as normal I thought I was wasting my time until they suggested an angiogramand I have to admit I was just as shocked as they were when they discovered the hidden blockage behind my heart that did NOT show on any of the tests they performed on me If you are female see a cardiologist and dont wait Usually they can change the medication or ad to it And since you mentioned that he has had a shock treatment I am sure he is suffering sever depression At this point with no results I would see another Dr And get a second opinion All these sympotm your are describing are common with anxietythey are uncomfortable at first but give the meds a chance to work and you will see that some and maybe all of these symptoms will go away in time May I suggest trying herbal supplements an maybe organic foods an see what happens Check with your ENT could be something to do with the sinus Sleep if you can try restful music or tv if you cant or a book My dr had told me it is normal to feel like that and symptoms of strep is swollen neck and lymph nodes I know i felt like i got hit by a truck for two days You Should See a doctor Just Because Its The Neck and the Spinal Cord area See a Doctor To Make Sure your Fall didnt damage any nerves it could be menopause some medications cause numbness some meds cause numbness You may have strained your ocular muscles I fell down the stairs in November and strained all my muscles Didnt know why my eyes hurt until February Dont wait get checked out I had similar symptoms and it was concerning enough for my doctor to put me into the hospital to run tests to check if I was having a heart attack Men and women can have different symptoms when they are having a heart attack Women in particular can have abdominal pain nausea and back pain when they are having a heart attack instead of the classic signs I hope this helps Let her know that what she is afraid of is not the worst thing in the world everyone gets sick and if you can get her to understand getting sick in front of everyone will not kill her and she wouldnt be the first she probably will not get sick have her imagine what she is most afraid of and the most likely resposnse of those around her Chances are she has visions much worse than reality and can understand that I lay on the edge of the bed on my back Hubby stands next to bed and pulls me towards him if your husband is tall you can use pillows to adjust height My husband has a bad back and this is a good position for him alsofor oral sex I sit on the floor or pillow with my back against the bed This supports my neck get second opinion from nerophysician I do that all the timeeven in bed GO SEE A CHIROPRACTOR I wouldnt want to live without one since I started seeing one Usually a quick adjustment to the neck is all it takes Also ice packs to the area help with the pain For the past three months I have been experiencing pain in my upper left arm muscle It is constant Also pain in my gums in my upper left jaw This has been checked by an endodontist I also have the same sort of pain in my knees but not constant I am obese 240 but have low blood pressure and cholesterol I also take care of my 95 year old mother now and have to stay on the move In this past three months I have also had sinus trouble sneezing and thick gunk in my throat  nasal passage I have not been treated for a sinus infection There was also a bout of diarrhea  breaking out in sweats which lasted 24 hours I dont seem to have a temperature though I also have sleep apnea and COPD I quit smoking 11112011 Someone suggested that I could have had a heart attack because of the pain in my upper left arm I was just wondering what the symptoms of heart attack are for women I dont seem to feel any stress on my heart There is no pain in that area I used to have a very physical job delivering heavy boxes etc and I suppose I could have injured my upper left arm or shoulder somehow but I retired in 1994 Im just wondering if I could have had a heart attack Thank you I am interested in this What did they say or do that made U think they would not see your daughter Why did they say they would not see her Tell us the rest of the story You need to take in more calories than you are burning You can reference an online caloric intake calculator It will tell you how many calories you need depending on your activity level You can get the excess calories from protein shakes and meal replacement shakes If this doesnt seem to help it could be a sign that there is something possibly wrong in your body and your fast metabolism is just a symptom you could have hyperthyroidism or something else and may need to consult a doctor In short 1 Eat more food if this doesnt work talk to a doctor It sounds similar to some sensations I get from FibromylagiaIf the sensation is like a burn and it makes it hard to move your muscles sometimes I would do some research on other fibromylagia symptoms and see if it matches up Good luck This also happens to my girlfriend the doctor told her she needed more iron in her blood this worked but whenever she stopped taking iron pills she got dizzy and had headaches again so probably a good diet with lots of iron No that I know of I had that issue a number of years ago and based on the recommendations of my personal doc and the speciaist she referred I had the procedure that removed it and cleared my sinuses unbelievably well Sore swollen neck near my wind pipe on my left side None at all First I validate the fear ie I know you are terrified Being dismissive might intensify their fears Then I listen to the fears Usually the person is aware the fear is some freefloating irrational or undefinable feeling Then I begin reassuring the person that it will end just hang in there I usually hold their hand or stroke their back Like some have said breathing into a paper bag works well for most people A tranquilizer works quickly Any facts you can give them also is calming I list the symptoms and potential solutions so they know what to and what not to expect I say things like Its okay it sounds like youre having an anxiety attack It will pass It will not kill you It is not a heart attack They come on suddenly and they can leave just as suddenly You will find your way home that seems to the one of the symbolic underlying fears Im here with you This wont last forever It will end You are safe One thing that seems to help more than anything is to have the person do a physical activity right there in the moment Yoga as one person suggested would be wonderful if the situation allows it Breathing in the bag is another good one But any task that forces concentration back to the moment puts them in touch with reality Its nearly impossible to give energy to the fear when one is doing a physical task And lastly I have discovered that caffeine often triggers an attack Too much coffee tea soda etc often is the culprit So you might want to ask them if they ingested a good deal of caffeine an hour or more before the attack If so they may have a caffeine allergy I hope this helps i do not have a herniated disc I dont know but would like to find out i am better on zoloft but something is still not right i think a natural source is better to try but i want to be safe so can someone please tell me no The bad thing about ticks is that they feed off of all kinds of disgusting animals with that being said you need to go to the doctor because ticks can carry Lyme disease and it is dangerous go to the doc and have them take a look because Lyme disease can cause death if it gets bad in your case just sounds like a bacterial infection from that nasty tick either way go to the doc thats my best advice hope i helped  My right side shoulder has pain that makes it hard to turn my neck I think its kinda permenant  but try exfoliation and use an emolient  its one of those changes that happen after pregnancy this could be psycogenic with her going through menopause  but doctors should also have some lung investigation some lung disorders cause pain thats radiated to the abdomen I have had tendonitis and bursitis in my shoulders for several years now causing pain in my shoulders neck and upper back I get severe headaches lightheadedness and dizziness that according to my doctor and chiropractor are directly related to the pain I have in my shoulders From my understanding it is pinched nerves that actually cause me to get lightheaded and dizzy It is important to note that I also have neck pain stemming from a side to side whiplash injury from an auto accident 12 years ago I believe its one of those questions which came first the chicken or the egg So Im curious if you also have neck pain IF you have neck pain from an accident or injury I would definitely recommend getting seen for that as well I would also recommend seeing either a neurologist or an orthopedic surgeon or both to see if there are any remedies for the cause of your pain I just had an arthrogram done a specialized MRI on my shoulder and have finally discovered that I have several large bone spurs on my shoulder rotator cuff and collar bone that surgery can fix I am NOT a person who jumps into surgery but after years of suffering I and my doctors feel that it is the last option available to finally get some relief I wish you good luck in finding the cause and hopefully a remedy for your pain and lightheadedness I am a FIRM believer that pain is our body telling us that something is wrong and we should NEVER ignore it This sounds like either pinched nerve in your neck or maybe even fibromyalgia You need to get this checked out It can be caused by many things I had vertigo from a medication I was on once The ER doctor asked me if the room felt like it was spinning or did I feel like I was spinning He explained that usually if the cause is from the neck up inner ear ear infection etc you will feel like the room is spinning and if the cause is from the below the neck such as cardiac issues you feel like youre spinning Some of your symptoms are also those of diabetes If the room is spinning you can take Meclizine OTC check with a pharmacist if you are taking other medications If the problem is inner ear or an ear infection this should help your symptoms If it doesnt help or your symptoms get worse you should probably see a doctor to rule out more serious conditions No you dont need to I have always been an excitable anxious child  adult  have experienced 5 panic attacks mostly due to a relationship problem you need to go to your Dr  tell them councilling very good also  anti anxiety drugs also  maybe a low dose antidepressant hope this helps sounds like swollen lympnoids sign of infection hUsBaNd wIfE dIvOrCe 919829717996 LoVe

been taking for the past 2 months They dehydrate the crap out of me if I dont drink at least 814 big glasses of water a day which in turn causes painful headaches Thought maybe this could be a symptom of the dehydration as well I can consult with one of the physicians that I work with I just dont want to waste their time if this is just a symptom of being stressed anyone have any ideas thoughts opinions Mac The cautionary statements here are for real Its not just the return of depression or anxiety symptoms that youre facing here Your doctor can help you taper off gradually to avoid the worst of the discontinuation effectsYou dont want to do this without the help of your doctors office httpwwwwebmdcomdepressionguidewithdrawalfromantidepressants Symptoms most often occur within three

Vomiting Carma Paxil Paroxetine is a commonly prescribed SSRI the category that doctors often start with when prescribing antidepressants Some of these SSRIs benefit people with anxiety and panic attack symptoms Please tell your doctor how the Paxil benefitted you years ago and whether your current prescription is working for you It is not unusual for people to report that one of these drugs works better for them than the others Your personal experience is the best information your doctor can get in treating you httpwwwwebmdcomdepressionhowdifferentantidepressantswork

rednesswhite patches in throat try Take care health at walgreens or minute clinic at CVS their prices seem to be reasonable Most services at walgreens are only 5999 I recently used walgreens for what ended up being a skin infection in the outside of my right earwhich only cost me 20 for visit and 5 for prescription since I had insurance without would have only been 89 for visit My son went through this same thing when he was younger the doctor ran all sorts of tests and did the IV antibiotics and no change If your daughter is sleeping a lot along with the other symptoms have her doctor check for mono disease This is what my son was diagnosed with and it took a month and a half after diagnoses for it to go away Also try the mixture of ibuprofen and Tylenol together for the fever I hope she feels better soon Good luck Alcohol can cause high blood pressure and high blood pressure does make you look and feel flushed Do you have any kind of a rash Like pimples or blisters If thats the case It might be shingles You can go for following exercises that are given below  Press Ups  pressup exercises are helpful for leg and back pain Lie on stomach with your arms bent and palms on the floor Extension Exercises  Lie on your stomach with the arms and legs stretched out Raise one arm and the opposite leg holding them in this position for 3 seconds Lower them to the ground repeating the same movement with the other limbs CurlUp Exercises  The curlup exercises strengthen the abdominal muscles which will provide support for the back relieving the pain Leg Raise  The leg raise exercises are

the heart unless he is allergic to penicillin then i would suggest a different antibiotic i could be wrong but ask your family doctor before doing so just for a back up answer No you dont Ive had anxiety for a year now and have only experienced two panic attacks Anxiety is mainly just a type of feeling people get Some have it more serious others dont Sometimes when they do a lumbar puncture it can cause some of the spinal fluid to leak a bitI know it happened to me and it caused me to have a headache for about a week afterwards I just treated it as best I could and eventually the symptoms went away However if youre still suffering after a week I would go to your regular doctornot the ER Tell him what you had done and let him know what symptoms youre still experiencing That way he can see what the results are from your previous tests and maybe order more accordingly Good luck  \t \t \t \t \t \t\t \t\tBODYDIVTABLETHEADTBODYTFOOTTRTHTDP  fontfamilyArial fontsizexsmall  \t\t Looking

vessels in the body become harder and lost flexibility I am not a cocaine user even once so I do not concern about its effect no Talk to your doctor about the symptoms you are experiencing If they cant find a common medication they could make a combination medication to target all of your problems It could get expensive though just be mindful Insurance companies do not like to pay for compound medications And not a lot of pharmacies do these kind of medications but none the less it is possible Not everyone is the same nor does everyone respond to the same things So discuss your options vigorously with your doctor My experience was an allergic reation to an antbiotic I was eventually diagnosed with exfoliative erythroderma It took a about two months and a ten day hosptal stay to get that diagnosis The longer no action was taken the worse the condition got My reconmendation is to persue this untill you have a finite action plan My diagnosis came from a dermotologist that was recomended and arranged by my allergy and asthma doctor Treatment was long over a year and I experienced many complications i have chronic mononucleosis and have all these symptoms but i usually have a fever for about a week before i have another attack Its what feels right to you Personally running helped me a lot Swimming on the other hand did not Yoga was challenging but I just didnt get the same results I did after a hard run When I run I feel empower after and even if Im on the edge of having a panic attack when I leave the house I can chase that feeling away Ive avoided quite a few panic attacks by running Ive been having less of them too I started to work out everyday and now Im having less panic attacks Just try different things out Try yoga try running try walking try workout apps Whatever makes you feel better is the best exercise Im not a doctor but running has been helping me so I thought Id chime in I think you will be okay Its not like you actually had their blood on your hands and Ive never heard of blood dried on paper harming anyone Take a deep breath you are going to be okay I suffered from vitiligo for three years It first grows out on my neck and then spreads to my face which makes me look awful I dont like the way that strangers look at me I tried many treatments such as laser surgery to remove it but it really just can cure the symptoms on the surface months later I found it still grows out on my neck This really bothers me and makes me lack of confidence However things turn better when one of my mothers relatives in China told me to try some Chinese herbs He invited us to go to China to receive the treatment First i just want to have a trip which i thought will makes me feel happier On the other side I dont believe those Chinese Traditional stuff sounds like witchcrafts to me However magics really happened on me After the treatment I do get better now They use some secret prescriptions from the ancient time and pure Chinese herbs that dont have side effects Anyways I m so glad to share this story with people that have same problems like me Hope you can have a try too Here is some information about this hospitalwebsitehttpwwwvitiligotcmcom emailcurevitiligoaliyuncom Could be Migraine however check with your doctor just to be sure and safe Thanks I had the same symtoms Mine started behind my right ear then in my neck and shortly later in my shoulder and down my arm But after a year pain started on my left shoulder and arm My hands and fingers started going numb and tingling My first MRI showed a little disc bulge Couple of years later the MRI showed stenosis I had surgery Helped but a year and half later I got internal scar tissue and I have stenosis from that which is displacing the spinal cord So now Im worst than I was So good luck Also an MRI always doesnt show the problem until it becomes bad I think there are other tests that can help Or maybe you need another pathogist to read Your MRI AND see a Orthopaedic specialist and get on a payment plan It could be a number of things Since it includes difficulty to swallowing I wouldnt keep putting it off Get it checked out I dont think ENTs will bill you they will more than likely want to pay up front and that can get expensive At least the ER will bill you If it bothers you to swallow that tube is right by the tube you use to breathe It might be a food allergy or sensitivity My cheeks and ears get red and hot after I eat wheat but also sometimes randomly I think its probably a dye and additive that makes me flush on the nonwheat times Have you tried keeping a food journal thats really for a phd but i can tell you my mothers si joint was a off and on kind of problem that she only gets relief from those injections steroid injections  Tension headachesmigraines and if they are bad enough they could cause nausea and vomiting and sensitivity to light Migraines can be one sided Massage therapist or chiropractic visits are helpful Putting ice packs to the back of the neck is also helpful I find sitting up in my recliner in a dark room is more helpful than lying down you may want to look into Vertigo my mother was just diagnosed with this and had a lot of the same symptoms Shell go for days without an episode then all of a sudden shes dizzy off balance and she ended up hurting herself fairly badly when she fell and hit her head Id suggest going to the doctor asap if youre able Possibly Irlen Syndrome also known as Scotopic Sensitivity Syndrome Self test at irlencom you can also look up screeners in your area to find out If you were not feeling panicked or overwhelmed at the time of the episode it may not be a panic attack and you may want to talk with your doctor a panic attack doesnt always have to be paralyzing there are different levels of panic attacks whatever is causing your spells I hope that you get better The main answer that I can think of is its your nerves It can be just stress related Have you been under more stress the past two or more months You could be suffering from anxiety andor depression and not even realize it No that does not mean that you are psychotic or look and behave just like the people in those antidepressant commercials either If you look those conditions up you may find many symptoms that match not just your pain but possibly other symptoms you may be experiencing too There is also the possibility that it could be nerve pain I suggest that you take some time to think about not just the pain you are feeling but also what other problems are you experiencing You should talk to your doctor about the pain and anything else that is bothering you andor maybe causing you to behave unusual to others around you You may also be having problems with circulation You should just go see your doctor an if youre the type to forget what you thought about wanting to ask then think about what you want to ask and discuss the day you set the appointment write it down or even write down everything you want to say and bring it with you Well I hope you do find out what is causing you that discomfort and get some relief If you want to you can let me know what you found out Your shocks can absolutely positively be caused by your MS I get the sensation of being tasered from my elbows through my hands These shocks have literally lifted me inches off the couch or bed they are so powerful I spent 10 days in the hospital with an EEG and 6 months later on an ambulatory EEG at home Seizures were ruled out So great once again I find out what its not The best answer I get is that they are a complication of MS The still hurt like hell though it could be costochondritis which is difficult to diagnose it isnt life threatening just annoying ear nose and throat Vertigo is usually caused by to much fluid in the inner ear The main symptom of pleurisy is pain in the chest This pain often occurs when you take a deep breath in or out or cough Some people feel the pain in the shoulderDeep breathing coughing and chest movement makes the pain worsePleurisy can cause fluid to collect inside the chest cavity This can make breathing difficult and may cause the following symptoms Bluish skin color cyanosis Coughing Shortness of breath Rapid breathing tachypnea Pleurisy may develop when you have lung inflammation due to infections such as pneumonia or tuberculosis This inflammation also causes the sharp chest pain of pleurisyIt may also occur with Asbestosrelated disease Certain cancers Chest trauma Pulmonary embolus Rheumatoid arthritis Lupus COPIED FROMhttpwwwncbinlmnihgovpubmedhealthPMH0002347 sounds like it could also be kindey stones  either way if the pain gets worse or of u begin to have pain when u pee call the doctor  if u have fear to go maybe justa consult can let u know weither its something to go in for  hope u feel better dont know but if its giving him pain i would go see the doctor about it  may first make a call to the doctor he may tell you a few things that can help make it go away  has he had it long is he 100 sure that he wasent hit on the head  you know boys will be boys  i think only if he has pain is it really something to worry about  hope this helps your mouth is full of nerves and just because you have pain in one place doesnt mean thats where its coming from i would make a check up with your dentest if it doesnt let up  and infection can live in your gums  which is very bad since it can cause an abcest which can go into the spin and brain if left untreated can lead to death  on the lighter side a little meds can clear that right up  hope you feel better and hope this helped  sound like it possible your having pinched nerves which when the area is stressed is iving you the numbness  the puffiness its possible because the area has some problem when you use it which its kinda hard not to causes the area to become swollen i think it something to get checked out by your doctor  neck pain really blows  i have a reversed cervial spine so i know how it can stop your whole life i would ask for a mri cause it doesnt sound like a bone problem  hope this helps depending on how bad it can go from headaches  toothaches blurred vision in very bad cases  inablity to focus  finfing it hard to think pain in your jaw due to something like your cervical spine not being in the right place ex reversed cervical spine which causes the bones to be as it says in the name reversed which i myself have and its very painfull after you spine curves more than a 20 degree angle in the wrong direction  also things like bad posture can cause neck pain  if you sit on front of a computer for a long tome each day i hope this helps you  sounds to me like you might have shingles check it out pronto The test would be conclusive at that time However the HIV virus can take some time before being able to show up on a test Getting tested again wouldnt hurt Once every 6 months to a year is ideal especially if you are continuing to have sex with sex workers I wouldnt freak out too much yet though Many things can cause swollen lymph nodes including a sinus infection I used to get headaches in my sleep too First its helpful if you are not dehydrated or still digesting food at 11 pm and beyond because your serotonin is produced then if you dont have food allergies and sensitivities biofeedback is a great way to get a full panel then I might recommend finding a upper cervical chiropractor NUCCCA is their title so you can look them up that way I feel great when I wake up now Hope that helps Take him to a doctor as soon as possible Ticks carry lyme disease Better safe than sorry yes any strenuous exercise for a long period will deplete your bodies electrolytes and should be replaced YES The fact that you are asking that question and you lost consciousness it warrants a trip to the ER I had a fall a month ago and hurt my neck and shoulders it was a fall down a rocky hill I have the shooting pain down both arms and into the fingers I have already waited longer to return to dr than I should have Cholesterol bad diet Eat less fatty foods 0 Based upon my personal experience along with my husband daughter and now hundreds of people that I have come to know through a variety of venues I am a professional counselor with 30 years of experience your symptoms can absolutely be attributed to persistent borrelia Lyme infection and perhaps coinfections I strongly recommend you review the International Lyme and Associated Diseases ILADS website for uptodate and accurate information Because of what comes down to what is now willful ignorance many doctors are poiltical hacks rather than physicians like the expert who gave you horrible advice on this forum may need to see Chiropractor mine does at times and one day Ill deep breath and pops on its on I have Peripheral Artery Disease I got it in my late 40s due to blood coagulation problem I also had very high cholesterol over 300 my entire life I had difficulty walking by age 50 I put myself on high dose nattokinase and serrapeptase and the symptoms disappeared within 6 weeks You will know it is working within 1 month I eat as much cholesterol as I want I have been on this over 6 years I am on maintenance dose Just experiment with dosage over time to get the minimum dose and cost Please be aware that conventional medicine perpetuates lies about cholesterol Just take the time to look at the studies If the arteries are clean enough you wont have heart disease Ignore the cholesterol propaganda They have Nattokinase made from bacteria and fungus with and without vitamin K Both work but I prefer the Nattokinase with Vitamin K Without vitamin K is for people on prescriptions drugs I take Best Nattokinase and Serrapeptase I buy from Swanson vitamin because they are cheap iIm amazed they dont have Heart disease category for this Chinese have done thousands of

fibrolytic enzymes for heart attack and stroke prevention my advise would be go to the er if it doesnt get better because these can be signs of a stroke or something else Ive been a physical therapist for over 25 years For some reason people still think that massage and ultrasound is primarily what we use for treatment That may have been true 20 or 30 years ago but the therapists I know and have worked with in recent years do very little ultrasound especially for neck pain Most massage has been turned over to massage therapists as well We often use a lot of specific exercise techniques to stretch or strengthen the region manual techniques like joint mobilizations or manipulation etc We do use both mechanical and manual traction some electrical modalities dry needling taping and other techniques We also use heat or cold but to categorize what our profession does these days as heat ultrasound and massage what we disparaging call a HUM job is illinformed and insulting shoulder pain problems shoulder pain problems I had a positive lymph node on my neck one that is enlarged for at least a month and had it removed and biopsied The local small town pathologist told me I either had HIV cancer or lymesReally narrowed that down eh So he sent my node to Cornell University to the top lymph node doc in the country thats what he said and the report came back Toxoplasmosis Its a parasite thats harmless unless youre pregnant Im just saying the possibilities are many most are harmless Just make sure your specimen goes to a qualified pathologist Good luck  Well Im not an orthopod but a retired xray tech of 42 years Small bones like in the hands and feet start to mend produce new bone growth in about 7 to 10 days its evident on xraysIts called callus formation Its not mended but starting to evident on xrays Its considered a common event that small bones even ribs are pretty much healed in 23 weeks but they give you a few weeks more just for good measure Large bones in 68 weeks But per your question new bone growth is pretty much evident on xrays in as little as 2 weeks Im guessing if the bone fragments are in close proximity to each other Just my opinion Hope this helps Just opinion here but maybe its not bacterial or maybe its MRSA Have to consider viral or fungal infection If so then antibiotics would be ineffective Think outside the box Is this a person that has had numerous antibiotics thru their life Our society believes you should get antibiotics for everything whether they are indicated or not Maybe try antifungal or antiviral med if nothing else is working Immune system is probably compromised already so last ditch might be steroids Just thinking to myself Hope this helps Bless you You could have low blood sugar or low blood pressure You might need to go to the doctor for some blood tests Also i have the same problem too The doctor told me it could be my medication for my thyroid condition No The ball of my foot is hurting really bad Im not a medical professional but you should get to the dentist or doctor immediately The infection can spread to your eye or worse I have seen it happen Please get help now Doesnt seem to me personally like anything to worry about but you never can be to safe my hands and legs have been tingling and my right side has a pain can not move or cough it hurts Let me say again not a node its doesnt swell or become soar if i get sick it has nothing to do with being sick its always there the same size just like the first bump i describes my final bump i just noticed the other day Its kind of under my tounge another word i cant spell or on the floor of my mouth but just where my hard gum line meets the soft floor of my mouthIt stick out a little bit and is annoying I looked online for a long time in search of my most recent bump but most of what i found there were multiple conjoining bumps Either way Im freaked out as I see some pretty crazy stuff online yet none of it completely descibes me try using more pillows to elevate your head so you do not have to resort to sleeping in recliner Maybe you should get your nerves tested I had a neck injury that was not visible from my MRI and CAT scans and was effecting my right arm I was feeling nerve pain down my right arm and tingling at my fingertips and also had weakness in my arm When I injured myself my spine pinched my nerve that runs down my arm Because there are so many tick born ailments I think its important that you watch her closely for the next week or so Make sure you take temp 2xs a day and watch for rashes anywhere on the body Stiffness in neck when really bad cannot bend neck in any direction Feels swollen affects jaw and ears Causes tightness in muscles of cranium and pain and stiffness from area of neck near the base of cranium and spine  Very stiff and horrid pressure in mid to upper spine is a main contributor as well Hearing loss in right ear is almost completeLeft ear is losing hearing as well Every nerve on my upper torso muscular rigidity or atrophy happens in both shoulders with pain running under armpits causing numbness in both arms Confusion the inability to speak is very frustrating When I feel frustrated with this pain I cannot express any emotion almos like I am in a walking coma Nerves on my skin hurt so much it is painful to shower All the while my neck continues to stay stiff and feel like a knuckle feels when it needs to pop and sometimes the neck does pop but it isnt the bones that pop its the muscles that pop Right before they pop the muscles in the neck sound rusty Yes they make a sound like an old leather baseball glove would make if you opened or closed the glove Last but not least the taste in my mouth is horrendous It feels like the nerves in my mouth have been muted or are hurt stinging some way I dont know if the taste is coming from the drainage from my right ear Which gets filled with so muhch pressure the ear drum breaks chronically and then heals up until pressure gets bad again While the ear drum is still unbroken the drainage runs down my throat making my throat sore and giving me that horrible taste and stinging in my mouth  That I am not for sure of I have a friend that also has the same condition She says she gets pain in and around face and neck area tender and painful I want to believe she said does swell sometimes The ER here in MS was also not familiar with it They thought she said fibro and its not the fibro Not sure wh ya lot of places havent heard of it You may want to look it up on mayo clinic online May give you some better insight I know a doctor in I think was Florida was doing some kind or laser treatment without surgery My friend has said that they also call it suicide disease httpwwwmayocliniccomhealthtrigeminalneuralgiaDS00446DSECTIONsymptoms here is the link to symptoms right on site check it out is exactly how she described it to me Could possibly be sinus infection Take some of the new Advil allergy and congestion pills available Box is yellow and green says New at top Other than that possibly need to go to doctor or clinic or er Not sure if hay fever but I get the same feelings Advil allergy and congestion will work for hay fever too Better to try then not to You only get I think 10 pills for 600 and I buy them at DG store Dollar Store One every 46 hours as needed Try it other than that I dont know I fell that people experience anxiety in many different ways In your case one might say that the stress your homework can entail might subsequently trigger a specific chemically cranial process making you experience panic or anxiety due to the situation I would say that anxiety related to school is quite common I personally experience immense anxiety when I have to give presentations for schoolsomewhat a similar situation Hope I could help you out This is my first answer haha no as long as they are not red around the area and not itching you should be safe I think you should get it checked or take a picture of it to see if it changes you should have saved the tick also watch for a bullseye shape mark that would be bad well you need to see your family physician first then shehe will refer you to whom ever they think is fit for you Are you female Over 40 or no ovaries Could be menopause yes go to the dr to remove prevent further infection  About 2010 I got a concussion when I fell while I was a patient in the hospital strangely enough I did not at that time have vestibular issues But I do now Its very frustrating when youre doing the PT for vestibular and still have the symptoms  I passed out without any warning Stood up and 30 seconds later passed out again Both times I landed on my face But I was unconscience before I even hit the floor Doctors were thinking it likely was seizures The last time I had a seizure was approx 1985 But I have been taking my medicine to prevent them for many years Could it be possible that switching to a newer drug Antivert may be to blame I dont know why my neurologist made me switch After all if it aint broke dont fix it According to him Dilantin is a very old medicine I have gone back to taking Dilantin But I am getting therapy for vestibular as a result of the episodes BTW is there a difference between dizzy and lightheaded  Hot flashes I a 48 yearold man get them I dont know if mine are caused by all of the bipolar meds that I take I would love to get an answer as well because I have been experiencing the same sensation for a few weeks I feel it in my upper chest near my neck face and ears Those areas get read and blotchy and feel hot to the touch It last a few minutes and then goes away It burns feels prickly and after a while slightly itchy The burning is the worst part of it because it feels like a terrible sunburn I sure hope we get some answer You might need a chiropractor to relieve the pins and needlesnumbness  If you are tired all the time get checked for lyme disease  I had it for years and did not know it until I could not move anymore  If you dont take omega 3s and 6s essential fatty acids you can become very tired so add this to your diet If you have had lyme disease and did not take antibiotics until you were symptom free it will return  I know it happened to me because I could not get treatment I needed because of lack of knowledge from infectious disease doctors  long term lyme disease required IV antibiotics to penetrate the underlying tissues  you need to see a lyme literate doctor who has success in treating lyme disease  wwwiladsorg Not usually but the after effects do If youre experiencing a sort of negative excitement feeling in your chest like the feeling we get if we hear a big bang and are anticipating a dramatic scene occurring THAT feeling in your chest with shortness of breath but not as dramatic as a full blown attack close enough though then its just considered anxiety Nerve damage in your neck Pulled muscles in your neck Either way if you are continually getting headaches you need to see your doctor I have this exact problem Good luck Here is a great slide show from the site that might help you identify it It is definitely safe You want to be careful to see how they interact with each other at a time when you can lay down if necessary I take four 1 mg Xanax a day and two 75325 mg of Norco hydrocodone everyday Make sure your doctors are aware of your medical history and all medications Sounds like you are experiencing sleep apnea If you are waiting up not being able to breath it is most likely that i would discuss your plans with your doctor that is prescribing you the ativan He should be able to slowly ween you off of them or offer you an alternative that is safer for you and your child You say that you sleep all night and are still tired the next day I had this problem for years and it turned out that I have sleep apnea Sleep apnea interferes with REM sleep and though it seems that you sleep all night you are waking up a lot Sleep deprivation due to sleep apnea or for any other reason can cause an imbalance in leptin and grehlin These hormones affect appetite I would eat a big supper and in an hour I was physically hungry again and wanting to eat another full meal I gained 15 pounds in about 3 months before I got treatment for the apnea You might ask your doctor to assess you for sleep apnea or other sleep problems As I am not a doctor I wont even speculate on what injury or issue you may be having However you may try having an MRI done that was how I found out I had herniated the c5c7 vertebrae in my neck in a car crash since she is diabetic you have to rule out hypoglycemic headace get a GRBS tested if GRBS is less than 60 mg ask her to take some sugar or candy treatment for gastritis can also be given A neck xray can rule out cervical spondilitis  Seek medical attention now This could be related to a more serious condition rather than just a headache Because your headache presents itself when you lie down this could be tumor related I had the same symptom for 3 months When I finally went in and they did a CT Scan I had a Primary Brain Tumor You might have high blood pressure Have you had your thyroid checked I was having pain and stiffness right posterior neck and subscapular muscle spasms After taking 25mcgm of synthroid the pain stiffness and spasms went away It could be the mattress itself the positioning of your body whilst sleeping or the material the pillows are made from I would say to invest in another mattress or try sleeping somewhere else to see what happens Your neck is greatly affected by the positioning of your body The same thing happened to me and when I had an MRI done they determined that I had a herniated disc The simplistic answer is the the panic attack is the furthest extension of the anxiety When the anxiety is really bad it forces the autonomic systems of the body automaticbreathing heart rate blood pressure adrenaline release etc to react in the extreme and you can move into a panic attack It can happen very quickly and be totally disabling even acting exactly like a heart attack make you think wildly change normal behavior to bizarre want to run hide hurt yourself and more Panic attacks are not anything to ignore If you are prone to them you should always have a fast acting med with you such as Xanax Take it move to a quiet calm place and regain composure They are frightening and terrifying Best of luck I think cottage cheese tastes so gross So I feel your pain I found a tick on my penis back in the summer How it got there I have no clue Anyway I removed it and a small bump remained I suspect it was the ticks head still imbedded in my skin and the bump was my body slowly absorbing it Yes its disgusting and frightening to think of a parasite attaching itself to my genitals but ultimately the bump went away in about a week or so with no lasting effects No Lyme disease Youre probably OK but you could always go to the doctor for advice just so he or she can inform you about what symptoms of Lyme disease to look for "}
