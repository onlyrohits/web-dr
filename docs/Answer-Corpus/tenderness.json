{"text": "it could mean that you are pregnantbetter go to your doctor and do a test and make sure IDENTICAL SYMPTOMS appeared in my ankle preceding a bite from a Black Widow spider in the topIfoot The actual bite she gave was ABSOLUTELY PAINLESS I am going to be a mommy and I did ent have sex and my docture told my mom so yes you can How big are their nipples Perhaps its time for them to start wearing some sort of bra How much exercise do they regularly get Im a guy and Im in pretty great shape but if I run for a few hours a day every day after taking several weeks off my nipples can get sore from my shirt I imagine it could be the very same problem for a very young girl depending on how much and what type of exercise theyre getting Oh swimming pool  how long did they have their swimming suits on for Probably just a contact rash from having that wet cloth rubbing on their skin as they played around during the day A hematoma occurs when blood leaks out of the blood vessel into adjacent tissue areas When a hematoma occurs as I remember from emergency medicine training the principles associated in the acronym  R I C E may be applied as follows R Rest I Ice C Compression and E Elevation You should consider a 2nd medical evaluation if the hematomas appears to be infected hemorrhaging of blood occurs if your dad is taking a blood thinner and bleeding will not stop or if the affected tissue area has not returned to its previous state of being within 46 weeks after first noting the hematomas It can take a month or longer for this type of condition to completely resolve itself My Conclusion Save the pain and tenderness it seems that dad should have a total recovery from his hematoma condition in a rather uneventful manner Of course it is always a judgment call when to seek medical treatment In the case of a 80 year old man your advocacy and good judgment are critical ingredients to his continued safety and quality of health Im inclined to play it safe and not delay in re seeking treatment when the least bit of medical uncertainty exists I hope that this answer has been helpful and your dads recovery is swift and complete My answer is meant to be constructive and not intended as a judgmental criticism by labeling your condition as being caused by alcohol abuse You could be experiencing a condition called alcoholic neuropathy  The symptoms as you describe them may be signs of nerve damage which can be permanent If you stop drinking your pain and the tenderness feelings may diminish due to an improved nutritional balance within the body Besides terminating your alcohol intake through approved treatment methods Detox Rehabilitation Talk Therapy Medications 12 Step AA Program Involvementetc  taking B vitamins such a B12 and Thiamin and seeing a neurologist are advisable steps to be taken You can stop drinking alcohol and prevent other serious medical problems This is best accomplished by being vigorously honest with yourself and seeking addiction help I wish you well I dont have your exact answer but if you have a smartphone you can download an app called Period Tracker that will keep track of your cycle symptoms intimacy dates and ovulation There is also a Pregnancy Mode that will track your pregnancy  i had a hysterectomy a yr ago I dont knowIm going through something similar and dont know whats going on First day of last period was 223 ovulated last week supposedly we are trying to get pregnant Then on Wednesday 313 I started bleeding and cramping for last 4 days Lower back ache and tired Three pregnancy tests were Negative Never been pregnant before Hadnt been on pill for over 8 years Im supposed to get my period in a week from now supposedly What is happening  For your any dental problem click here  confidentdentalcare You could be If you have a normal 28 day cycle you would of ovulated around the 15th if you had unprotected sex around that day you could of conceived Id say take a home pregnancy test if still negative ask your dr for another blood test Good luck to you  It sounds like to be like some sort of cyst Especially the way you describe it You should see your Doctor about it and he may be able to tell you what it is or help with a prescription Has your diet or sex play changed recently See your doctor if this continues for a few months Regardless of your age clothes rubbing on your nipples can cause irritation My wife was having the same problem I suggested clear double sided tape As crazy as it sounds it worked I know a woman who started to produce milk and was not pregnant She said her husband would suck on them for long periods of time nightafternight She felt them getting heavy and increased 2 cup sizes Dont know if this can happen to all women or not Your doctor should be able to determine the cause Sorry youre going through this Some people are prone to developing  and its not a pleasant process to go through If you are not running a fever you can probably take a waitandsee attitude toward the situation A fever is indicative of an infection though a localized skin infection may not cause much of a fever Drainage is good when it comes to cysts so you can try applying very warm compresses to the area to help draw out the remaining fluid The white head youre seeing could be a layer of skin cells regrowing to cover the opening Although you can gently scrub the skin to keep the cyst open we generally discourage people from doing this because you dont want to inadvertently introduce infection to the area Speaking of which you also can apply antibacterial ointment to the area to reduce the chances of the wound becoming infected Its not unusual for a large sebaceous cyst to take several days to completely drain after it has burst on its own Assuming youre not allergic to any overthecounter pain remedies you can take ibuprofen or acetaminophen for the pain If you continue to have concerns about the cyst or if it emits a smelly greenish pus or if you start running a fever then its time for a trip to the doctor Its not necessarily an emergency but Id recommend you call your primary health care provider if the situation gets worse or doesnt clear up over the next several days Wishing you well In all probability what youre experiencing is simply irritation and dryness of the nipple which can be fixed by applying moisturizer That said the full answer is a bit more complicated The fact youre having pain throughout the whole breast presents something of a red flag Id suggest you see your primary care provider to have this more fully evaluated Obviously you dont want to take any chances that this is something more serious that just dry skin Even if youve had normal mammograms in the past tenderness in the breast is something to get evaluated With luck it will turn out to be something simple but youll get some peace of mind by having your health care provider evaluate this Good luck to you So sorry to hear youre dealing with this Pain is never fun The symptoms youre describing could be caused by several things ranging from injury striking your hand against an object for example to repetitive motion strain such as from using a video game controller for hours on end Treating the symptoms may be based in part on what is causing them so your best bet is to get checked out by your primary care provider He or she will evaluate the problem possibly order some tests Xray for example and then develop an appropriate treatment plan for you So while this certainly isnt an emergency situation it would be a good idea to have this problem checked out before it gets any worse Good luck to you Im sorry youre having concerns about your incision Sometimes they can be a bit slower to heal than wed like I cant give you specific instructions because I dont know what type of closure you had for your incision staples sutures stitches glue Dermabond steristrips the little tape pieces etc Each type of closure can require a different type of postsurgery care What I can tell you is that you probably dont need to clean the wound with peroxide or use epsom salts In most cases we recommend gently cleansing the incision with plain soap and water then patting dry But again this depends on the type of closure you had on the incision Using an antibacterial bandage as youve done isnt a bad idea A key question in terms of whether or not you should have this checked out is this Are you running a fever A fever is the classic sign of infection If youre not running a fever as checked by a thermometer then youre probably OK to wait for your next checkup If your next checkup is weeks away you could put a call in to your surgeons office and ask to speak to the nurse She or he can give you further instructions on how to care for your incision A 18inch opening or red spot isnt usually concerning and what youre perceiving as yellow pus might not be infection at all Its not uncommon for any wound to ooze a sticky yellowish substance that is basically excess protein cells produced by the body for healing I hope this info helps If you have any concerns please dont hesitate to phone your surgeons office Im voting for doctorworthy What your describing could possibly be the formation of a  which is basically a large bruise However unlike superficial bruises hematomas are sizeable collections of blood that can become infected if not treated Thats why Id recommend you get this checked out by a doctor At best it will turn out to be nothing and youll have peace of mind It seems like a cantlose scenario to me Good luck to you To be honest Id have this checked out Chronic can be caused by an injury like the one you describe Its even possible you suffered a small fracture At any rate the sooner you have it checked out the more effective treatment might be at heading off ongoing problems You dont need to rush to the emergency room but you might call your primary care provider for an evaluation He or she might want to take an Xray just to be sure theres no break Your provider also can give you more specific information about the prognosis Good luck to you If you feel you may be hypothyroid it wouldnt be a bad idea to get checked out If you do have  you should be treated for it Breast tenderness generally isnt considered a symptom of hypothyroidism but it can be a symptom of other hormonal changes or imbalances Some women complain of breast tenderness during perimenopause or  and they also discover they are hypothyroid at that time So it can appear as if the hypothyroidism and tender breasts are linked when they arent necessarily in a clinical sense Your best bet is to make an appointment for an evaluation by a health care provider particularly since you said you have a lump on or near your thyroid gland Hypothyroidism can be treated and the sooner you catch it the better Best to you Im sorry youre going through this and hope you have sought medical treatment Unfortunately its impossible to diagnose a condition like this without a physical exam Many conditions can cause the symptoms you describe A medical professional needs to see this and possibly run some additional tests in order to figure out whats going on Meanwhile be extremely careful not to touch surfaces or other people while the rash on your hands is active Wear light gloves if possible to keep from spreading whatever this may be to others I hope you get a diagnosis and feel better soon Id suggest you get this looked at Chances are its a common wart or something benign but theres always a possibility its a skin cancer Obviously youd want to treat that right away No need to rush to the emergency room Id suggest you make an appointment with a dermatologist or your primary care provider Meanwhile try not to scratch it squeeze it or pick at it Any of that type of behavior can break open the skin and make it easy for bacteria to enter You dont want to get a skin infection on top of this Feel free to wash or shampoo as normal This should not cause any ill effects to the bump Be a bit careful combing or brushing your hair so you dont catch the bump on the implement and tear it off or something Hope this helps I certainly understand her reluctance to seek medical attention when she doesnt have insurance Many communities offer free or lowcost clinics to people who are uninsured Maybe you can help her find one of these I think your daughter needs to get this checked out It may be completely benign such as a lipoma a fatty noncancerous tumor But then again it could be something more serious Certainly if your daughter has a fever or is experiencing unintended weight loss she needs to be checked out as soon as possible You might encourage your daughter also by reminding her the cost of an office visit is substantially less than the cost of an emergency room visit so why put off getting this thing looked at I wish your daughter all the best You could take a home pregnancy test to find out or have your doctor take a blood sample Both can detect a certain hormone in a woman when she is pregnant then you dont have to wonder any more I would first check the side effects of the medications you are taking and see if that is listed I checked my new medications today and that was one of the side effects Good luck To soon to tell Wait a week before your period is due and take a test From my understanding this is not abnormal Women experience these types of symptoms after menstration in many cases It depends on how long it is after but it sounds like its right after you stop bleeding This is common but should be discussed with your OB or primary to make sure they understand Your body may go through a few different changes like this over the few months right after you stop a birth control regimine Your bodys hormones have been confused and challenged by the medicaton and it takes time for your natural cycles and funtions to return Could be som thyroid problems especially if your throat is sore or you feel like youre choking Should bring to your physicians attention Should get checked out further could be an array of symptoms Gout almost always starts with pain in one of your big toes Gout is a build up of too much uric acid in the body and the pain is first felt in one of the big toes or both The symptoms you are describing sound more like a condition called neuropothy a painful condition caused by over active nerve endings Ask your doctor if it could be that it doesnt sound at all like gout to me I know I got it tired once and cut but like you said it could have untied I took a test 3 days into me being late which came back negative but i have like I did with my first 3 so I have no clue Ive done my research on the tubal ligation and damn people still get pregnant after getting them tied So i dont know In a 28 day cycle ovulation likely takes place around day 14 Pregnancy can result from intercourse 4 days before to 3 days after ovulation which would be days 10 to 17 So yes that activity on day 12 could lead to pregnancy but Id be surprised at the symptoms showing so quickly Possibly a mouth ulcer It sounds similar to what my mom has a fungus growing inunder the nail Hers however was not tender or painful She wont go to the doctor for it because she doesnt wear open toed shoes and just doesnt want to tell the doctor Hey look at my black toe because she thinks it would sound insane As far as I know the doctor can give you a prescription for a fungicidal pill that will clear it right up This happened to my sister before and her period and it got pretty serious she got a infection because the doctor said that their was a build up of dried blood that stayed inside her due to leaving her tampon inside her for a long time I would recomened using a pad if this happens or getting yourself cleaned It may be due to TMJ I had a swollen lymph node in my neck left side for months and then it disappeared The diagnosis was TMJ Have you been tested for fibromyalgia I have this and the pain moves to different areas Yes if you are female and have had sexual intercourse Very much so You can be pregnant and still have your period I did for the first 4 months Id no idea I was pregnant until I went to my doctors for feeling run down and bloated and Im a doctor When my doctor told me I was pregnant I was so surprised I said like a dope wow I wonder how that happened He gave me a look which made me feel about 2 high I thought I had the flu and here he tells me I have the 9 month flu Should have seen my husbands face as we had needed fertility medication to get our first child and now God just blessed us with one and we were through the first trimester without all that worry too so some things can be a blessing in the long run Im sure youve read about women who actually deliver and never knew they were pregnant or at least thats what they say Ive had 4 sons and Ive no idea how you could not know you are pregnant once the little one starts tap dancing on your insides Mine wouldnt even let me read in bed I would prop the book on my stomach as I really had nowhere else to prop it and holding it in mid air that high would have made my arms ache but as soon as the baby felt the book on my abdomen he would kick at it bounce his feet off it and try to get it off of my stomach by any way possible It really was funny but after a while a little annoying too Be Well Aylagh MacAnnadh MD Possibly stress related I would take NO chances I would go to your family doctor and ask them to see possibly a cardiologist Better to be safe than sorry Good luck For some people a urine test stick does not always work The HCG Hormone or pregnancy hormone may not be prevelant enough for the pee test to work I had a friend who had this problem She tried a pee test after she was knowingly several months pregnant and still came back with several false pee test You will have to go to your doctor and have a blood test done to confirm wether or not you are pregnant For whatever reason you may be one that a home pregnancy test might not work Your other symptoms could be pregnancy related but if not your doctor should be able to help you figure out what may be causing your symptoms Good luck Hi Well its either a skipped period or your pregnant if its the later then you will need to wait till what would be the date of your next period and do a pregnancy test then If not see your doctor for a test Good Luck Hi In that case I would get off to your doctor ASAP Good Luck Hi Sorry for not getting back to but this never got to me just found it for me I would say go get tested either and HPT or at you doctors Look you have not said but are you or at the time you had

if you miss then do a test Hope this helps Good Luck Hi TOG found you this info the post for it sounded just like your problem There are two possible explanations for excessive blood in the uterus 1 HematometraThis is a collection of blood or unexpelled menstrual blood trapped inside the uterus I have seen this condition where the cervical canal has scarred over eg from a laser or LEEP procedure such that the blood can not pass out into the vagina I have also seen it after an abortion where the cervix is temporarily swollen shut so blood is retained Lastly some congenital abnormal structures of the uterus can prevent flow from escaping This later cause is usually found only in young teen women Retained blood in the uterus can prompt abdominal pain and an enlarged tender uterus 2 A toothick excessive uterine liningIn this scenario it is not blood rather an excessively thick lining inside the uterus This is way more common than a hematometra The usual cause of a too thick lining is missed ovulations The concern with a thickened lining is the development of abnormal precancerous cells This would not cause abdominal pain You mentioned having had removal of your right ovary last month It is unlikely for blood related to your surgery to be trapped inside the uterus It would be possible that you could have missed several ovulations due to the stress of the surgery and any right ovary problems The consultation with the GYN should give you the most for sure answer They can clarify what exactly was seen on ultrasoundblood in the uterus or an excessively thick lining Bottom line both are readily treatable Yours Jane Thats Jane Harrison Hoher RNRNP here on WebMD Do hope this helps you Good Luck Hi See Above Answer sorry it wont come up without a prompt glitch on WebMD Hi You should see your doctor and get a blood test done this will tell you doctor were you are with your hormones heshe can take it from there as you have not said it could also be the menopause kicking in

its way through dry cotton She could be just having a skipped period but if she is really worried the either do an HPT or get e test done at her doctors the second would be the best way out for her tell her not to worry what happens at her doctor is between her and the doctor If shes thinking pregnant then any little twinges she will think pregnant its all in the mind it can happen just like phantom pregnancys happen Do hope this helps Good Luck PS If shes OK the her its time to get on some kind of BC the pill cap or IUD but not depo shot just to many side effects Hi Sounds like its your hormones getting out of whack at that time of the month your only way to find out would be by having some tests done at a normal time of the month and why its happening Blood tests that is for hormones Hope this helps Good Luck Hi See Above Answer sorry it wont come up without a prompt glitch on WebMD Hi Try this If you got your period today youre not pregnant Sore nipples arise when oestrogen becomes dominant in your system Your body released more oestrogen because you were going to have your period in two weeks In order to have a period your body release another hormone Progesterone which simultaneously starts the flow and stops any fertilization of remaining egg follicles You could have sore nipples all through your period this time oestrogen can make you nauseated You are not pregnant You just need to learn more about the process your body goes through preparing for Menstruation Something may have stimulated the excess oestrogen in your system It could be just your body changing or even food containing animal oestrogen Hope this helps your problem in some way Good Luck Hi Have a read through this link its from the NHS in the UK English girls get the same

but no rice beads If you worry about those  funny bumps  on the areola those are supposed to be there they are called Montgomery glands or areolar skin glands Their function is partially unknown but scientists suppose they secrete a liquid that lubricates the nippleareola area These Montgomery glands can be about unnoticeable OR stand out as bumps on the areola They often become more prominent during pregnancy Also it appears they are white in some women Some women have squeezed them and can get a white substance out but please do NOT squeeze them because that causes them to become infected In one study it was noted that women with more areolar glands had better or more optimal breastfeeding start after delivery They also noted that the glands were seen in virtually all women in the study but with great interindividual variations their areolar distribution was nonrandom and about 15 of the women had glands giving off a secretion this is about women who have just given birth So hope this bit helps Ile try doing some more research for you Good Luck Our feet change as we age and the way you position your feet in your shoes change too My arches in my feet are gone so I have to wear inserts You may just need new shoes as your big toes are taking a beating from the shoes being too small or perhaps you need a wide shoe versus one that is narrow Just my thoughts on that Doesnt mean that you are not pregnant You might be having a fallopian tube pregnancy which is very serious Go see a ObGyn doctor right away for test to confirm Those home pregnancy tests dont always tell the truth that may be the case if you are taking any kind of estrogen supplement or possibly oral contraceptives thats my best guess im not too keen on many issues of the female anatomy i apologize if you have a sinus infection youre gonna need antibiotics unless its a fungal sinus infection then you will need an anti fungal medication but it could also be sinusitis in that case its inflammation from allergies or a viral infection you should go see a doctor about it if he thinks you have a sinus infection hes gonna give you the antibiotics or anti fungal prescription but if its just sinusitis he will probably give you an antihistamine or possibly antiviral medication depending on what kind of sinusitis it is the worst case scenario is probably fungal I am not a doctor i just picked up a little bit of information about this so do not hang on what i tell you see a professional could be your ovaries you should go get an xray or whatever your doctor orders just to be safe The only way to know for sure is to take a pregnancy test Good luck Please dont post pictures Besides it would not be possible to definitively make a diagnosis based solely on your story did you have poison ivy contact and a photo of the rash The fact that your eyes are puffy and itchy does point to some sort of contact dermatitis The skin only responds in a few ways the most common being a rash and

prescription corticosteroids I know you are not itching pun intended to see your medical provider but this is the only way to get an accurate diagnosis and a definitive treatment regime Bellybuttons like other areas of your skin surface are very subject to skin infections Tenderness and redness are signs of infection so you will need to clean this area carefully with an antibacterial solultion use a topical antibacterial ointment and cream and see if it improves In it does not you will need to see your medical provider for a proper examination and treatment If I cant SEE itfeel this lesion firsthandI cant identify it This is why you need to have a proper medical evaluation You most definitely should get another urine test culture If the lab tests are negative you may not need another course of antibiotics but other causes for your symptom array should be medicallyexplored by your doctor Before considering alternative therapies whatever you were planning it is best to be properly diagnosed You need to have your arm by a medical providerand have an xray Symptoms alone are not sufficient to determine if you have a fracture or not I dont knowyou didnt post the LOCATION of this gland or lymph node For genital herpes this is usually in the groin area Very normal This is most likely ADOLESCENT GYNECOMASTIA you can find lots of information on this temporary condition from WebMD or a Google search Tender nipples or getting breast development can be frightening during puberty While this condition is temporary it can last for a few years involve both breasts and will keep his shirt on for a while Let him read what you find on the Internet and assure him that he is not alone I see this every week in our Adolescent clinic This is just raging hormones Males have both male and female hormones and this is just a response from the female hormone His male hormones testosterone will still be prevalent Gynecomastia can create very tender breasts so just bumping in to them or having his peers or sibling tease him can be emotionally painful Be nice Dont tease or let anyone else do it either If he wants to wear a shirt in the swimming pool let him If you look around there are many other teens wearing shirts too This is not just to protect their back from sun They may have some breast development as well I dont knowI cant SEE it or EXAMINE you to be able to offer you a definite answer It could be a sebaceous cyst a localized skin infection or even a reactive preauricular lymph node You will need to physically see a medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated Since this lump is painful and tender I would suggest that you do this as soon as possible Not enough informationI have no idea what KIND of cyst where it is located etc Redness and tenderness are signs that this cyst wherever it is could be infected and require medical intervention No the penicillin did not cause his gums to bleed This was just a coincidence but bleeding gums are a sign of gingivitis so it may be wise to consult his dentist See your medical provider This may be GOUT You cannot carry a tubal pregnancy to term and while there have been cases where a blotched tubal ligation resulted in a subsequent pregnancy there are very very rare After a tubal ligation you are most likely permanently sterile Your tender breasts are likely to be cause by other reasons so please see your medical provider or gynecologist for a proper examination As you knowI cant see or examine you and your description is vague Look up ganglion cyst on the Internet  this is one possibility of many I really dont now since I have no way of seeing this lesion and examining you A vague description really isnt sufficient to make this important diagnostic call so I suggest that you see your medical provider or even dentist to have this bubble properly identified Unless a dentist removed your wisdom teeth you can still have them but there can be other reasons to account for your symptomssuch as an abscess or infection or a reactive lymph node Please see your medical provider or dentist so that you can be properly examined and diagnosed It would not be very likely that you would conceive in this way but to be safe just do a few home pregnancy tests and consider this a lessonlearned This practice is very dangerous sexplay that will eventually lead to intercourse so be prepared Dont be in denial that it will not eventually happen Clearly you are in an intimate relationship so go to Student Health and get on an effective contraceptive pill Depo etc and make that boyfriend of yours use a condomeven if you both have clothes on It is always safer to contain those babycausing sperm on one place If he cant keep them in his testicles then he should at least keep them in a condom Those symptoms justify a medical visit They could signal a hormonal problem that may need further investigation As much as I would like to address your concerns I really do not know anything about youyour age medical history or even if you are a female men have breasts too More importantly it would take a thorough examination to determine if this lump is worrisome or not Although I am sympathetic to your lack of insurance an examination is really the only way to make this important call I can tell you that lumps that come and go are more likely to be cysts especially if the lumps are influenced by your menstrual cycle again assuming you are female Breast cancers do not come and gosadly they tend to stay and get bigger over time No medical professional could make an accurate assessmentdiagnosis based solely on a vague description Your son needs to have this lump carefully examined by a medical professional It could be many different thingsa sebaceous cyst a reactive postoccipital lymph nodeor  Please encourage him to do the right thing and have it properly examined and diagnosed You need to get a tetnus shotbooster possibly infection have a doctor look

effectivebest to take a test just for good measure I have not missed my period yet So I am playing the waiting game now I guess It will fall out in a day or two and the pain will go down If it is really bothering you you can suck on ice or an ice pop and that should help numb it a bit The only thing you can do is wait And DO NOT PULL IT OUT Seriously Ive done that it doesnt help save yourself the extra day of misery and just let it fall out on its own Source I get those all the time Are you a diabetic if so you need to be seen by your medical provider immediately as this is a sign there is no blood flow to the area which is common with diabetics I am a diabetic and was told to examine my feet regularly even if you are not a diabetic I would get your toe checked out and ask about a diabetes screening too Hope this answer helps you I had that happen several years ago my Doctor diagnosed it as a hernia they do a wait and see with it if it doesnt go away it is repairable with surgery so a visit to your medical provider is suggested hope my answer helps you iim sorry to say you have flatworms most of tpain comes from the rightt side if you know your body real good Biltricide will clean up the tapeworm problem i know my whole family went threw this Take a hpt and then follow up with your Gyn It could be a variety of things the test may have been false positive To be on the safe side i would urge you to see a doctor and explain all symtoms to them Above all remain calm and dont stress yourself out it will all be ok It stays in the whole time I go see my doctor in the am to find out exactly whats wrong with me I have read that it could be a number of things and not be pregnancy related Ill post back Yes You should still be tested just to be sure A pregnancy should be detected asap I would buy one of those pregnancy tests and try it I hope you arent pregnant but you need to find out what is going on Do a pregnancy test and then go to a doctor Best wishes for a speedy recovery yes did you find out what the problem was I am dealing with the same pain The test would be conclusive at that time However the HIV virus can take some time before being able to show up on a test Getting tested again wouldnt hurt Once every 6 months to a year is ideal especially if you are continuing to have sex with sex workers I wouldnt freak out too much yet though Many things can cause swollen lymph nodes including a sinus infection it doesnt sound too serious it sounds like an ear infectionmy glands swell when i get ear infections it may not have happened to u before but u need to remember that it is all connected stinging pain in my right big toe onlythat comes and goesWhat is this yes u could go see a doctor to be for sure I went to school for dental assisting and what it sounds like is a blood blister I dont know all your symptoms but thats usually what they look like They can occur anywhere in the mouth and will eventually go away No Im not quite sure what the scabs are But I can say if you go to another foam party make sure you are well covered up The foam gets on everyone and goes everywhere Then spreads So not trying to gross you out but its the truth imagine that someone is wearing a dress with a thong and has a yeast infection That infection is now going to travel throughout the rest of the dance floor and whatever it touches it will infect So if it touches your eye you will have a yeast infection in your eye So you might have caught something while you were at the foam party But I do recommend that the next time you go to a foam party take extreme precautions and clean yourself very well the next day and make sure you are covered up Hope this helps thank you for answering thisi had the same thing happen with my first pregnancyi spottedbleed thru the first 6 months and went to the doctor for what I thought was a cold tooi had no symtoms of being pregnant so when the told me I was 6 months along I almost passed outhe became very active after I found outI was hoping this was happening again and nothing was wrongglad to know im not the only one who went thru it i do not know the answer i am trying to figure it out myself You could have an ectopic pregnancy which can be life threatening It takes on the symptoms of early pregnancy You need to go to an obgyn and have them check for it Its not fun but it can save your lifeor just give you definite answers There are free clinics like planned parenthood that have well trained doctors if you dont have insurance You could have ectopical pregnancy which means youre pregnant outside the uterus maybe the tubes Go see your obgyn so they will take a blood test to see whats going on I too have several bulging discs in my spine I was injured when I was a teenager the injury progressed into sciatica and degenerative arthritis and now I require a cane um it was pretty close to a normal one maybe a day or so shorter but since then now i havent had my period since then so idk if its because i have had my period twice in one month or what but i plan on getting a test if i dont get my period within another week Yesget tested for pregnancy at least to rule it out When I conceived my children I felt as though I would start my period but never did so yes I was cramping which I believe is just the Zygote attaching to your uterine wall and is common I believe At least it was for me Sounds to me like you were ovulating on day 11 and 12 and if you had unprotected intercourse and now feeling the symptoms of pregnancy Id go get tested Sounds to me like you just encountered the same situation I did when I conceived my first child I know the exact date of her conception because of this Either you banged it and it is bruised or there can also be a fungus under the nail Best thing to do is consult your PCP to be sure Some fungus medicines effect your liver therefore it would be wise to consult a physician before you use fungicidal medicine  I have never heard of the medicine you are on but everytime I mention or show my doctor a lump in my neck or something he says its a lymph node that possibly I may getting a cold or something He says that is a sign your bodys trying to fight an infection Hope this helps some yes I have the same problem but i have had back surgery with fusion and cage in backu Have not been able to find the causeThought maybe a kidney stone but pain comes and goes "}
