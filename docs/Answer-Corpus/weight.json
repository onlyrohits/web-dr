can of Pepsi contains 150 calories Drinking 8 cans per day adds an additional 1200 calories If you could eliminate 7 of cans per day you would save 1000 daily calories from being added to your diet

back on the soda to one per day Thats not too bad Weaning yourself off the soda slowly perhaps by eliminating 1 can every 3 days may help with possible withdrawal headaches Those last 10 pounds always

wishes for your success Its a great question especially since so many individuals are prescribed Prozac and other similar drugs Ive been interested in the subject since I was prescribed Prozac for many years and have some of the symptoms associated with Cushings syndromeI read in the past for example that a single 30 mg dose of Prozac increases cortisol levels two fold Yet much is unknown by the psychopharmacologic experts about Prozac and its potential for causing Cushings syndrome Most studies have involved only rats and mice subjected to Prozac assault in large doses over a period of weeks In actually Prozac taken by humans is usually prescribed in doses totaling 20 mg 80 mg daily for many months or years I believe that much more research is needed to be completed on this topic before an absolute cause and effect relationship can be established in humans At this point in time because of the limited scientific studies most answers can only consist of anecdotal accountings such as mine  Losing weight is best accomplished by starting a program of modest exercise and by reducing daily caloric intakeLow carb diets are potentially dangerous and do not keep the weight off over the long haul In assessing nutritional needs I recommend dividing the daily calories consumed as follows 55 carbs  15 protein  and 30 fats  Start out by determining a goal weight The goal weight should be discussed with your wifes physician and is based upon her age gender and height Now find an internet calculator that will tell you how many daily calories must be consumed to maintain that weight gain some weight or lose some weight I suggest a safe weight loss of 12 pounds per week For example the calculator may say that your wife can consume 1600 daily calories and lose 15 pounds per week That would be a very nice 6 pound monthly weight loss It would also mean that her daily carbs should be around 880 1600 xs 55  880 There are many tasty and filling 1300 1400 1600 1800 and 2000 calorie diets available free on line Some of them include monthly menus shopping lists recipes and snacks Im glad that you have a beautiful wife and just know that you will help her during a successful weight loss journey Losing weight requires a plan of action customized for the individual one size wont fit all people I would recommend that you first setup a visit with your family doctor That individual can complete blood studies do a routine EKG urine labs and overall asses your general health It is important to rule out medical conditions such as thyroid disease which might be contributing to weight gain Your doctor can recommend diets clear you for an exercise program and possibly refer you to a physician specializing in weight management After receiving your doctors approval I suggest that you search the internet for weight calculators and diet plans based upon your sex height weight and age Once your have ascertained an ideal weight these calculators will suggest an ideal daily caloric intake based upon the total weight that you wish to lose within a given period You will find weekly and monthly menu plans for daily caloric intake ranging from 1300  1800 It will take some work on your part but some of these sites provide varied meal plans that include snacks desserts and even provide main course recipes and a weekly shopping list Meals for losing

harder to find answers before posting questions again Hope someone finds this helpful Cheers YES You should probably do your own homework  Its estimated that 3500 calories is the theoretical amount necessary to lose 1 pound of fat To put this in perspective you will need to create a deficit of 500 calories per day to lose 1 pound per week again theoretically This deficit can come from either eating less expending calories through exercise or a combination of both A healthy weight loss rate is 1 to 2 pounds per week or 10 of your body weight over the course of 6 months A common mistake that people make is to not continually recalculate their calorie needs Keep in mind that as you lose weight you will need to readjust your calorie intake accordingly Do not go below 1200 calories per day however without medical supervision If you hit a plateau and arent seeing weight loss adjust your calorie intake or be more stringent with eating healthier Changes in the gym that can help break through a plateau include  increasing the amount of time you spend per exercise session  increasing the number of days per week you exercise  increasing the intensity level of the exercise  changing the type of exercise altogether Its always best to consult with your doctor or a registered dietitian when making changes to your diet or beginning an exercise routine There are lots of websites and phone apps available to help you calculate your calorie needs and to use for foodexercise journaling though I recommend the Food and Fitness Planner on WebMD available here httpwwwwebmdcomdietfoodfitnessplannerdefaulthtm  When you first begin a strength training routine its always best that you start out with a much lower weight than you think necessary and progress until you reach an appropriate level Most people aim for 812 or 1215 repetitions per set but dont just stop your set because you reached some arbitrary number Its important to keep working your muscles until you reach muscular fatigue If you find that you are doing an excessive amount of repetitions per set then it may be beneficial to increase the weight further to bring that number down to a more manageable number If youre doing too few repetitions consider decreasing the weight to bring the number up a bit since it may be too heavy of a weight for you Remember to always reevaluate what youre doing while strength training You want to be continually challenging yourself and progressing Try occasionally increasing the weight by small increments adding more repetitions to your set or adding more sets to your workout If it might help some people will write down and keep a log of the weight number of sets and number of repetitions for each exercise that they do if you cant recall off the top of your head Proper form helps to ensure two things that youre working the intended muscle and that youre helping to minimize your risk of injury Basic strength training is designed to isolate a target muscle or muscle group through a set range of motion or action meant to improve muscular strength and endurance or to improve athletic performance In other words not following proper form may leave you with less than desired results since you may not be working the specific muscle as intended As for proper form helping to prevent injury there really isnt much research to prove that claim necessarily Common sense however would suggest that performing high risk behaviors may increase your chances for injury Twisting jerking excessively forceful or high impact motions or movements may increase the risk for injury in an unconditioned person as will perhaps using muscles other than were intended for certain exercises Proper form alone or as part of series of actions can help to control your movement and technique to prevent injury Strength training along with cardiovascular exercise can boost your metabolism and can help you expend calories to lose weight Strength training however also has the added benefit of helping you to preserve muscle as well If you lose weight while only doing cardiovascular exercise some of the weight loss may come from body fat as well as muscle You want to preserve muscle because it can help to keep your metabolism elevated since muscle burns calories at a higher rate than fat Strength training can also help to promote a more toned appearance which would be another added benefit to you as well The Surgeon General recommends that you strength train all major muscle groups two or more days per week Consult your doctor before starting an exercise routine The metabolism calculator likely is using the HarrisBenedict equation which is a method to estimate your basal metabolic rate BMR and daily calorie requirements The variables that this equation takes into consideration are age height weight gender and activity level Keep in mind that this is an indirect method of calorie assessment and is only an estimate There are other equations but this is typically the equation that most registered dietitians use How much weight you should increase by can depend on the particular exercise or the muscles involved Nonetheless the best course of action would be to Increase the weight slowly and gradually This may involve some trial and error but keep in mind that in some cases you can increase by 25  5 pound increments Besides increasing weight consider adding more repetitions to your set at the current weight youre at Try alternating between using machines and free weights for the same exercise as well or just try working the same muscle in a different fashion to promote further results Be sure to have someone supervise or spot you while you lift It can be frustrating when youre putting so much hard work into losing weight only to hit a plateau Dont be discouraged a few simple changes may be all that you need For exercise consider the FITT principle F  Frequency  How often or how many days you exercise I  Intensity  How hard you work during your exercise T  Time  How long or how many minutes you spend per session T  Type  The type of activity that you are doing Making adjustments in one of these areas could help you break through your plateau Of course the more that you do with your exercise the greater the benefits you should see from it For example lets say that your current exercise routine is walking three times per week for thirty minutes at a moderate intensity You could add more days per week or spend more time per session to expend more calories and hopefully further boost your metabolism to promote weight loss Try increasing the intensity by walking at a quicker pace or incorporating intermittent bouts of jogging You could also try carrying arm weights having a weighted backpack or incorporating more hills or inclines to challenge yourself further Your body may have just become accustomed to your exercise routine so sometimes it can also be helpful to change the type of activity as well Try different forms of cardiovascular exercise or try doing strengthbuilding exercise if youre not already With nutrition try reassessing your dietary intake In what ways can you eat healthier Can you eat out less often or drink less soda What about having less chips pastries or candy Can you increase your fruit or vegetable intake Try food journaling to track and monitor your dietary intake so that you can better recognize areas for improvement Dont forget to reevaluate your calorie needs as you continue to lose weight Keep working at it Often times the best way to break through a plateau is simply persistence many people want to \t\t\t lose weight there are many diet plans available to do thisbut before you consider whether to use a diet plan find out

shown a very strong correlation between a lack of physical activity and the development of anxiety disorders This relationship isnt entirely clear but many of the proposed causes of this include Unused Energy  One of the most frequently cited reasons for anxiety is unused energy Your body was made to move and unfortunately when it doesnt move it creates tension We see this actually with dogs often  dogs that dont get their daily walks often become anxious and high strung because if they dont work out their energy that energy turns first into physical tension and then into mental tension Increased Stress Hormone  When you feel stress your body releases a hormone known as cortisol Theres evidence that movement is what depletes cortisol bringing it back to normal levels This makes sense because anxiety itself is the fight or flight system When your body experiences it it expects you to fight or flight Inactivity is essentially doing nothing and that may cause your body to start misfiring your stress and anxiety hormones Immune System Malfunction  Exercise is also necessary for a regulated immune system as well as maintaining a healthy hormone balance Theres reason to believe that inactivity prevents these important things from occurring There may also be secondary components as well Those that are often inactive are also often enjoying less experiences and positive experiences are good for anxiety Those that arent working to improve their health may develop small problems that create anxiety on their own These may all be contributing factors So please go ahead with your plan for exercising Good luck on everything Dhammika Abeygoonawardhane Sri Lanka If you can rewrite including your BMI it will really help for a answer As much as youll probably hate to hear this you really need to see a doctor Are you eating wellenough The symptoms you listed could be any number of things simple or serious You really need to see someone that can go through all the possibilities and can do some tests There are some known serious drug interactions between Prozac and certain types of weight loss pills Phentermine for example when combined with Prozac can lead to serotonin syndrome A severe case of serotonin syndrome left untreated can be fatal The short answer is this Not until youre released to do so by your surgeon Every person heals differently Some people bleed more easily than others for example Only your surgeon can tell you when its OK to return to normal activities As a plastic surgery nurse I worked with many people who wanted to get back to physical activity quickly after surgery and I always told them the same thing A little patience now means you wont have complications later You dont want to rush into activities like weightlifting that could ruin your surgery and require you to have another procedure Heres some general information from WebMD about that you might find helpful Best wishes to you Im sure youll be back to running and lifting in no time Great question Im glad you asked A nutritional supplement is not likely to help with premature ejaculation and theres no scientific evidence any of these male enhancement products actually help with male sexual performance What concerns me is the number of these all natural herbal supplements that have been found at least in the US to contain actual prescription medications designed to treat  The US Food and Drug Administration FDA has issued several alerts and recalls over the past few years on this type of product though not Vigormax specifically that I know of The addition of these prescription drugs to overthecounter dietary supplements is illegal and dangerous Manufacturers do not disclose these drugs on the label So my advice to you is to seek medical treatment for your issue and to give the nutritional supplements a pass Some things you can do to help with premature ejaculation Stop smoking drinking or using illicit drugs Use a condom to reduce sensation in the penis Try different sexual positions to reduce stimulation until ejaculation is desired Sometimes doctors will prescribe antidepressant medications to treat premature ejaculation Hope this helps Congratulations on losing 40 pounds That is amazing and you should be proud of yourself What youre perceiving as fat around your midsection may in fact be excess skin Sometimes when a person loses a large amount of weight the skin that had stretched out is not able to firm back up when the weight is lost If this is the case theres no exercise you can do to help that flab You can confirm whether or not you have excessive belly skin by consulting your health care provider He or she can tell you if you have more body fat to lose or if you have a skin problem If its a skin problem your only recourse is surgery to remove the excess skin This surgery is called   or tummy tuck Regardless pat yourself on the back for that great weight loss Aw poor baby And poor mom having to go through this I would not recommend selftreating this I would do as the doctor said and wait to see how your son is doing in 5 days Your doctor has very good reasons for recommending your sons foot not be casted immobilized for a period of time Its possible that immobilizing the limb by using something like a walking boot could cause muscle atrophy shrinkage which would be damaging to your son If you have any questions about why your doctor recommended taking a waitandsee approach then Id suggest you call and ask him In the moment of crisis when youre in the ER and feeling anxious about your babys health its easy to forget to ask questions Your doctor wont mind if you call and find out exactly why hes taking this approach with your son Best wishes to you and the little one Its doubtful you could damage a stainless steel plate from a blow that didnt even produce any bruising or swelling That doesnt mean you didnt aggravate the surrounding tissue or injure a different structure such as a tendon or ligament The only way to really tell whats going on is to see a health care provider for a physical examination Given your description however you might also choose to take a watchandwait attitude You can try resting the arm or avoiding those motions that cause pain to see if the pain clears up Sometimes a little rest is all it takes If the symptoms dont clear up or if they get worse  or if by some chance you develop a fever  then Id suggest you definitely seek medical attention Any time symptoms go from better to worse instead of viceversa its worth a trip to the doctor Hope this helps Im sorry to hear of your health woes can be nasty things to deal with I certainly hope youre under the care of a medical professional Both the lump below the jaw and the weight loss would concern me and Id suggest you visit your primary health care provider to find out whats going on A number of conditions can cause those symptoms so you need a diagnosis and possibly treatment Wishing you all the best Im sorry to hear youre going through this It just goes to show how negatively pain can impact so many aspects of our lives I commend you for being committed to your sexual health and marital relationship Youre a good wife for wanting to build that intimacy back up Id suggest you start by assessing what nonsexual positions are the most comfortable for you For example if sitting in a chair provides relief try adapting that for a sexual purpose Have your husband sit on a chair and then sit on your husband if that makes sense Another suggestion is to try having sex in a water environment such as the shower or a bathtub This may be especially helpful if warm water gives you pain relief Just be careful nobody slips You may simply have to experiment to find positions that work for you Do not be shy about seeking out aids such as swings or slings that suspend from the ceiling if you need something like that to help take pressure off your back during sex A less expensive and less permanent solution may involve plenty of pillows to prop and support body parts Again experimentation is going to be key here If you feel shy about expressing your feelings or needs to your partner please dont hesitate to consult your doctor a nurse or a psychotherapist whos experienced in sexual health to help with communication and to help you find solutions Believe me they will understand your concerns and treat you with utmost respect All the best to you Well first let me say no one should take more than the recommended dose of any medication or supplement Theres usually a good reason why those limits were set Just because supplements are often labeled as natural or healthy doesnt mean you cant experience serious side effects by taking too much of any given product That said I doubt taking a lot of would cause weight loss Probiotics replenish the good flora of the intestinal tract which probably has no effect on the uptake of nutrients but theoretically can prevent diarrhea caused by taking antibiotics possibly help prevent urinary tract infections and have a beneficial effect on colon inflammation If your wife is experiencing unintended weight loss you are right to be concerned Only an examination by a medical professional can help her figure out what is causing the weight loss Id suggest she make an appointment with her primary health care provider to discuss the issue Best of luck to you both Im sorry to hear this Its worrisome for both mother daughter isnt it Your daughter needs to seek medical attention for this Im not talking about rushing to the emergency room but she should make an appointment with a health care provider for an evaluation Its always a concern when someone is losing weight without trying to Many conditions can cause unintentional weight loss including  Only a physical exam and additional testing by a medical professional can diagnose whats causing your daughters symptoms I wish you both the best Oh ouch So much for that whole working out is healthy thing right ha ha Well I think you need to get this checked out Id suggest making an appointment with your primary care provider You may merely have strained a muscle but then again you could have torn one And that would require medical attention Luckily the abdomen is protected with layer upon layer of muscle so its not too likely you suffered say a bowel herniation or something Nonetheless if you start running a fever or vomiting or develop any other unusual symptoms you might consider heading for an urgent care Otherwise youre probably fine to just check in with your primary care provider And of course dont do any weightlifting of any kind until youre cleared by your doc to do so Even leg work can strain your abs and you really need to rest them for now Best wishes Im sorry to hear about your injury Thats no fun Unfortunately theres no straight answer to your question Lifting weights has to do with fitness level not age I know 55 year old women who can bench press over 100 pounds and I know 30 year old women who can barely lift a 5 pound dumbbell If the ability to lift up to 50 pounds is a requirement of your job I suggest you ask your doctor about physical therapy to help increase your upper body strength without injuring your back Or after youve been cleared by a doctor to return to normal duty you could consider increasing your fitness level by working out on your own Be sure to start slowly and gradually build up your strength and endurance WebMD has a great that can help you get started Just remember always get your doctors permission before starting any exercise program Hope this helps Ouch Well the only way to tell for sure is by Xray That said many health care providers wont bother to unless its Grossly deformed like sticking out at an unnatural angle Cold and tingly Gray or pale looking Those three signs could be symptoms of a reduced blood supply to the toe which can lead to permanent damage If the nail has come off or has been loosened so badly that you think it might come off then you should see a medical professional You dont want that to get infected Most times though the pinky toe heals up just fine If its not grossly deformed you may splint it by putting a bit of padding cotton balls work nicely between the pinky and ring toes and then firmly taping the two together Dont tape them so tightly you cut off the blood supply Keep an eye on the toe for any sores that may develop and call your doctor or go to urgent care if any one symptom pain swelling burning tingling gets worse instead of better after about the third day Keep the foot elevated and apply ice if desired This will help reduce swelling and inflammation Sorry to hear about your toe Fractured toes are always so painful First welcome to Answers Second Id like to invite you to join  where you can connect with other people trying to lose weight Your current plan is unsustainable because youre burning more calories 1400 a day than youre taking in 1000 per day The numbers need to be reversed You need to take in a minimum amount of calories per day simply to survive Most people should not eat fewer than 1200 calories per day and in my opinion thats very low And thats without any exercise at all You can use to get a personalized calorie intake plan for weight loss In general to lose weight safely you should add the number of calories you burn from exercise to your minimum calorie intake to see the total number of calories you should consume Heres an example Burn 500 calories per day  1200 calories minimum intake  Consume 1700 calories total You can fudge that number a little to lose weight faster or slower By the way its very difficult to burn 1400 calories per day unless youre already an elite athlete You might need to revise your expectations in terms of exercise Best wishes to you Remember weight loss is a journey Great question Im glad it sounds like you came out of this with just a bad bruise The warmth probably is simply a part of the bodys natural healing process Whenever the body sustains an injury to the tissue it sends an army of cells to the area to repair the injury This cellular activity can cause the area to feel warm If this is whats going on the warmth should go away within a few days If the warmness persists it might be worth having your leg checked out by a doctor just to make sure you didnt bruise the bone and dont have an infection brewing in there In any case if you start to run a fever then its time to see a doctor Otherwise try to keep the leg propped up and maybe put a little ice on the area Use a towel between the ice pack and your skin Leave the ice on for 20 minutes then off for at least 20 minutes Hope this helps Im sorry youre going through this and hope you feel better soon I strongly advise you see your primary care provider as soon as possible to diagnose what is going on It could simply be that youre young and working a lot and dont have time to eat Or it could be a symptom of a larger condition that needs to be treated Unfortunately its impossible to diagnose something like this from the internet You need a physical exam and possibly some blood work to find out whats going on You deserve to be treated if appropriate and live a full life Age 22 should be the prime of your life I hope this helps Most doctors base their recommendation of weight gain on the weight of the mom before pregnancy Women with a normal BMI body mass index should gain anywhere between 25 and 35 pounds and up to 45 for twins Overweight women may be able to safely gain between 15 and 25 pounds but should not use pregnancy as a time to diet or lose weight Check with your doctor to determine if it is safe for you to gain less or more than the recommended range That is a myth Gaining too much weight will not necessarily cause the baby to be larger Just because you are eating for two doesnt mean you should eat twice as much Gaining beyond 25 to 35 pounds for a single birth just makes it harder to lose after the baby is born Forget about dieting for at least six weeks postpartum and focus on eating a healthy diet Most women are

your baby everything he or she needs for growth and development for the first several months Good nutrition is imperative Your diet affects the quality of the breast milk whereas the quantity is based on how much you nurse Calories count throughout pregnancy until the fourth trimester or three months after giving birth because your body needs good nutrition for the growth of the baby Six weeks after the baby is born you can start curbing a few hundred calories a day Consult the US Department of Agricultures web site mypyramidgov to determine the right number of calories for you and shave up

dont go over 3 miles 3 Eat  Consume a lot of carbs from veggies and fruits 34 of your meal should be carbs to give you energy and pack on necessary fat 14 of your meal should be protein to build muscle Contrary to popular beliefs you need plenty of fat storage in order for the body to be healthy and build muscle Consuming protein volume based on your body weight is not accurate for everyone some bodies will not utilize extra protein You want that carb for energy to push harder and grow biggerstronger Eat pasta rice and potatos with every meal You will bulk up in sizestrength adding 10

getting xrays and proper treatment all because of that old adage If you can move it it isnt broken That is only partially true While its possible for people to experience muscle stimulation from pacemakers its typically the diaphragm as it lies close the the right ventricle which is actually being paced While I cant diagnose the cause of your muscle twitching in this forum I would guess that left pectoralis stimulation would be pretty unlikely particularly if it doesnt seem related to your heart rate Always helpful to get checked out by your doctor if you have any concerns About one in three women leak urine after giving birth This is called stress incontinence and its due to weakened pelvic floor muscles allowing for the neck of the bladder to sag down so that urine can escape with laughing coughing or sneezing Most doctors tell women to do Kegel exercises to strengthen their pelvic floor muscles In some cases surgery is required But studies have also shown that vaginal weights can strengthen the muscles enough to reduce incontinence as well Heres how they work You insert a coneshaped weight into your vagina and then work on squeezing your muscles to keep the weights in place for about 15 minutes once or twice a day You can actually go about your daily business while doing this Once youre able to hold this weight in easily you try a slightly heavier weight They are sold in sets Advocates of the weights believe that its easier for a woman to learn to isolate and train her pelvic floor muscles properly using the weights than it is using just Kegels which are easy to do incorrectly You can get vaginal weights overthecounter online or as a prescription via your health care provider Listen until you no longer hear it at all then record your reading I would go

opinion She is most likely just fine however there is no reason for you to have to worry about it constantly and you just need to tell your MD you expect some answers When referring to the Portion Size Plate found here  the Meats and Proteins group shows portions of cooked meat For example 3 ounces of cooked chicken is equal to the size of a deck of cards That portion is the same for fish turkey and lean beef Beans are cooked portions as well Half a cup of cooked beans is equal to the size of a light bulb A pound of fat and a pound of muscle weigh the same The difference is that a pound of muscle is denser and therefore takes up much less surface area than fat If you were to look at five pounds of muscle and five pounds of fat the fat would take up much more volume It is possible for you to lose fat and gain muscle without a change in body weight because you are building muscle through exercising Sometimes your body fat percentage can be a better indicator than the number on the scale and you can get this tested by a medical professional As you lose weight your caloric intake will decrease Meaning your body will need less calories to function as you lose weight You could not be eating enough calories as well If we do not eat enough calories to function our bodies will move into a starvation mode and we will conserve the calories stored and this will prevent

not bad for you Im 23 with Hypothyroid Until they have you on the rite dose and taking consistant for 6 mnths to a year theres nothing you can do about the weight gain After that you should start feeling better and be able to lose the weight you want Its okay to eat sweets and junk food Theres nothing that says that the body cant handle it You just have to focus on moderation I know people say that all the time and its like yeah yeah please shut up But its true And also if you do have some ice cream or cake have water with it That way the water will make you full so you wont want any more Well my friend if I might help Everyones body is slightly different I recently lost 50 pounds in about 4 months I have done this several times Let me start by saying you gotta eat To tell you what I did and how I lost the weight is the best I can do First you gotta have breakfast The most important meal of the day My breakfast would consist of a Egg white Omelet 38 eggs with ham and turkey in it Sometimes I would add some cheese to itI would also eat some pork bacon or a sausage patty with it and fruit either watermelon or pineapple or strawberries I would drink water with every meal and all throughout the day sometimes using those sugar free packs I would then for lunch eat some nuts almonds or pistachios just a handful or so I would also drink a protein shake because I was doing double cardios230min sessions and still lifting weight from time to time By dinner time I was feeling really starved I ate dinner at 5pm almost every day I would eat a nice portion of meat some veggies and the occasional salad with it For a snack at night some more nuts The important thing to remember is to stick with it once you get started Diet is 90 of it So make sure you eat healthy Stay away from sweets and if you want tea make sure you dont add any sugar to itnot accusing you of doing so Weigh yourself on Sunday and then proceed to give this a shot and check by Saturday If you lost weight fantastic I hope this helps This is a common side effect of this class of medications My recommendation is to always talk to your health care provider first They may be able to lower the dose of your medication so the weight gain may subside They may also refer you to a nutritionist who can help you with diets and eating habits Many patients that I talk to also try taking up simple exercises like walking Simple steps like this can go a long way This is a great question Here are some risk factors for type 2 diabetes from the American Diabetes Association Age over 45 People with family history

Thats wonderful that you are providing 24 hour care for your mom Its also wonderful that you are focusing on your own health as well Finding ways to exercise in your home as well as working on your diet could help you lose the weight you have gained in the last year Losing weight usually takes time and taking small steps in increasing your exercise and eating fewer calories every week could help Also seeing your primary doc to make sure there is not a health reason like a thyroid problem causing your weight gain would be beneficial Being a caregiver can be challenging and many caregivers are at risk of experiencing some caregiver burnout Here is a link that provides insight for caregivers httpwwwwebmdcomhealthyagingcaregivinginsightsavoidburnout xmlnamespace prefix  o ns  urnschemasmicrosoftcomofficeoffice opop Take care There are several conditions that can cause unintentional weight loss in a young person Some of the common possible causes include hyperthyroidism overactive thyroid gland diabetes or a problem with absorption of nutrients and vitamins in your digestive tract Depression and anxiety can sometimes lead to weight loss Some infections can lead to weight loss Certain medications can have a side effect of weight loss Cancer can sometimes cause unintentional weight loss Cancer occurs more commonly in older people and is a less common cause of weight loss in young people It would be best for you to see a doctor who can do a medical evaluation to help determine the reason for your weight loss Exercise is a great way to deal with anxiety issues When I was in college I was diagnosed with anxiety issues and my therapist suggested that I start taking daily walks They helped me not only have time each day to clear my head and calm my anxiety but also helped me discover the joys of walking as a form of exercise Im not sure what your comments about the ribs mean but if you are concerned about it you should see a doctor or go to student health for free I would say an Endocrinologists or a doctor that specializes in Internal Medicine The cause of rapid weight gain can be from any number of causes so it is hard to tell Do you feel like its on the ligament itself or somewhere on the bone I had a similar incident and when it was xrayed it came up as an abnormality BUT they sent for CT scan and found that it was calcium build up When you injure a part of your body blood flows to that area and calcium tends to build up at the site Get to your local ER NOW What you are referring to could be a life or death situation A retained placenta is nothing to play with and if you have delivered at home because you couldnt get to the hospital for whatever reason or you had a home birth with a midwife DO NOT EVEN LISTEN TO THE MIDWIFE GO TO YOUR PHONE NOW AND DIAL 911 I do not mean to be insulting to the midwifery centers or midwives in general but I do not feel the practice is safe and I have seen two cases of a midwife losing both mother and baby when both would probably still be alive if they had been at the hospital When something goes wrong during birth it usually happens hard and fast and if you do not have the equipment you need right there and immediately accessible then you can have a tragedy which was completely unnecessary More and more women are opting for home birth having been told birth is a natural process and yes it is however the risk is just too high and the consequences too severe to risk even one death which doesnt have to happen A retained placenta can cause what in the past was called childbed fever where the mother gets a severe uterine infection There are ways to treat it today however the risks of hysterectomy infertility etc are very real and again unnecessary You can also suffer severe life threatening bleeding from a retained placenta The only safe treatment in my opinion is in a hospital so please go Be well Aylagh MacAnnadh MD It depends Some people gain a little weight while on birth control pills But not everyone does You may notice a bit less water retention which would go away rather quickly  most likely in the first week or two after you stop taking the pill But you are not likely to notice a significant drop in your weight simply by stopping the birth control pill Nitric oxide supplements are not regulated like medications Therefore we have very little reliable information on them I am not aware of any warnings But I have no proof that they actually do anything to make them worth the money My suggestion would be to skip them and save your money Could it be the Sciatica It looks like your exercise routine is sound My only suggestion is make sure your the weights your using in your toning exercises are challenging As you get stronger to continue to improve you will need to go heavier Since youve got a strong exercise program on board now you have to look at your diet I had a professor in grad school who summed it up this way you cant walk run or swim away from your diet All of us struggle loosing that last 10 lbs and to be successful you need to make sure your eating clean One of the best ways to do this is using a food diary I recommend using That way you can determine the calories you need to hit your weight loss goals One thing I really like about utilizing this is if I know Im going out to a friends house for get together or to happy hour with coworkers I can shift my meals around to insure I can go enjoy myself and still stay on track Wow Sounds like your really working hard and eating clean However to fuel weight loss you need to change your program and your going to be surprised by my suggestions First 1250 calories is not enough for a 60 year old The recommended amount of calories for a 60 year old is 1600 calories for women and 2000 calories for men While these are estimates your pretty far away from both Your body is not going to let go of any fat that it has It believes your starving so its holding on to all the calories it can I know its counterintuitive but up the calories to a reasonable level to lose the weight Add veggies at least one more serving of protein and some healthy fats olive oil avocados eggs nuts olives seeds If your doing eight hours of cardiovascular exercise a week a great deal of it is probably long slow distance training You need to change it up Begin interval training Shorter duration but higher intensity Look at the articles pasted below as they map out incorporating interval training into your fitness planOnce again I know its counterintuitive that less time equals more weight loss but the weight loss is spurred on by the higher intensity Reevaluate your strength training workouts by asking yourself am I getting stronger and am I seeing changes With a caloric intake of 1250 calories your probably not So increase the calories and change your routine Visit the link below and incorporate 1 or 2 of the lifts in each section into your routine Remember challenge yourself  Finally it sounds like your really working hard and initially you probably had success but your body has adapted to the program and its time to change it up Since these suggestions are a significant change in your exercise program be sure to check with your physician especially if you have any health conditions Its important to keep in mind that you cant make someone change their habits if they dont want to However you can give them alternatives First what does you son like to do Work from there to find some activities he might be interested in If he enjoys video games what about utilizing Wii technology to start some family games of tennis or bowling Click on the link below to learn more Second look into nontraditional varieties of exercise I had a friend whose daughter wasnt very active then fell in love with horses She then spent a great deal of her time either riding or caring for grooming cleaning stalls etc Now is this exercise yes but not like we normally think of it She didnt measure her heart rate or look to see how long she had been in the barn It was a way for her to get moving that she loved that involved lots of hard manual labor Now shes healthy as a horse I know bad pun but I couldnt help myself Finally look into some activities you could do as a family Is there an indoor climbing facility in your town Its a great form of exercise and really exciting to boot What about laser tagpaintball or geocaching Geocaching is described as outdoor treasure hunting Using GPS coordinates you locate caches left behind by other enthusiasts or even companies Its fun and generally involves lots of walking For some additional information about geocaching and other activities click on the links below It can be really frustrating when your doing all that work and not seeing the results you want However getting rid of stubborn fat around the waist requires both exercise and good nutrition I know in your question you laid out all the things that you werent eating and that sounds great However since your not getting the results you want its time to gather a little more dietary information so you can suceed webMD has a bunch of tools to help you do just that The link pasted below is for webMDs food and fitness planner page When you visit the page you can set up an account for free that lets you determine how many calories you need a day to take in to lose weight It also lets you record the foods you eat and tracks the calories for you This will be a huge help Many people underestimate how many calories they consume a day so this is one way to make sure your not eating more then you need Also since it tracks the calories for you many times people report that after keeping a food diary they actually eat even healthier so they can maximize the number of foods they can eatday For example the average candy bar has about 220 calories A healthier snack of 1 serving of string cheese 1 cup of baby carrots and 12 cup of red grapes only has about 192 calories Eating high quality foodsveggies fruits lean proteins and healthy fats in the right portions will get you where you want to be Also you might find that by getting your diet squared away you can actually decrease the amount of time your exercising I here this a great deal at the school I teach at If you really want to gain some weight you need to develop a comprehensive nutrition and exercise plan First keep a food diary for three days Are you really eating as much as you think When counseling athletes at school I generally recommend they consume 1820 grams of protein a day per kilogram of body weight So for you at 150 lbs  68 kilograms that would put your protein needs in the range of 122 136 grams a day Now that you know what your eating and how much protein you need Develop an eating plan Heres an example Breakfast 1 large egg scrambled 1 cup old fashioned oat with one tablespoon honey 1 banana 1 cup skim milk Protein in meal  20 grams Lunch 2 grilled chicken breasts 8 ounces 2 cups of veggies broccoli green beans califlower 1 apple 1 serving greek yogurt Protein in meal  69 grams Dinner 1 servings baked pork tenderloin 3 ounces remove all fat 2 cups of veggies 1 banana 12 cup fat free cottage cheese Protein in meal  38 grams Snacks 1 apple with 2 tablespoons of peanut butter protein 7 grams 14 cup sunflower seed string cheese fruit

check with your physician before starting I understand that the program is based on points but Im not sure what their policy for exercise is I would speak to someone knowledgeable from Weight Watchers Im sure they have dietitiansnutrition professions available to trouble shoot challenges Although research suggests that people who stop exercising gain more weight over time than people who stay active everyone is different Exercise especially the type that strengthens the body helps build muscle which weighs more than fat After exercise is stopped there is some lean tissue loss It sounds like you are doing what you need to do in terms of dealing with stress including meditation but it might take time to see results I suggest taking a closer look at your diet to make sure you are eating filling foods What is your dinner meal like Foods that increase satiety or feeling of fullness tend to be rich in protein and fiber So a lean protein source lean meat or beans with fruits and veggies whole grains and healthy fats work well Also if you crave sweets but arent allowing yourself any that may be increasing your cravings Try including sensible amounts on a reglar basis Ideas include dark chocolate or small amounts of your favorite treat Also make sure you eat a hearty breakfast and lunch as smaller meals earlier in the day tend to increase hunger later in the day A mindful or intuitive eating style may be helpful to you There are a variety of books on the subject that can help Good luck In some cases waking up hungry would not be a problem but it sounds like it is affecting your quality of life In addition to your protein source at dinner try including a big salad andor soup whole grains and some healthy fat olive oil avocado etc Eating from all the food groups helps increase feelings of fullness You can also try a bedtime snack of something light like fruit with peanut butter or whole grain crackers and cheese If you are staying up late this can increase hunger so getting to sleep early can help You also want to make sure you get enough to eat earlier in the day including a good breakfast and lunch with in between healthy snacks Also make

you are thinking the thoughts you mentioned in your question seek help from a mental health professional There is no evidence that taking extra B vitamins helps or hinders weight loss While these

not enough to sustain normal periods While estrogen often decreases when body fat and weight dips too low that may not always be the case The female body needs a certain percentage of body fat to allow the hormones to work properly This mixed with strenuous exercise and perhaps a diet lacking in key nutrients and calories is enough to keep your body from having periods My suggestion to you is

calories High levels of activity mixed with low calorie intake may increase cortisol levels stress hormone and cause weight to stay where it is This is a theory but I have seen it many times Your wife

start feeding yourself better and reap the benefits of activity which can result in muscle gain It doesnt matter if you get adequate protein if you are missing out on other important nonprotein

gradually  about 12 pounds per week Also eating a well balanced diet with enough protein and nutrients is also key Exercise and toning muscles should also help If you just started a weight training program it is possible to gain some muscle that may show up on the scale While exercise plays a role in weight management so does diet So you want to take a look at your eating habts not just in terms of what you eat but how much Research shows that some people compesate for physical activity by eating more Make sure you eat regular meals at the table honor feelings of hunger and satiety and eat in

part of the reason women gain weight with age First off congratulations on your weight loss I think you have a couple of choices right now You can focus on maintaining your weight with healthy habits instead of losing as you deal with your back issues and surgery In order to lose weight you will need to lower the calories you take in to make up for the lack of activity Its best to do this with professional help such as a registered dietitian or through a medically supervised program I dont know how much weight you have to lose the calories youve been taking in or the state of your health which are all factors to take under consideration I think the first choice makes the most sense because lowering your calories without exercise can slow down your metabolism You can also see a physical therapist to get ideas for exercises you can do I encourage you not to go back to old eating habits and use this as an opportunity to live a healthy lifestyle without focusing on weight You may be tempted to eat because of your situation but if you can maintain your weight and learn how to deal with stress in a healthy way that is true success And just because you are not losing weight now doesnt mean you wont be able to in the future Good luck  Because you have multiple health problems you should stay in close contact with your health care provider while making changes Keeping your blood sugar in good control will help your triglycerides so that should be a main focus Be sure to check hemoglobin A1C levels to see what your average blood sugars have been A diabetes educator can help with your diet if your blood glucose has been high Other things to do which you may have already been doing is reducing alcohol lowering your sugar and refined carbohydrate intake participating in regular exercise eating more fish and replacing healthy fats olive oilcanola oil for saturated fats butter high fat meats etc There is research that shows highdose omega3 supplements with docosahexaenoic acid DHA and eicosapentaenoic acid EPA can help lower triglycercides but you will need a doctors prescription Best of luck to you If you pay close attention to your diet a sensible amount of weight gain would be about 5 to 1 pounds per week Here are some tips Eat frequently including 3 meals and 23 snacks Include 45 food groups dairy protein grains fruit vegetable and fat at meals and 23 food groups at snacks Add nutrient and caloriedense foods to your meals such as sliced avocado with salads or sandwiches full fat dairy products fruit smoothies with meals chopped nuts in baked goods and topped on cereals and yogurt and nut butters on breads Regular exercise and weight training can help your appetite and build muscle For more tips on diet for healthy weight gain see

Weight gain especially in the midsection is related to menopause because the ovaries no longer produce estrogen and this changes the way fat is metabolized Hemorrhoids are not commonly associated with menopause and can happen to anyone especially if they are inactive drink little water and consume a diet low in fiber I would not rely on a supplement to help a child lose weight First off dietary supplements arent regulated by the FDA and their safety is not known Second no supplement alone can solve a weight problem You need to find out your child is carrying extra weight and work to change

weight Is he a picky eater Sensitive to textures Has he been pressured to eat much of his life which can cause early satiety fullness Does he exhibit red flags for an eating disorder If there is an

relaxing atmosphere and without pressuring him to eat Include wholefat dairy products such a whole milk whole yogurt and cheese Add fat to foods including avocado with sandwiches oil to veggies and peanut butter on bread Ensure adequate protien by including sources at meals and snacks eggs nuts meat beans and dairy The key is always to address the problem at its root Good luck There are no

than others after surgery but the more often you eat wholesome foods such as vegetables grains and lean meats the easier they are to eat This isnt just about weight but health You have a small stomach now and not all of the nutrients you take in are absorbed You need to choose food that is nutrient dense and make every bite count That doesnt mean you cant eat any sweets but eat them less often than

nurturing You just have to give your body time to adapt to them instead of the easy foods that arent doing you much good Good luck We all have a genetic blueprint to how our big or small are body is supposed to be When we eat healthy eat mindfully meaning we dont eat past fullness often and are active weight tends to take care of itself It sounds like you are ready to make a change which is good

help you lose weight but maintain the loss Heres why Muscle keeps your metabolism revved up burning calories fat and glucose sugar When you lose weight up to 25 of the loss may come from muscle resulting in a slower metabolism Weight lifting will help preserve or rebuild any muscle you lose by dieting Muscle helps you with aerobic exercise The stronger you are the better you will be at any aerobic activity Weight training improves your bodys muscletofat ratio you end up with less body fat and more muscle which improves both your health and your fitness level Gaining muscle will help you look better as you define and tone your physique Building strength helps you feel good about yourself Although the scale may show a slight weight gain when you start lifting weights usually five pounds or less you probably wont look heavier because the gain is in muscle and your clothes may even fit more loosely There are several reasons why your weight can hit a plateau including Losing weight too quickly When this happens your metabolism the rate at which your body burns calories can slow down because your body senses it is starving Rapid or large amounts of weight loss can slow your metabolism by as much as 40 in six months Losing muscle When you lose weight up to 25 can come from muscle tissue And since muscle is the engine in your body that burns calories and helps maintain your metabolism losing it can hinder weight loss Weightlifting can help preserve and build muscle Reaching your bodys particular set point  the weight and metabolic rate your body is genetically programmed to be Once you reach that point its much harder to lose weight and even if you do youre likely to regain it If youre at a weight at which youve hit a plateau in the past if your body generally seems to gravitate toward that weight and youre within a BMI bodymass index range of 20 to 25 then you may be at your set point Decreasing your physical activity andor increasing your caloric intake People lose weight all the time by reducing their caloric intake without doing any exercise but its almost impossible to keep weight off without exercising Many scientists agree that physical activity is the single best predictor of whether a person will maintain a weight loss Other health factors including thyroid or adrenal gland problems medications like antidepressants quitting smoking menopause and pregnancy Even with any of the above factors the bottom line to losing weight is eating fewer calories than you burn Studies show that people almost always underestimate how many calories theyre eating So if youre struggling with weight loss youre still exercising and youve ruled out any of the above reasons for weight plateaus look at your calorie intake As for exercise and weight plateaus sometimes a change in routine can help Instead of the treadmill try the bike or the stepper Instead of a dance class try a stretch and tone class If youre not weight lifting this would be a good time to start If you already do aerobic exercise try adding intervals short bursts of higherintensity exercise to your aerobic workouts And keep reminding yourself that if you maintain an active lifestyle and continue with healthy eating you will reach your goals Unlike aerobic conditioning where duration and intensity is increased by 10 increases in the weight you lift arent prescribed with such precision partly because muscle groups vary so much in size and strength and partly because of the practical matter of the weights available at the gym Typically you increase to whatever dumbbell is next on the rack or plate on a weight machine so if youre lifting 12 pounds with biceps curls then the next dumbbell available is usually 15 pounds There is an option to increase in smaller increments with dumbbells by using an accessory called a donut a magnetic 1 pound weight that attaches to the end of the dumbbell they come in other weights besides 1 pounds as well Weight machines have half weights for the same purpose Ask your gym manager to purchase donuts if they dont have them Trial and error is the way to determine how much weight to lift Select a weight that looks close to what you think you can lift based on your goals If general conditioning is your goal then select a weight you think you can lift eight to 12 reps or 1215 reps for beginners If you can lift it 25 times with ease then its too light and if you can lift it only four times then its too heavy There are no formulas to calculate this Simply decide what your goal is so you know how many reps to lift take a guess by looking at the weights and then give it a try Youll get good at this quickly Most people agree that proper form during lifting is important but data to prove that proper form will prevent injuries or improve performance does not exist In the American College of Sports Medicine position statement Progression Models in Resistance Training for Healthy Adults it is written It is important to note that proper technique is used for any exercise velocity in order to reduce any risk of injury but no research is provided to back up this statement Theres another factor to consider when thinking about form That is if proper form were to be proven effective for injury prevention and performance improvement what would the form look like For instance during biceps curls youre supposed to stand up straight and keep your shoulders back and weightlifting books contain suggestions like sitting up straight and relaxing your shoulders when doing leg extensions but so little of this advice is evidencebased that its questionable if it should be recommended universally Perhaps more important is the fact that we all have different anatomy and biomechanics and so our bodies move differently when doing all sorts of activities No one not even professional athletes throws a baseball exactly the same or swings a golf club the same or serves a tennis ball the same and so why should weightlifting be any different This is not to say that one should be reckless when lifting but perhaps there is more to injury prevention than just proper form The consensus amongst strengthtraining professionals is that many weightlifting injuries are due directly to individuals who lift aggressively with weight that is too heavy for their musculoskeletal system and that improper form is only indirectly the culprit For instance if an individual is performing biceps curls with weight that is so heavy that they must lean way back to cheat the dumbbells up then they might put tremendous strain on the lower back and end up injuring a vertebral disc or straining a lumbar muscle The poor form may have put the body in a position of weakness and vulnerability but it was the excess weight that was the root of the problem Here are some simple tips to keep in mind when weightlifting In summary if you A take your time and lift mindfully and B feel it in the belly of the muscle youre trying to work and not in the joints and C you select weights that your body can handle without having to cheat or force the weight up then the chances of injury are probably going to be reduced DVT or deep venous thrombosis is a blood clot that forms in the deep veins often in the thigh or calf Risk factors for DVT fall into two categories inherited and acquired Inherited risks include different conditions that cause the blood to clot more easily The more common of these are mutations of factor V Leiden and the prothrombin gene These may run in families Some of the acquired risks include \tRecent surgery \tObesity \tExtended travel or bed rest \tCancer \tPregnancy \tHormone therapy and birth control pills You report that you have at least two of these risk factors for blood clotsyour weight and your family history Blood clots in the leg do not always have any symptoms at all Symptoms when they occur may include any of the following \tSwelling \tPain or tendernesspossibly only while standing or walking \tWarmth in the skin \tRed or discolored skin \tLeg fatigue Because of your risk factors and symptoms you should call your doctor right away DVT is dangerous because a blood clot can travel from the leg and become lodged in the lungs This can cause serious breathing problems and even death Your doctor may recommend a blood test called a ddimer an ultrasound or an xray test called a venogram to help diagnose the problem Click here for more information on the Symptoms and Diagnosis of Deep Vein Thrombosis Getting your blood sugar under control quickly is very important The damage to your body starts well before your blood sugars are in the diabetic range Thats why once we know you have diabetes or even prediabetes its very important to act quickly to get things under control Even once you start medicine its also very important to continue to work on your weight and exercise Its wonderful that youre focused on that Once you start medicine it doesnt mean you have to be on it forever Most people with diabetes can actually go off medicine if they get their weight down enough and make the right lifestyle changes I would encourage you to discuss this issue further with your doctor as only he knows your health as well as you do But it is important to get your blood sugar under control as quickly as possible and your best bet is probably to take the medicine as your doctor suggests remembering it can be just temporary for weight loss try this Exercise is the best way Some people can take fat burners which get rid of fat at the same time you are loosing weight This may not be what doctors recommend though Taking any dosage over the recommended by your doctor can cause serious medical problems These meds are not weight loss pills even though it may be tempting to use them in such a way Better safe than sorry Also if you are losing TOO MUCH weight some loss will happen then your doctor needs to change your dosage or try a new medicine for you Rod Moser PA PhD Thank you very much for your answer Im going to try doing some aerobics first I looked at some photos from when I was around 56 years old and I already had

blockers especially the older ones such as atenolol Tenormin and metoprolol Lopressor ToprolXL The average weight gain is no more than 4 pounds about 2 kilograms Newer beta blockers such as carvedilol Coreg dont typically cause weight gain as a side effect However the beta blockers that can cause weight gain usually arent prescribed unless other medications havent worked or if you have a specific heart condition that requires taking those medications Beta blockers are used to treat conditions such as high blood pressure and migraines Doctors arent sure exactly why some beta blockers cause weight gain It could be that beta blockers slow your metabolism Also if you switch from taking a water pill diuretic to a beta blocker as a treatment for high blood pressure you may gain a few pounds of weight that the diuretic kept off If youre taking a beta blocker for heart failure tell your doctor immediately if you begin to gain more than 3 to 4 pounds about 15 to 2 kilograms particularly if the weight gain continues beyond your first week of taking the drug This could mean that fluid is building up in your legs abdomen or chest which may signal that your heart failure is worsening Do

too much pornography Researchers said Thursday that young men who indulge in excessive consumption of Internet porn gradually become immune to explicit images the ANSA news agency reported Over time this can lead to a loss of libido impotence and a notion of sex that is totally divorced from reallife relations It starts with lower reactions to porn sites then there is a general drop in libido and

men which revealed that many became hooked on porn as early as 14 exhibiting symptoms of socalled sexual anorexia by the time they reached their midtwenties There was some good news however as the condition was not necessarily permanent With proper assistance recovery is possible within a few months Foresta said Hi I just thought I would show you this first see what porn dose is it shuts down

people who are overweight have impaired iron metabolism detectable on blood tests In many of these cases dietary iron intake was adequate perplexing researchers It now appears that inflammation associated with excess body weight elevates a hormone in your liver called hepcidin which has the net effect of reducing iron absorption into your body from your digestive tract The result is a metabolic nightmare of weight gain fatigue and poor thyroid function Do hope this helps you Good Luck Hi By the sound of you OK now your down to 3 cigs a day time to go all the way and kick it I did

to height ratio too httpwwwwebmdcomdietcalcbmiplus I would focus on eating heart healthy foods and slowly increasing your activity level Start slow so you dont burn out too quickly and after some time you will be able to increase your workouts Dont stress about losing weight just set small attainable goals for yourself and over time you will see the weight come off Good luck As a redblooded adult who has lost and gained 30 over 4 times and has struggles his whole life with weight problems I can see where you are coming from I am not sure if I can help you but I can tell you is the story of how I lost and kept off 50 pounds What I did that really helped my out was going to a doctor and asking him how many calories I should be eating a day with moderate exorcise walking 3 miles The doctor placed me at around 14002000 calories On average I consumed over 1350 calories a day NONE of those calories came from junk food I completely cut that out of my life In the mornings I would grab my dog and go for a brisk or casual walk around my local nature trail After I got come I would drink as much water as i wanted water helps a lot when losing weight Believe it or not the most helpful thing i did when losing weight was eating right no junk food and moderate exorcise If every healthy person followed this healthy life style they WILL lose weight No exceptions Period There are no excuses for a healthy person to not be losing weight I hope you the best of luck I have a aircast on right night What you might like about it is that it is designed to take away the moisture or air everytime he puts preasure on it Also the hard plastic sides actually feels good around because of the air flow but yet secure Thats hard to believe but it is true for me I am still not walking I probably tore something But regardless this aircast did protect me and with only 2 straps it is easier for you to remove and put back on Also is designed to wear in a shoe I could not tackle that but as a mother of a young boy I believe this is the better choice That 5 day cast would make the transition harder for your child because it is so much heavier If your concerns is based on protection The aircast can do the job in my opinion  There are upper body cardio excises you can do with weights and a medicine ball Theres a you tuber named Mario Ramone who can help with ways to do exercises while sitting I watch his videos to find out ways I can do excises while sitting because I have knee aliments You can also try getting a kefty for your workout httpkeftycom There are other videos that provide examples of excesses one can do in a wheelchair Her weight is over the norm A blood sugar of 131 if she was fasting is elevated I would have her evaluated by her doctor to be sure It could be type 1 or type 2 diabetes What are your blood sugar numbers well this is a symptom of many things feeling weak feeble before making any conclusions you could make a few change to your lifestyle like diet exercise and substance abuse try eating more raw plant material like vegetables less processed foods and meats kick out the pepsi colas and nutter butters work out more not to intensely though if this is caused by something other than a sedentary lifestyle try to overexert yourself really try to analyze yourself a little more keep a food journal catalog everything you eat in a day serving sizes and include annotations about how youre feeling on each day and your energy levels A better goal than focusing on scale weight is to keep track of body fat The goals should be to decrease body fat and optimize bone strength For a man a body fat percentage of 18 to 25 is not bad for 40plus For women 40plus 22 to 27 is not bad To get that body fat percentage you need to have excellent fitness to maintain a good muscle base Also a man should have a waist circumference below 40 inches and a woman below 35 inches Your daughter is obese and needs a full assessment Her major weight gain occurred roughly at the time her endocrine system kicked in with her menstrual cycle I would ask her physician to look into two conditions Cushings Disease and Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome The evaluations are straightforward and both are amenable to effective therapies Clearly her thyroid function needs to be assessed as well If the family history is strong for obesity it is common for girls to express the obesity gene at time of pubescence Teens can sneak eat with the best of them so what you see her eat may not at all reflect what shes actually consuming If the home environment includes lots of junk food sitting around and people who are themselves not practicing healthy nutrition and exercise habits then shell emulate those habits Finally research shows that in teen girls physical activity plummets by the age of 14 or so They literally stop moving But they dont stop eating Thus the problem Please get the medical assessment done completely and as soon as possible I have worked with many men and women who demonstrate a fear of food The root cause is psychological and often resonates around control issues complicated by anxiety and depression Youre already quite thin yet you want to drop fat and weight Why Think back to when you made that decision It sounds as though youve had the fear for a while and that you may already be a chronic food restrictor Im quite concerned about your desire to shed weight You absolutely should be working with a therapist who is expert in eating disorders These experts will help you tease apart your unique situation and develop a strategy to create a healthier relationship with food Go to the web site for the International Associaton of Eating Disorder Professionals and find a therapist in your location You really need to speak with someone as soon as possible if you cant find anyone see your doctor and let your medical team find someone for you A recent survey of Americans asked the question What would you give up so that you dont gain 10 pounds over the summer 52 of women said bag the sex and keep the skinny Only 25 of men agreed When asked what people would give up to get a flat stomach 54 said no more TV 54 would skip shopping 42 would turn off their cell phone 36 would unplug their computer 21 would say not tonight honey to any sex and 6 would forgo showering oh my Over 20 years ago there was a disturbing study that noted many people wanted to have an ideal body so badly that they would lose a limb In a word no Remember the last time you had the flu and couldnt keep anything down Yep you did drop some weight most of it water weight and perhaps a pound or two of fat depending upon the length of noneating time However as you recovered you probably also remember in vivid detail how your hunger kicked in big time and before you knew it youd compensated for the weight loss and then some This is actually a beautiful example of how incredible your body is when you provide it with a survival challenge As a physician and expert in fitness and nutrition Im all about optimizing health and wellbeing This issue of size tugs at my doctors protective instincts eg preventing disease and disability while as a woman I feel deeply for any woman who has ever sobbed while staring at her closet trying to find something decent to wear This issue of what constitutes a healthy size and weight is a hot topic of debate among scientists and experts in the field Dr Steven Blair has championed the notion that its all about fitness not size while others argue the smaller the better to ensure optimal health and longevity Since no one has a solution let me boldly go forward with a few suggestions 1 Your size issue must involve health and wellness Looking at physical appearance alone without considering overall health and fitness is leaving off half of your best body equation If youre really interested in living life to the fullest that requires you do the work to stay fit and nourish yourself healthfully You want to clothe a healthy happy woman  not just a size 2 Know thyself Just like you know your size you need to know your other body numbers Take a tape measure to your waist If its greater than 35 youre packing on inner abdominal pounds placing you at higher risk of developing heart disease and diabetes If your body fat is greater than 35 youre at higher risk for breast cancer and potentially ovarian cancer Too much weight can also have an accumulative effect on your weight bearing joints eventually leading to arthritis and disability Many of my patients are very fit a size 1014 normal waist size and a good body fat percentage Keep in mind the goal is not to be skinny Its to be healthy physically independent and out of the red zone for disease and disability 3 All women need to pay attention to their selfcare To stay out of the red zone youve got to take care of yourself Your mind and body benefit from daily physical activity ideally accruing about 400 cals throughout the day and injecting intervals of intensity as well as healthy nutrition high quality whole foods being mindful of portions and total calories consumed and eating a balanced mealsnack every 34 hour through dinner Science backs me up on this recommendation which is true for men and women alike 4 Women need attractive enjoyable clothing options to live and exercise in When a woman is beginning her journey toward improving her lifestyle habits she wants to feel good about herself Better larger size 16 and over clothing options help her accomplish that goal Many of my patients often call these clothes transitional As a woman gets more active and pares away more excess body fat shell transition to other clothing which may end up being size 1214 5 Remember that the goal is optimal health and fitness There are plenty of skinnies out there that are woefully unfit and unhealthy This is not about weight Its about the quality of your body as well as your mind Is your body fit enough to allow you to do the things you love in life Are you in pain due to a sedentary lifestyle Get real and be honest If youre walking around carrying 200 pounds or more you know that the excess weight will eventually cause problems Take a moment and examine your lifestyle Pinpoint easy things you can begin to do today to make it healthier Health not skinny is the goal Theres a new Duke University study that presented findings showing that although many doctors are trying to talk to their patients about weight managment its mostly ineffective The researchers found that the most successful doctors used a motivational and empathetic way of talking about weight Hey I know its difficult to drop the pounds so why dont we team on this together You know Ive been there Ill share some secrets of my own success Sound good Their patients dropped 35 pounds within 3 months of seeing their doc The least successful were those who were judgemental andor confrontational If you dont drop the weight youll get diabetes and heart disease Get a grip and start the program I gave you I want 5 pounds off by the next time I see you These patients dropped no weight and most gained You could eat 500 to 750 calories a day and lose weight No carbs sugars concentrated sweets But really will power is your biggest ally Exercise portion control and self control Fill up on water when you feel like a snack eat raw veggies but avoid carrots and beets because of the sugar content Not recommending this to anyone but I did lose about 2 pounds a day on HCG and B12injections with a strict 500 calorie a day diet Talk any diet plan with a physician to be certain you are healthy enough for the restricted calories any medications or exercise You mention your weight all day but how does your weight look every week Are you gaining 1113 poiunds a day every week or is your weight relatively the same every week Your weight can easily fluctuate that much during a single day and that doesnt mean much as far as overall weight goes Weigh yourself once a week and see how your weight looks one week to another My weight usually fluctuates around 812 pounds a day but week to week its usually about the same My boyfriend can have his weight fluctuate as much as 20 pounds a day but his weight stays about the same one week to another Remember to weigh yourself at apporximately the same time every week for example weigh yourself first thing in the morning BEFORE you eat every Friday or something like that Weighing yourself multiple times a day will only make you frustrated believe me I know Good luck She should have her thyroid tested by her doctor If it isnt working properly it could be causing her to lose weight Smoking can cause foods to taste more bland Also I know cutting out sugar from your diet will allow your tolerance to go down and the flavor will be stronger again for example powerade used to taste very bland to me i cut down on soda and started drinking water a lot the next time i tried a powerade the flavor was overwhelming Prednisone side effect is fluid retention among others such as mood swings insomnia and nightmares Regarding the weight gain it is vitally important to adhere to a strict low sodium diet and watch caloric intake Exercise in general is good for overall health however the increase in your weight is due to fluid retention You are on a large dose of Prednisone which is needed in your case You may consider speaking with your doctor an endocrinologist and nutritionist together you may come up with a solution that will work while you are on Prednisone Hopefully they will in the future taper your dose down which will help greatly Thank you for you feedback it is greatly appreciated I honestly feel really good about myself and think i look good I am really developing a complex though with all the comments of how much weight I lost and how skinny I am I do realize how shocking it must be for people to see me lose weight so quickly and im just tired of hearing all the comments Im also concerned with why my appetite just totally diminished then came back with such a vengeance and why I cannot seem to gain any weight with the amount of calories I am consuming on a daily basis Did I mess up my metabolism also I am not extremely active so it just doesnt make sense I know that this is probably a great problem to have but Im just not used to this sudden change in my body Your question is loaded with subsequent questions there is really no way for a person that does not know your medical history to give you a legitimate answer Many different problems could cause these symptoms such as hypoglycemia hyperglycemia diabetes or it may just be something as simple as the sort of diet that youre on and lack of necessary vitamins needed by the body I am going to take a shot in the dark and assume youre in the Navy I am a veteran myself and during my time in the Army one of the things they used to do was forced hydration You need to be careful of the amount of water youre taking in without replenishing your body with necessary electrolytes I do hope this has been helpful however for a more detailed answer you should visit your clinic and speak with a Dr who has your medical history they may also want blood work charts There is no whey that this added protein alone will build muscle Extra protein  above and beyond his nutritional needs  has the potential of overloading his kidneys especially if he is sweating and exercising and not getting in sufficient water All he needs to do is eat a good balanced diet three meals and some healthy snacks work out regularly no power lifting weights and he will get strongerand leaner He does NOT need something stronger like those bulkbuilders at the health food stores If your daughter is under six years old Bromfed DM is not recommended If she is over six you will need to get the okay from her doctor since I do not know anything about her or her medical history let alone blindly dose your daughter The childrens ibuprofen is fine at the correct dosage She is taller than the average 8 year old girl in the 90th percentile A matching weight in the 90Th percentile would be about 80 pounds Taller girls do look thinner but before we would determine if a child was underweight undernourished etc I would need to review their nutritional state family history etc Puberty  a few years down the road  tends to change weight and height a great deal so in the meantime just have her pediatrician carefully monitor her growth Personally you should not be trying to lose ANY weight  you are at an appropriate weight for your height and five pounds less is not going to change how you look or how your clothes feel It would be more beneficial for you to exercisetoneup what you have This way you will LOOK thinner feel better and it will appear that you have lost weight Dont let the scale tell you what to do Augmentin has two drugs amoxicillin and clauvulate Amoxicillin is dosed from 5080 mg per kilogram 22 pounds in a child with recurrent ear infectionsASSUMING an antibiotic is even needed You can do the math Newer recommendations do not favor using antibiotics unless the child meets certain medical criteria You can find the new recommendations  just published a few days ago  by an Internet search or read my blog on Family Webicine Some women who undergo an aggressive exercise program will have a missed or delayed period You are on an effective birth control pill so the chance of you getting pregnant is remotebut unfortunately not zero You can take a pregnancy test but it is a bit early In retrospect it is much easier to use condoms protects against STDs too than to have this unnecessary worry Your theory of weight reduction during wrestling causing your symptoms is really not likely While I dont agree with wrestlers trying to lose weight to compete in a lower weight class I dont think you caused any of your concerns If there are other underlying reasons you will need to see a good medical provider for a diagnostic workupthis would not be something that can be done over the Internet Eight years old for a boy is a bit too young to be showing signs of sexual maturation so it is wise to discuss this with his pediatrician In our practice we refer these early bloomers to a pediatric endocrinologist In variesdepending on the thickness and amount of padding but a fiberglass short leg cast only weighs a few pounds I put them on but I cant say I ever had the urge to weigh them Go by his birthday and consider holding back on solids for another month or so His formula is much more important to his overall nutriion than cereal or baby food at this time but get input from his pediatrician There is no need to rush solidshe will be eating for the rest of his life he primarily needs to get his nutrients from the formula I think you will find this helpful httpfitwebmdcomteenbmicalcbmi Your head wont explode if that is your concern but the increased vascular pressure may not be very comfortable for you If it hurtsdont do it A suggestion Decrease your max weight and increase your repetitions at a lower weight In other words lower the intensity of your workout at least for powerlifting until you feel better You body needs about 15 calories per pound of ideal body weight I do not know what you currently weigh If you eat less and burn more you will lose weight In a chronic situation where you are losing weight your body will attempt to lower your metabolic rate to compensate for this slowing down you weight loss In addition to calories you body needs a balance of protein more for men less for women fat and carbohydrates to achieve optimum health I dont know your sex or what your goals are but it may be best to seek the counseling of a good nutritionist I have never weighed themnor reallly cared I am sorry that I could not address your question but I am curious as to WHY you are inquiring about it I dont really have enough patientspecific information to give that okay so you will need to call the neurosurgeon who is treating his scoliosis for that answer Thirty degrees is a significant curve in a growing boy but I dont know where this curve is located on his back thoracic lumbar and if he is lifting weights properly I cant really offer you a patientspecific answer over the Internet since hormonal imbalance and nutritional intake resulting in weight gain can be a very complex issue You do need to address this problem with your medical provider a nutritionist or a weightcontrol specialist baritrician You are eating more than you body needs This is the ONLY way other than water retention that a mammal you can put on large amounts of weight We do not pull calories from the air While it may not seem like you are eating more a calorie excess of only 500 calories a day could add a pound a week to your scale a 1000 calorie a day increase could at TWO pounds a week The first step in getting some control is to do an honest and accurate food diary Write down EVERYTHING you eat including the amountsweight and their determine their caloric content Your doctor will likely need this information I do not know of any contraindications for exercise restriction while anyone is on Cipro or for months after Any restrictions that your doctor recommended has nothing to do with the medication but your other health concerns Since I do not know you full medical history it is best to get patientspecific exercise parameters from your doctor  someone who does have this information The most important step is to be properly diagnosed There can be MANY reasons for your elbow pain but tendonitis would be high on the possibilities Once you are properly examined and diagnosed the medical provider can than select the best individualized treatment plan Dont just blame this on your age since tendonitis can affect people of all ages It may include antiinflammatory medications and home physical therapy modalities How do you even get a 12year old boy to fast They eat all of the time Those levels are certainly not critical or even indictative of diabetes type I but because diabetes runs in your family your son should have a very good diet as well and be exercising along with you Randomly check his blood sugars including one two hours after a meal Give those readings to his medical provider for review Pregnancy requires spermsperm inserted deep in the vagina so that it can take a short journey to fertilize an ovum egg So you also have to be ovulating at the time No ejaculation or spermno pregnancy No eggno pregnancy Stop playing games like this It is only a matter of time before there will be an ejaculationor vaginal sexand then you can really be worried If you are at the point of dangerous sex games it is time for you to either go on birth control just in case and insist that your partner use a condom even during these sex games I think it would be fine for you to see a professional at least for you personal assurance An endocrinologist would be your best choiceThe atypical distribution of body fat the lack of facial hair etc could be related to a hormonal imbalance or it could be genetic but that is going to take some diagnostic testing Get it treated Gonorrhea can be easily cured in most cases What makes you think you still have it Please see your medical provider so that you can be properly examined tested and cured Everyone deserves a good nights sleep so if you have found that air mattresses offer you the best chance of a restful sleep then go for it Without mentioning brand names not permitted I would suggest that you consult a mattress supplier especially one that offers beds that do have adjustable air supports or try and find a more durable air mattress to use as a topper do an online search Your orthopedist is the boss This is the expert that has evaluated and treated your fracture If the ortho said that you can bear weight at two weeks then this is what they want you to do Incidentally the fibula is not a weightbearing bone The tibia does all of the work The low body temperature I dont know the numbers of course is not dangerous but a medical reason for the lethargy should be determined by the childs pediatrician There can be MANY different reasons and unfortunately this cannot be investigated blindly over the Internet Many people overeat when they are upset depressed or anxious The easy answer would be for you to see your medical provider so that you can have your depression properly treated first however I know this is not a simple solution Losing weight is not easy If it was no one would be overweight It comes down to simple math you need to eat less than your body needs to maintain your current weight and you need to expend more calories As little as a 500 calorie reduction per day of what you are eating now could result in a 50 pound weight loss in a year Before starting any weight loss diet it would be best for you to see your medical provider for an examination determine the amount of weight it would be ideal for you to lose and determine the best way for you to achieve this important goal At the same visit you can address those triggers that make you feel depressed If need be you can ask for a referral to counselor Anyone can lose weight All they need to the proper method and the personal motivation If you need help then some of the commercial weight loss programs like Weight Watchers can be of great help to you The group dynamics can be quite motivating There are no supersolutions my friend Your height and weight is more likely to be genetically determined blame it on your parents so it not likely you will ever get taller than you are now By age 18 the growth plates have closed Gaining weight is another issue and even this may be difficult for you to circumvent nature Eating a wellbalanced diet with sufficient calories is really the best you can dothe rest is up to your metabolism When you are 50 or 60 you may laugh about the time you wanted to gain more I dont know how long this person has been trying to conceive but if it has been a year or more of unprotected intercourse attempting to become pregnant it is time for her and her partner to seek the help of a fertility specialist There are dozens of reasons for a couples failure to conceive Size and height may not be playing an important role but general nutrition can be If she is not eating properly or losing weight this can certainly affect fertility Adolescent male gynecomastia is quite common and will go away in timeusually a few years Since I cant examine you I have no way of knowing the true nature of your fatty breasts There are many different types and degrees of male gynecomastia so it may not look like photos you have found You can have liposuction or a surgical procedure to remove excess fat if you want but this would be considered a cosmetic procedures and most insurances would not be agreeable to paying for it Unfortunately exercises and diet are not likely to fix male breasts so get it checked out by a medical professional Growth is more or less geneticallydetermined so properly done weightlifting should not have any adverse effect on linear growth after a young man  has reached puberty Protein powder will not stunt growth but it will also not build muscles or bulk you up If not taken properly excess protein can harm your kidneys so be careful Dont believe everything you read on those protein supplement claims I would need to know her HEIGHT as well in order to know if her weight is appropriate The age is really not the relevant I dont know your ageor the content of that online prohormone that you were taking I also do not know anything about your medical history in order to make a patientspecific comment If you have to wait four months to see a medical provider get the wheels in motionjust in case Unfortunately I would have no idea when you will return to normalthe state before you took thse supplements Has it been scientifically tested for effectiveness or is this anecdotal responses and testimonials Most of these miracle claims are bogus so I would advise you to be skeptical Is it safe Probablyit doesnt seem to hurt the bees but if it hasnt been tested who really knows Some of the biggest scams out there involve socalled miracle weight discoveries I seriously doubt that bee pollen is the miracle weight loss panacea If you are significantly reducing your calorie intake and exercising it really doesn matter what you takeyou will eventually lose weight No circumcision will not cause weight loss other than the weight of the foreskin that was removed but it is normal for newborns to lose a bit of weight in the first week and then gain it back to the birth weight level at the two week visit If this child has not returned to his birth weight he will need to have weekly weights and his intake monitored if he is on formula If he is breast fed and nursing well this is good Nothing to worry about at this point but his weight will need to be carefully monitored If his is NOT gaining weight the pediatrician will take it to the next evaluative level Usually but you had quite a crush injury The body has a remarkable ability to regrow a lost or damaged nail assuming the matrix the base of the nail that has the cells needed to regenerate the nail has not been damaged A damaged matrix may cause the nail to grow back somewhat deformed or have a ridge When we lose a finger we do not grow a new one but when we lose a nail the body likes to replace it Time will tell if your nail regrows again and comes in normally I take my car in when it is not brokenjust for routine maintenence The same goes for humans A physical exam finds things we may not be aware we have Once you get insurance having a physical exam and some lab work is a very good idea Now dont tell you mother or grandmother but the answer is NO Going from a warm workout area to the cold air is not going to cause illness so you can stop worrying about being sued It is an old and medicallydisproven belief that cold air drafts or chills lead to illness If that were true think of all the Aleuts Laplanders and Siberians You would think they would be sick all of the time As a matter of fact many are healthier The Finish and Swedes even bake themselves in a sauna and then run out and roll in the snow or jump in an ice lake Crazy Maybe but the practice is harmless They feel that it is is healthy Maybe they are correct As a wrestling coach your contaminated mats are much more of a health hazard so before those boys head for the locker room make them disinfect those mats and make them take their workout clothes home to be properly washed I have to say that being overweight is definitely a factor but there are soooo many reasons for shortness of breath in children that it would be wrong to just attribute it to his weight His doctor needs to do some pulmonary function tests or refer him to someone who can do this Shortness of breath due to exercise can be cardiac heart as well as an example He may need more than just a rescue inhaler like albuterol to manage this problem but you would be wise to take his medical evaluation up a notch Fruit smoothies are fine with the exception of those calories which can be surprisingly high Not all smoothies are created equal you know If you are trying to lose weight I think it would be wise to limit these as a sole breakfast option Once in a while is fine You will lose more weight and get a bit more mileage if you ate a piece of fruit and had some protein in the morning like an egg and a piece of dry toast Less calories You can take oral contraceptives at any weightI never heard of a minimum weight requirement You missed a few essential bits of information Are you male or female How old are you What do your parents look likesmall or large people Yes but that is only part of the equation Permanently losing weight requires more than a shortterm committment otherwise you will just gain it back Wellthe more stool that you hold in your intestines the more you will weigh You can take prenatal vitamins anytime during the day Vitamins will not influence your ability to lose weight or increase your chances of pregnancy however but a healthy lifestyle will be ver beneficial Without the ability to see his little foot firsthand I really couldnt comment if this will delay his walking but my blind guess would be NO Babies have a remarkable ability to circumvent these minor anomalies He will most likely be running through your house in about five months or so Make sure to specifically ask his pediatrician about this or ask to be referred to a pediatric orthopedist for a consultation No Your psychological nervousness has nothing to do with the nerve injury in your elbow These are two very different issues His inability to bear weight on this one leg does not necessarily mean the problem is in the hip It could be in the leg knee ankle or foot The reason many xrays are normal is that the problem may not even be due to a bone injury but rather muscle or tendon like a sprain These things do not show up on an xray I even had a nonwalking toddler with a thorn in his foot that no one noticed Toddlers can be wild and crazy and injury themselves in a zillion different ways without you even knowing it The fact that he has not improved in a week is concerning so I would suggest that you take him to see his regular doctor He may need to complete the entire leg xrays series if the doctor feels it is justified One quick story A patient of mine same age woke up from a nap and would not bear weight Several negative xrays negative exams and watchful waiting for three days did not seem him improve I coerced a orthopedic friend to work him into his busy and overbooked schedule so he agreed to see him over lunch This little guy who had been carried for the last three days ran through his waiting room jumped up on some chairs and acted like he did not have a care in the world To this day his parents and myself have no idea why he did not want to walk Perhaps he enjoyed being carried for a while I seriously doubt you will find any doctor willing to do this for you especially steroids anabolic steroids that you have been able to purchase somewhere else I dont think there is really any safe steroid regime that would be recommended for a teenager I would advise you to really look in to the serious sideeffects before considering using them Growth hormone therapy is safe if you do have an HGH deficiency This hormone is VERY expensive so it would be best to pressure your insurance company to approve it with the help of your pediatric endocrinologist assertiveness of course Food is calories Food does not cause you to burn calories Exercise and other activities burn calories Restricting your caloric intake of food will help you lose weight but it needs to be done carefully Think about getting some medical or nutritional help with your weight reduction goals Before undergoing any drastic weight loss program I am assuming that you would eventually like to lose over a hundred pounds it would be best to see your medical provider Some baseline lab work can be important With that said the amount of calorie restriction would depend on how fast you would like to lose that weight A good weight loss would be about two pound per week That would add up to nearly a hundred pounds in a yeara reasonable and achievable goal at this point Find out what you are eating now the number of calories determined by a honest food diary for a week Reduce those calories by about a 1000 a day I am guessing but I suspect you are ingesting well over 2500 to 3000 calories a day right now based on your weight and the fact that it appears to be stable Keep exercising This is very important and I am so proud that you are doing it The body does not give up weight easily but if you are consistently eating LESS than your body needs to maintain weight your weight will drop and continue to drop until you stop dieting It may not drop every dayor every weekbut at the end of each month you should be considerably less than the weight you started with at the first of the month If not something is amiss so you may need to see a nutritionistdietician or your primary care medical provider to help The first and most important step is getting startedand you have done that on your own I have little doubt that you will succeed Yes You have to take statins for life Life style changes are necessary but dont solve your cholesterol problem There seems to be mystery behind the cholesterol theory of artery blockages I believe statiins reduce inflammation of coronary arteries and reduce the chances for cholesterol to stick to artery walls That statins reduce LDL is incidental Web MD has not thrown any light on this shady area I wish they say some thing on the cholesterol myth Do you know how thin your blood is I am NOT very knowledgeable in BP but if you are standing and sitting logically because

Anxietyattacks for about 14 years I have always been the person that sits in the back of a crowd not wanting to socialize I would rather have someone approach to say hi I can never get the courage to

Ive been told by my doctor time and time again is that no more than 2lbs a WEEK should be lost to have a healthy weight loss In fact I was just speaking about that with him today because my husband and I are trying to build our own health and exercise regime that will be healthy for us and not affect our kids negatively I hope you got your answer  Hi I have had these sorts of feelings when I was overwhelmed with work or family stress But I felt compelled to also send you a link to this article on heart attacks and women  not to scare you  but because you can never be too careful with your health It is my understanding that you do have to take long term  if you go off the meds your cholesterol is going to go back up  unless you can make lifestyle changes to address but it sounds like yours is more genetic family history I unfortunately cant give you good guidelines but I can tell the previous answer is incorrect Cipro has repeatedly been associated with increased risk of tendon injury its probably safest to wait a at least a few weeks to exercise until it completely clears out of your system Bottom line though is to check with your doc Ive actually been diagnosed with panic disorder for about five years At first I was having 3 or 4 severe attacks a day Now I rarely have then and when I do theyre what I call baby attacks The best way to get through an attack for me is to MOVE Run walk jump and down whatever That pressure is not bad even though the systolic top number is a little elevated If I had a patient with that pressure I would not be alarmed I am a nurse But since hypertension runs in your family if I were you I would keep track of your pressure and if it goes higher go get checked out by your doctor you could be prehypertensive Also losing weight may help bring your pressure down a little Well it is good there is no fracture Very little swelling or bruising However if the muscles are torn Or some ligament damage it may take longer than 78 weeks Wear an ace bandage on it while you are playing for a couple more weeks As in every other similar case what i want to suggest is to try increase your metabolism there are many options in order to succed it Her doctor prescribed Bromfed for her I took her to the ER on Monday and found out that it wasnt a virus like the Dr had told me on Friday She has pneumonia and a double ear infection Now she is on Zithromycin and Amoxicillin and also breathing treatments She is started to feel a little better she is starting to eat again today well it could be ticks  talk to your doctor about it I lay on the edge of the bed on my back Hubby stands next to bed and pulls me towards him if your husband is tall you can use pillows to adjust height My husband has a bad back and this is a good position for him alsofor oral sex I sit on the floor or pillow with my back against the bed This supports my neck Have you tried altering ice and heat I fell and turned my ankle in under me I spent 8 weeks on crutches with a knot on top of my foot The Doctor told me I had pulled the tendons in the top of my foot He said for me to do the ice and heat Tylenol and Ibuprofen and continue to walk on it but to walk then elevate walk and elevate It might be a menicus tear I have one go to an orthopedic surgeon get an MRI It should confirm a tear in the menicus I dont smoke so smoking really isnt a factor here In addition I tend to eat very healthy lots of veggies and nearly every meal is homecooked there is no fast food in my diet or overly sugary products Has the Drs tested for wheat or gluten intollerance If possible have a separate test done for wheat and a separate test done for gluten You can have the intollerance for one and not the other Is your child lactose intollerant have anemia or thyroid condition You can research for Celiac Sprue disease for more information and clues Celiac is an intollerance to both Hope this helps You need to take in more calories than you are burning You can reference an online caloric intake calculator It will tell you how many calories you need depending on your activity level You can get the excess calories from protein shakes and meal replacement shakes If this doesnt seem to help it could be a sign that there is something possibly wrong in your body and your fast metabolism is just a symptom you could have hyperthyroidism or something else and may need to consult a doctor In short 1 Eat more food if this doesnt work talk to a doctor This depends on how severe your sprained ankle is If your ankle has only been rolled and you are not feeling any discomfort or pain Then you should be fine with continuing your exercises If you are feeling discomfort or pain while doing these activities or you are putting yourself at risk to further injure yourself it is not a wise thing to continue Instead try other less stressful activities ie swimming exercises the first labtab sound is your dystolic you then listen untill the last labtab sound which is your systolic Nope ur THC levels will be low give it 13 months n u will be clear Keeping a food diary and recording EVERYTHING you eatdrink may be helpful You could try a test from the store if you wanted to put your mind at ease about this fact They arent completely foolproof but they might put you at ease Odds are your just having a screwy period and your hormones are out of wack If this happens consistantly you may want to have a doctor investigate this Best of luck maybe you can use maxlight for loss weight not sure but i think you can stay calm and dont worry about it the more you worry the worst its going to get because it takes time you got to wait find the ones you are most comfotable with the more comfortable you get the better they are You should see the doctor you may have some cartilage damage in the meantime time I would try otc patch like salonpas it sounds like an infection try alcohol and cleaning it soak it in warm water with salt also take an alergy pill just in case if you have them worstcase senario you might have an alergy to whatever scratched you but i general is just sounds like an infection No You should remaind that its a continuous process If you stop it your weight will start increasing I am not overweight I weigh 125 I am getting overheated regularly while exercising and sweating profusely I believe that what is going on is called premental pausally syndrome Ive used mouth wash before also I also get a choking feeling and sometimes throw up a bit  its pretty often too I think its normal It probably happens because the mouth wash is too close to your throat in ur mouth So yeah lols Just keep at it Diets take time to progress and it is good that you have been cutting sugar and fats while doing some physical exercise I am not sure if you consume alcohol or anything that has loaded calories but those should be avoided as well The way I work my diet is on Sunday after eating healthy all week I reward myself with pizza ice cream bar or something tasty I would recommend you keep watching your diet since that is 75 of losing weight and absolutely do not eat any trans fats such as any fast food place because that will take you back about a week Your saturated fats are the next on the list and should be significantly cut down to about half of your body weight Keep getting mono and polyunsaturated fats because they are completely natural and can be found in almonds seeds and fish Some healthy foods on my diet include rice greek yogurt chicken not breaded fish almonds pasta oatmeal and eggs Eggs are great in the morning because they contain the amino acid carnitine which helps your body turn fat into energy I usually wake up and drink a coffee for a boost in metabolism and also take a green tea capsule because it is a natural fat burner The next point of focus is your workout program Instead of doing a 3 mile walk you should really look into High Intensity Interval Training This process speeds your body up boosting your metabolism drastically for 1224 hours and that will help you lose weight This requires very tiring exercises that are performed at a fast and hard level There are other exercises for abs that work 200 better than crunches If you are trying to lose stomach fat you should do higher reps at a fast pace as another boost of metabolism Planks side planks oblique sit ups bicycles and mason twist will hit all of your abdominal muscles much better than crunches as they only focus on upper central abdominals Keep doing yoga because that is a great trick for relaxation and helping muscles out Also womens weights fluctuates a lot with menstruation so dont go to the scale more than once a week Remember losing weight takes time as most people on the proper diet and exercise program will lose a couple pounds a month Eat healthy and keep at it Hope this helps It takes whatever time it takes The fitter you are the faster it will drop though it will always take a while to return fully to the resting rate Your resting heart rate should be somewhere in the 60s or 70s Thats the rate when you have been sitting or lying for a while As you get fitter it could drop even lower Some athletes have resting heart rates in the 40s Mine is currently in the high 50s because I lift weights and exercise 6 days a week Hope this helps I am a type 2 diabetic and every time my insulin is increased I gain 10 pounds Even though doctors tell you insulin doesnt make you gain weight I dont believe it I do not know the best answer to tell you but i am wanting to lose weight too here some tips what i am doing for a start limit on pop my main issue no fast food no junk food no sweets cake ice cream chips and dips ect have more water in my diet someone told me to also take gatorade  tea also a good subsitution than pop on top of that im going to start exercising my mom went on a diabetic diet and lost 20 plus pounds in 3 to 4 months and no exercise but walk around her office at work You should see a physician before starting any diet to make sure you have no underlying medical issues But if you are found to be in good health the best way to lose the weight is not to diet but simply to burn more than you eat meaning keep active and watch your calories No need to spend money on fancy diet programs or special diet foods Just find a website like myfitnesspal or fatsecret fatsecret is my favorite and log your food in daily counting EVERYTHING you eat Stick to about 1400 calories a day based on your height  current weight and eat as many vegetables as you can handle along with fruit and eat healthy proteins like lean chicken turkey or fish with occasional lean beef and try to avoid processed sugar like candies pastries crackers chips Eat as much whole food and as little processed food as possible Drink a lot of water throughout your day You can invest in a Nutribullet or even better a Vitamix much more expensive and make fruit  veggie smoothies for breakfast  lunch along with sensible snacks like babybel light cheese almonds or soy nuts for a snack  4oz of lean chicken turkey or fish or lean beef with a vegetable for dinner If you want a snack at night choose something like 2 cuties clementines or another fruit a babybel cheese or a serving of nuts 1oz Take a pregnancy test and consult your doctor I see your 17 when you go to your appt remind your doctor that your visit is confidential Remember that muscle weighs more than fat Youre gaining a lot of muscle with all this exercising so some weight gain is normal If youre concerned about it ask your doctor those are big injury but im sorry to say that you are going to be limited on physical activity when you said you destroyed your ankle joints are different from bones as it affects the movements when compared to bone that supports the structure Talk to your family doctor and make appointment to see a nutritionist You are what you eat and having

curious since its been a little over a year Has your sons nail grown back Is your bicep really big That may explain it  Original poster here Thank you for the answers You both have given me good advice I am wondering do Doctors and medical advisers ever answer these questions Also after learning more about this subject I am wondering if I could be suffering from a mild case of erectile dysfunction I can get an erection pretty easily but I can tell that it is not not as hard as it could be I also can lose an erection prett easily if i dont keep myself stimulated Which to me means not enough blood Anyone else agree with that line of logic I am planning on going after the simpler causes of ED overweight high cholesterol bad diet stress little exercise  which I have in my life Even if it doesnt help me out I will at least be healthier in general Thank you so much please keep the answers coming well i would guess her on top is likley to be the best idea you wont have to hold urself up  or doggie  i know most ppl dont like to call it that but hope this helps my husband is a persional trainer and a nutrionalist and based on what hes told me  it depends on ur workouts and ur diet  what kind of workout are you doing what are u eatting to help you reach ur goal and how many times a week do u workout many factors play a role in this answer  but if your eatting good drinking plenty of water and working out 3 or more times a week for at least 30 mis i would think you should see some changes within 6 weeks  best thing to do it take a daliy picture of your self and compaire them thats really the best way to notice the changes  since it happends lil by lil thats what my husband does  hope this helps if your trying to gain weight  taking on carbs  good carbs is a good idea as long as you workout they should stay in your belly  just be sure to eat the most carbs in the daytime  so your body can break them down and use them for engery  if eatten later in the day or night time your body will store them as fat im 52 110 i finally just got myself up to that weight  i was always very skinny  no hypothyrid just nautrally  by doing just that i was able to pick up the weight i needed i was 90lbs  so yeah  n dont worry to eat something bad crabish chcoclate ant all bad lol  just dont make it a habbit and you should be find i hope this helps  i cant say for sure what is going on but you seem to be in tune with the things your not doing right i would go speak to your doctor about it first thing then def try to up take in water water is life without it everything in your body will slowly begin to break  also eatting right it not that hard to add healthy things into your everyday habbits there so many thing you can do that dont take much time at all ex try not eatting carbs after 4 pm meaning no pasta no bread no cookies and cakes chips anything high in carbs  your body makes insulin that breaks down crabs and turns them into engery  after late after noon your body stops making this and all carbs eaten after that time frame become stored as fat also with a uptake on water will help flush out anything bad in your system try to eat thing that have color i ate very bad for a long time and with a lil bit of trying was able to make a world of difference  i feel better and look better  also smoking i cant say anything about that im a smoker as well and we both know its very bad but i know quitting isnt easy or i would have done it already but i do try not to take my cigarettes outside with me when im doing things so i dont smoke as much  it helps me a lil its not a bad idea to try to also swelling could happen from lack of water and a lot of salt in your diet  try to take care of these things little everyday choices and change your life  i hope this helps Im 18 and recovering from anorexia and bulimia I have been at a stable weight for roughly a year and a half When I was your age I became severely underweight and had to be admitted to an inpatient treatment center All that you have written sounds exactly like how I felt and how I thought when I was suffering from the disease most I would constantly research diet strategies exorcises and ways to cope with the depression that soon hit me Like you and all others that suffer from eating disorders I was obsessed Anorexia is basically not eating food in an attempt to lose weight If this is what your friend is doing then yes she is starting this very unhealthy habit Becoming anorexic is not a good way to lose weight and can cause many health problemsIm sure youve already read some of them Encourage your friend to eat fruits and vegetables drink lots of water and exercise If she or he continues to not eat try to encourage her to see her doctor Good Luck From another post similar to this one from the Physician Assistant who responds to question here on Web MD Blood pressure will be high after excersising Moving around will cause the BP to go up which is why they always have you sit when you are at the doctors office Even just standing can raise your BP I would let your doctor know this at your next visit though as I am not sure if it should be going that high Good Luck It definitely depends on your approach to weight loss What foods did you eat and did you exercise also Exercise which increases the heart rate for about 20 min a few times a week will help to reduce cholesterol glucose and bp Also if youve been eating processed foods ie WeightWatchers prepared meals you might want to check the sodium content nitrates and other chemicals all known for that ominous jump in blood pressure we all dread Id be willing to bet that the meals especially without exercise as with any other change in diet only to lose weight are at least playing a part in the blood pressure increases especially since this is a common complaint among dieters My suggestion would be to stop dieting and to make small HEALTHY lifestyle changes such as eating more fruits and veggies especially fresh lots of green leafy foods  fresh spinach is excellent Make sure that you cut back on processed foods simple carbohydrates donuts cake candy as these just feed any sugar addiction you may have very bad for you eat high protein foods healthy fats omega3 from avocados olive and coconut oils Also eat small healthy snacks between meals and drink lots of water This will keep you from overeating at meal time keeps your metabolism going which helps to burn more fat and helps you to lose weight fat cells the right way lowering risk of any negative side effects which come with many dietsfads I was diagnosed with Type II Diabetes about 6 12 years ago and these are the things which I had to learn to get rid of the excess fat I had put on after ending up physically disabled for many years and less active They work my A1C is down to normal levels and I do not take the meds any longer I know it works and any exercise you can add to your food regimen will help you too I wish you great success and hope that this helps It stands for Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis or NSF Now it many mean something entirely different to your doctor Have you been diagnosed with this If you are purposely trying to lose weight by reducing food intake you may not be getting enough of the vitamins and healthy fats needed to keep your skin healthy and moist Eating a low fat diet can contribute to dry itchy dull skin I use Extra Virgin Olive Oil on my salads and a fish oil supplement to give my body the good fats it needs You can use vitamin E topically to help with dry itchy skin but you still need to ingest the healthy fats your body needs to function properly I would recommend going to a chiropractor I had a similar problem about a year ago and went to my chiropractor He took an Xray and found that my lower disc had not formed properly I lift weights and over the years it had taken its toll The disc had slipped causing extreme pain in my lower back that would shift on occasion from left to right He treated me for a couple weeks and realigned the disc No cure for me other than surgery so I have just cut back on lifting heavy and changed some of my exercises try excersizeing more fast oftenand harder I am currently having the same issue with my eight year old daughter She has been on Vyvance since August and I have recently noticed rapid weight loss Her father and older sister are also on Vyvance but are having no issues with weight loss Her doctor and I have discussed changing medications but it works so well in all other areas I am nervous about how a new medication will work Like you breakfast is no problem but the other daily meals are a struggle She has no problem snacking throughout the day but it is not enough to give her total nourishment I have started to have her eat a meal after school and before bed and am even considering allowing her to eat more fattening snacks even though they are usually not allowed If you have discovered any more tips that might help curb this issue it would be greatly appreciated I will keep you updated on what I find out as well Thanks  There has to be a reason for the cholesterol to be high A vegetarian diet can be one of eating absolutely no dairy or animal meat products or one of just avoiding meats If you are a TRUE vegetarian and eat no dairy or animal products you will have to look at your source of fats and protein Are you using any fats that are not healthy fats such as hydrogenated oils or oils that form transfats when digested IF you find the source of the cholesterol you can eliminate your problem Your body cannot make bad cholesterol if you do not supply it with the ingredients to do so Try limiting your fats to only a good nut fat such as almond andor a good seed like flax or sunflower for a month and see what your results are Another thing you say you are eating whole grain only Is this processed grain Try eating unprocessed grains or less processed grains than products made from highly processed flours Or try a product made from a non grain seeds such as millet flour The more a grain is processed the more good parts of it are destroyed or reduced leaving you with a starch that will undoubtedly ferment while digesting How many processed foods do you eat Is your vegetarian diet from fresh fruits and veggies or is it from Canned or processed foods laden with salts and unlabeled fats 3rdly and last what is the ph status of your blood Most diets consist of highly acidic causing foods which causes your body to store excess acid in the fats of your body You say you are overweight this could be a major reason since even though you are Vegetarian you are still overweight Get a few ph strips or paper and check your first urine in the morning If it is under 70 on the ph scale this may be part of the problem Genetics can play a role also but I really think this is more of a crutch for most people I was told I would be on my cholesterol meds for the rest of my life as my whole family had high blood pressure and high cholesterol I changed my lifestyle of eating and am now off all my meds with a total cholesterol of 145 by doing so I am diabetic also and have been able to eliminate all my meds I follow a lifestyle of eating called the ph diet You ought to look into it to see if it can help you too Just Google it and read about it It is a sort of vegetarian diet but just a little different There are several good books on the ph diet out there some a little more radicle and hard to follow but most with a common sense attitude of diet one can follow One thing you have to want something bad enough to make it happen Good luck Speaking to a medical practitioner has to be the best thing that you have to advise your daughter Do an action now before it is too late It is just like the same quick action that you have to do in dealing with unwanted fats You can also check out wwwbodytreatmentcentercom for a fat removal in NYC There might be some problems with your diet Try the Zeltiq in NYC or visit wwwbodytreatmentcentercom for an effective way to reduce fats I agree about the effects of smoking It will be better if you quit smoking and embrace a healthier lifestyle You should always be mindful in choosing the kinds of foods that you have to take in so you can stay in shape You may also try Coolsculpting or check out wwwbodytreatmentcentercom I had a close friend who had same problem with her son who at time was 3 years old now 5 years old I told her to give him Lactose and Glucotin free foods stop all daily vitamins he might be taking Pedlite that first thing in the morning small 4oz to start with Decrease all spices in his food to almost none No fried food at all If you go to your grocery market get the Gerber Graduates for him but dont let him see it cause hes a big boy not a baby and will not eat if he sees the baby food jar Best of luck to you and your son I had to raise my friends son for almost 2 years cause she couldnt handle him being in pain with or without food So me being in medical field and having 5 medical degrees didnt mind hes all better now and back with his momma now What is considered normal on lab tests may not necessarily be normal for you Let me give you some background information The test they usually perform to initially diagnose hypothyroidism is TSH or thyroid stimulating hormone It has an inverse relationship with your actual thyroid hormone Think of it as a bill collector If you dont respond when the bill collector knocks on your door they will start to knock on your door or call you with increasing frequency until you do respond The TSH is the bill collector and if your thyroid isnt paying the bills aka isnt producing enough thyroid hormone T4 TSH levels will continue to increase until the thyroid responds or your pituitary master gland decides its a hopeless cause and TSH production decreases or stops The reason for this diatribe is because people get confused when they are told they have hypothyroidism and their TSH is too high They dont realize the TSH is not actually the thyroid hormone which is the hormone that will be low in this case I just want to ensure there is no confusion when your provider gives you lab results Some providers dont realize that if your TSH is in the upper range of normal people and especially women may still have symptoms Thus you may want to work with your doctor on getting your TSH down to the lower ranges of normal 07 2 approximately  The range used to be 05 to 5 for TSH The national board of endocrinology now suggests the normal range be changed to 03 to 3 because people are still having symptoms despite being within normal range I prefer to keep my TSH around 1 because thats when I feel normal Everybody is different so that may not work for you What it boils down to is you are a person not a lab result if you have symptoms tell your primary care doctor Do some research write down questionssymptoms when you think of them and talk to your PCP about it If you do not think he or she is taking you seriously get a second opinion I would definitely seek help to start detoxification from all of that Just be up front and honest with physicians and they will help you come off It wont be easy but nothing in life worth having is easy Just remember that you are strong and you can do it Life will be better sober Best of luck Are you going from eating super healthy to going back to being relaxed about what you eat If so you are probably not used to processed foods anymore Try starting with very little amounts of regular food mixed with your diet food and see if that helps You may want to have the doctors check you for Gastroparesis Diabetics are more prone to get it but I just found out I have it and had it before I became type two diabetic It causes problems with the emptying of your stomach What new medications are you taking What is your age Are you depressed These are some questions that might help That should be with our heart Doctor no you have started a new diet and stayed with it keep up the good work This will take some timeStart

anyother problem  Ive heard that the testis can handle 110 lbscm squared Is that true To lose weight you have to have a differential of calorie out of total 3500 cals to lose one pound of weightcaloric input should be less than caloric output  Hi In weight loss the first thing you should do is answer Why I gained weight  Gaining weight has many areas and one of them is slow metabolism No matter how serious you are in diet or how motivated you are to exercise if your metabolism is not working it is all useless or perhaps you just need some Nutritionist that can help you I found this

call them The samething happens to me it could be GERD as far as nausea but i still havent figured out why the headaches ask your doctor about carpal tunnelmine get that way when I get tired and try to put weight on them also last night an alarm went off so i sat up in bed really fast and hurt my shoulder again the pain has been off and on for the day but for the most part i really dont feel anything  but did it anywaysWorkout on Monday came around my arm shoulder didnt hurt i was actually feeling good and strong lol Anyways i got through my first 10 reps at bench a measly 135lbs my shoulder started to burn thinking nothing of it i continued onto my second set another 10 lbs up at about 8 reps my shoulder actually started to hurt and burn sting all of those type of things On my 3rd set it was again 10 lbs higher got to about 6 before my shoulder wouldnt really take it anymore i know it wasnt the smartest thing to do but i guess i was in denyal that i messed up my shoulder prior to that So i pretty much couldnt work out the rest of the time I did some biceps workouts that didnt hurt my shoulder and some curls that didnt hurt it at all Next day i was told by my nco to go and talk to the medic Probably should have mentioned im currently in the US Army deployed to afganastan So a medic looks at my shoulder doesnt really know too much about it gets the SSG incharge of the aid station to look at it rotates it hears a verbal pop and feels grinding It was tender Day 3 it bearly hurt at all day 4 whenever now is doesnt really hurt at all It feels awkward at times but doesnt hurt i broke my profile they gave me by lifting a saw and other things but it doesnt really seem to hurt they are saying i could have partially torn the rotator cuff or labram but how could it not hurt if i tore something If it was torn wouldnt it take more time than a day or two Also there was a pressure sensitive spot under my shoulder by my armpit that hurt pretty bad to the touch but doesnt hurt anymore either could it just be tendonittis NO The blood sugar levels are set according to individual health conditions Therefore you should record your blood sugar and show to your doctor in order to set together your target blood glucose Well first of all Im impressed that at 14 youre trying to eat healthier Good for you My own experience with eating healthier is I make 1 or 2 small changes at a time and I replace whatever Im giving up with something I like thats healthier So for example I gave up chips for veggies with hummus popcorn Orville Red Simply Salted or nuts Try tracking your calories You can eat lots of fast food and not gain weight at your age Eat more calories each day until you begin to gain weight If that doesnt work see a doctor  Bland Diet While no specific diet is recommended for those diagnosed with HenochSchnlein purpura you can lessen gastrointestinal symptoms by adhering to a bland diet A bland diet can be as simple as refraining from eating any spicy foods to a more strict BRAT diet The BRAT diet consists of bananas rice applesauce and toast This combination is generally welltolerated by those with an upset stomach Liquids It is important to remain hydrated when suffering from HenochSchnlein purpura The condition normally clears up on its own over a period of weeks but during that time it is important to take in sufficient water sports drinks herbal teas and broth to remain hydrated Avoid milk soft drinks and caffeinated beverages which can increase dehydration Get checked for a TFCC tear That sounds like what I went through It all depends on how you lose weight Ive looked through many diet reviews  httpwwwpissedconsumercomconsumerreviewsdietstraininghtml and in many of them people complained having high blood pressure The thing is that sometimes quick and unhealthy weight loss can cause such consequences Nohard It could be a pinched nerve or possibly some connective tissue damage It is much more likely that the problem is related to your weightlifting injury than lung cancer If you are still lifting weights its probably a good idea to give it a rest and work on stretching and healing Weight Loss
