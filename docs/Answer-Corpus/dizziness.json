{"text": "You may have an impacted bowel You need to consult a health care professional right away From personal experience I would specifically ask the Dr to check her thyroid levels I had those symptoms for years with no explanation until my 20s when I was diagnosed with Hypothyroidism Another thing to consider is iron levels If she is starting puberty her levels could be all over the place causing her to be light headed ALSO one more thing does she drink any diet drinks Aspartame causes dizziness and lightheadedness for most of my family I would write those down to specifically ask the Dr to check them  Tell her to goto another doctor those are also symptoms of a heart attack Dont want to cause undue worry but I had those symptoms that was leading up to my heart attack Of course usual answer is take to the doctor but you could also try getting him to drink 8 oz of water Also to be on safe side get a blood pressure monitor if you are able to While ovulating your body can produce its own symptoms I would check with your doctor to see if this is a possibility Also be sure to take follow up pregnancy tests to ensure you are not pregnant as pregnancy can still occur with Plan B as well as bleeding similar to periods What you are describing is called orthostatic hypotension or postural hypotension A drop in your blood pressure occurs when you go from either lying or sitting to standing This type of low blood pressure hypotension usually lasts only a few seconds or minutes Orthostatic hypotension can make you feel dizzy or lightheaded and may even cause you to faint Mild orthostatic hypotension often doesnt need treatment Many people occasionally feel dizzy or lightheaded after standing and its usually not cause for concern The treatment for more severe cases of orthostatic hypotension depends on the cause Orthostatic hypotension can be caused by a variety of conditions including dehydration diabetes heart problems neurological diseases such as Parkinsons disease medications and longstanding high blood pressure in older adults If you have orthostatic hypotension caused by medications your doctor may change the dose or switch you to a different drug Other treatments include increasing fluids to treat dehydration or wearing elastic hose to increase the blood pressure in your legs See your doctor to determine whether your symptoms are related to an underlying condition that warrants treatment and if so what treatment is appropriate for you I had preeclampsia with my son All it took was a urine test for them to identify You swell up all over too with it and my face was very swolen when they induced my labor They check the amount of protein in your urine and if you have too much of it they run about two more urine tests where you pee in a bucket thing for 24 hours cause if it goes up so high you have to be induced for the danger it does you and the baby Mine wasnt allowing Sky to gain weight and he was already practicing breathing for labor at 34 weeks They induced me at 35 weeks and he was 4 lbs 2 oz when we left When I had preeclampsia I felt hot all over and dizzy Especially when I showered or stood for very long The point is though is that I was having the symptoms of preeclampsia for months before it came on full force symptoms like yours The best thing that you can do is rest and rest a lot Stress brings it on thats how mine came on so you just need to not worry about it because they check your urine and every time you have an appointment thats one of the things they check for As long as you dont have a high enough protein count in your urine you should be okay When I had Sky mine was so bad I couldnt see him until the next morning at I had him at 413 pm All you can do is take it easy Theyll let you know if you get into the danger zone thats one thing they check for every time you pee in the little cups they give you I really hope this settles your fears Stress brings it on so try and relax for now Im not a doctor or have any medical experiance but what you just described is what happend to me about 3 months ago Im 32 years old and have no history of them It sounds like he had a small petit mal seizure It can come out of nowhere even if there is no history of seizures sometimes its called an absence seizure As for the weight gain Im not sure at the moment I am still trying to figure it out I have gained 20 pounds since my injury I hope this helps a little bit  A nervous breakdown is typically caused by excess stress in the body In the field of mental health a nervous

would be a consistent symptom seen in anxiety disorders  Other symptoms displayed may include nausea shortness of breath fast heartbeat irritability and others  A nervous breakdown is typically caused by excess stress in the body In the field of mental health a nervous breakdown is classified as an anxiety disorder  Certainly dizziness is one of the possible symptoms that can result when a person feels anxious Experiencing dizzy spells along with a nervous breakdown would be a consistent symptom of an anxiety disorder Other symptoms displayed may include nausea shortness of breath fast heartbeat irritability and others Your experience could have been caused by literally dozens of conditions Some of the possibilities include I suggest that you start off by seeing your family doctor That person knows your medical history best and can begin a basic investigation by way of diagnostic testing Additionally the family doctor may refer you to other medical specialists including a cardiologist and neurologist Congratulations on making the decision to cease your alcohol consumption You are describing a condition called Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome Withdrawal side effects from alcohol in the body affects individuals differently Some will experience none to little in the way of side effects while others will have severe physiological and psychological symptoms Around the 4th or 5th day the symptoms of Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome tend to be at their highest level of intensity At this point in your individual detoxification from alcohol the acute physiological withdrawal symptoms should be under control Some of these symptoms may include sweating headache vomiting low grade fever blackouts intense thirst hallucinating seizures hand tremors racing heartbeats generalized anxiety and others Withdrawal from chronic abuse of alcohol over the course of years is serious business and can result in a medical emergency situation In situations such as your alcohol withdrawal medical supervision would have been the preferred method Your current uncomfortable physical and psychological symptoms should be investigated and not ignored Based upon your history of heavy alcohol usage I strongly recommend that you have a complete physical examination ASAPto assess your overall health It is possible that some long term neurological conditions and deleterious system changes or organ damage may have resulted from years of heavy alcohol dependence No matter what lingering negative symptoms that do remain youre still ahead of where you would have been without stopping Over the course of time the quality of your entire life should improve for the better I applaud your efforts at restoring normalcy into your life The challenge now is to remain abstinent from alcohol usage through life style changes and support systems that you put into placeYou just got off from a swaying 24 foot ladder at perhaps the 20th foot If you get back on the same ladder it will be at the same 20th foot After years of chronic alcohol dependence unfortunately we dont get the opportunity to start over again at the first rung of the ladder Best wishes for your continued success  I would discuss your symptoms with your parents and immediately contact the prescriber of your Wellbutrin medication order Wellbutrin can cause side effects such as being dizzy feeling light headed being uncoordinated high blood pressures which can explain your headaches head pain confusion and many more Please open the WebMd link below to see a complete listing of sideeffects associated with Wellbutrin httpwwwwebmdcomdrugs2drug76851wellbutrinxloraldetailslistsideeffects  The diagnosis process used by many doctors is called Differential Diagnosis Essentially a list of the top possible conditions is developed based upon case symptoms and testing results Onebyone these conditions are reduced to just one by the process of elimination I even approach most multiple choice test questions in this fashion I look for all of the incorrect answers until all that is left is the correct answer Based upon the basic information provided in your question I believe that the best choice for your fathers problems is related to his seizure disorder I have personally witnessed at least 100 seizures of varying types intensity and being had by different individuals The two details that you mentioned and swaying my determination to a seizure disorder were your dads obvious seizure history and the 15 minute time frame duration of the weakness dizziness and slurred speech Ministrokes TIAs for example usually last for only seconds to a few minutes seizures better fit the 15 minute duration of for the presenting symptoms The type of seizure that you have described in your question is called Petite Mal These types of seizures usually do not produce any obvious convulsive activity At first blush you may even think that the individual is just zoningout and not paying attention Now that a reasonable differential diagnosis has been developed lets answer your second question regarding whether or not medications are causing the seizures In and by them the answer is probably No Yes medication side effects and interactions can cause your dads symptoms But what is more likely is that the current medications are not adequately controlling the seizures Perhaps his previous medication regime of a year ago was the correct recipe My immediate thought would be to gradually restore the medication activity as it was prescribed a year ago It is a matter of trial and error until optimum dosage titration is achieved In summary 1 I am not a doctor and my answer represents just my best ideas and opinions based upon the data supplied with your question and my health care experience I do not know your fathers complete medical history have not seen testing results or medications being taken and cannot ask questions My answer cannot compare favorably to a hospital and their specialists million dollar types of diagnostic testing conducted and the conclusions of a neurologist With that disclaimer being presented my suggestive thoughts make some sense 2 I would respectfully recommend that you speak to the neurologist about the pros and cons of changing the medications back to what they were a year ago Best wishes for health improvement with your father Although sideeffects from Rituxan usually happen within 24 hours of its administration one of its possible sideeffects is dizziness This can be a serious condition and should be reported to your physician immediately Your blood sugar is too high but should not cause you to feel dizzy Please make certain that you are eating responsibly and taking your insulin as directed Many conditions can cause dizziness including ear disorders heart disease consuming alcoholand certain medications Because of the many possible reasons for your dizziness it is best to seek immediate medical attention Best wishes for a speedy resolution to your medical conditions  Yes the fluctuations do appear to be normal I do not think that your yawns dizziness feeling cranky or shaky presentation are related to blood sugar results being out of range Your reported blood glucose values appear to be very much in the normal range Here are some guidelines for blood sugar value ranges established by the American Medical Association as follows Upon waking up before breakfast 80 to 120 Before meals 80 to 120 2 hours after meals 160 or less At bedtime 100 to 140 PCAS or Polycystic Ovary Syndrome may be causing some of your uncomfortable symptoms such as mood swings andor depression This could be related to anxiety which causes different things for different people Since your symptoms seem to improve when youre not at work and youve only recently started having them after stopping the birth control and the cervical cancer tests I would suspect that anxiety could be the cause It could also ironically be a sideeffect from stopping or starting the birth control which can have physical side effects You can always visit a doctor if you are really worried or if the symptoms get worse but I dont think you have too much to worry about My first thought was low iron but if the blood tests have come back normal it could be something as simple as over use of asprin or tylenol As far ast the bruise goes if it was a deep bruise it could take a while to heal i have heard as long as a couple months if the tissue was damaged it would talk longer to heal Im not positive on this but I hope this helps  Hello I understand what you are going through My Grandmothers boyfriend has your problem I would advise seeing a Doctor first and if he wants you to get tests done then go to a hospital Good luck Hello Friend Generally it happen because of the low blood pressure and there a bunch of test that you prob need to take talk to your doctor and see what he wants you to get done \t\t\t\t\t\t For your any dental problem click here  confidentdentalcare First I want to say Go To The Doctor It will put your mind at ease if nothing else and reducing your stress is priority 1 There is some cramping associated with a healthy pregnancy though your uterus is stretching alot Its can be a bit uncomfortable So dont worry too much just tell the doctor what you wrote here and in the meanwhile Stay Calm Its the healthiest thing you can do in this situation Tunnel vision is a medical condition that results in a loss of peripheral vision As a result the patient can only see objects from within a circular field This condition has many possible causes including problems in the brain some eye diseases hallucinogenic drugs and certain extreme activities Blood loss to parts of the brain can lead to tunnel vision as can a tumor pressing against the optic never fibers A person who is exposed to air that has been contaminated by oils and hydraulic fluids such as may happen in an airplane and during hard exercise may also develop this condition Becoming ill while in an aircraft can cause temporary vision problems The pressure placed on the optic nerve causes the eye to lose retinal ganglion cells which can eventually cause the patient to go blind For some patients a loss of peripheral vision may be experienced prior to blindness I have not taken that specific drug but I have taken almost all of the drugs on the market Unfortunately it will depend on how your body is able to come down from that specific drug The worst withdrawel I ever had was Effexor the body discards the drugs in stages and it took months for the side effects to be gone Good Luck  As much as youll probably hate to hear this you really need to see a doctor Are you eating wellenough The symptoms you listed could be any number of things simple or serious You really need to see someone that can go through all the possibilities and can do some tests With a stroke we usually look for slurredgarbled speech onesided weakness or weakness in general but especially onesided confusion trouble walking numbness in the facearmleg again especially on one side confusiontrouble understanding people trouble seeing difficulty walking dizziness or a sudden severe headache It can but I definitely wouldnt say that just because you felt sick and dizzy after hitting your elbow you broke it I suggest you take your daughter to her pediatrician as a starting point Her symptoms should not be ignored If the symptoms seem to come and go with her menstrual cycle the problem could be anemia from blood loss Drinking extra water and eating ironrich foods red meat fortified grains might help the problem However many things could be causing these dizzy spells and its important you find out whats going on If theres an underlying illness or condition the sooner you can treat it the better Wishing you well I think you need to call your gynecologist or primary care provider for an appointment and some blood work A number of conditions could cause the symptoms you describe among them anemia or low red blood cell count Dehydration also could produce this type of symptom so be sure youre drinking enough water Youve suffered enough waiting for this to clear up on its own Now its time for some medical intervention I think I hope you feel better soon Unfortunately its impossible to say what could be causing these symptoms since several conditions could be the culprit You should not ignore these symptoms however You should take your daughter to her pediatrician as soon as possible Unexplained weight loss in an adolescent should never be ignored Youd do well to take her to the doctor and have some tests run to find out whats causing this and the dizziness All the best to you both So sorry to hear youre going through this How unpleasant Many conditions could cause the symptoms youre describing Anything from food poisoning to the flu could be at work here If you spike a fever over 101 degrees then its time to seek medical attention If you dont have a thermometer for taking your temperature I recommend you get one Its impossible to determine whether or not someone has a fever by simply feeling their forehead or judging by whether theyre sweating or things like that You really need to get a thermometer and measure your temperature accurately If youre not feverish then you probably can take a waitandsee attitude Drink plenty of fluids and dont try eating anything while youre actively vomiting or nauseated sick to your stomach If the symptoms continue to get worse if you get a fever or if you get sharp pains on the right side of your abdomen then it would be a good idea to see a health care provider I hope you feel better soon Im sorry to hear this Frequent is more than an annoyance It can cause you to fall and be injured Unfortunately the can only be determined with a physical exam and perhaps some additional testing Id recommend you make an appointment with your primary care provider PCP for an evaluation Meanwhile you can try drinking plenty of water to see if the dizziness is being caused by mild  Please do not drink large quantities of water all at once as this can cause other problems Just increase your daily water intake to make sure youre getting 810 glasses a day and see if that helps Also when you feel a dizzy spell coming on try to sit down immediately even if it means sitting right down on the floor or ground Its much better to sit down and perhaps look a bit silly than to fall and break a bone I wish you all the best Well this is an excellent question for your health care provider Id suggest you make an appointment as soon as possible with your primary care provider to discuss whats going on Many conditions can cause the symptoms youre describing To receive a diagnosis you need to be examined by someone who can provide ongoing care If you had testing done at an emergency room find out if your doctor can access the test results electronically by computer If not youll need to have the results sent to his or her office Unfortunately this isnt something that can diagnosed in a forum like this But I do wish you all the best in finding resolution to your problem How wonderful that you keep close tabs on your dad while hes in assisted living Its great he has someone to help advocate for his health needs It wouldnt hurt to get your dads dizziness symptoms checked out by a health care provider Its one of those things that could be related to his breakfast meal such as perhaps low blood sugar or it could be coincidental For instance dehydration can also cause the type of symptoms you describe and dehydration is very common in elderly people You might encourage your dad to drink plenty of water The main thing is this Since the symptoms are bothering him and no one wants to see him fall and break a bone or gash his head its probably a good idea to have a health care provider evaluate this All the best to you and your dad Im sorry your mom is going through this It sounds like a very uncomfortable situation If its been less than a week since your mom saw the doctor then you may just need to hang in there awhile longer The symptoms you describe could be caused by many conditions including a cold virus You may need to take a watchful waiting approach to see if the situation gets better or worse If it gets better then great If it gets worse Id suggest a return trip to the doctor Keep in mind Im just making suggestions I am not in a position to suggest a diagnosis or give medical advice Hope your mom feels better soon Im sorry youre going through this How awful Id suggest you make an appointment with a psychotherapist What youre describing sounds like  and it may take more than medication to address this issue may not even be the best medication for your situation Its true clonazepam is prescribed for anxiety attacks but its clearly not working There are other medications available Furthermore your situation may require a more wellrounded approach that includes cognitive talk therapy to address the issues that are triggering your panic attacks due to driving Please dont feel shy about seeking out psychotherapist Its often the case that just a few sessions can significantly improve conditions like yours that involve a single activity that causes panic Meanwhile take care while driving Youre doing the right thing by pulling over as needed If possible take public transportation or carpool with a coworker until your panic attacks subside I wish you all the best Im sorry youre going through this It sounds awful Are you positive you dont have  I mean has a medical professional told you you dont have diabetes or blood sugar problems Diabetes can develop slowly over time So if you have not had a checkup within the past year its possible you have diabetes and dont even know it Id suggest you see your primary health care provider soon for a routine physical examination The lab work will help tell if you have developed diabetes People who are overweight sedentary dont get a lot of exercise eat processed food or junk food and drink a lot of sugary sodas are at higher risk of developing diabetes Diabetes can lead to other health problems including blindness and foot ulcers These are more good reasons to go in for a checkup I wish you all the best Im sorry youre going through this I think the reason your care providers arent intervening is because your hemoglobin count is rising naturally It has progressed from 10 to 117 It may not be rising as quickly as youd like but its a good sign that the level is coming up on its own As you probably know hemoglobin is the protein on red blood cells that transports oxygen Im assuming youre referring to your hemoglobin number because thats the blood test that most closely fits the reference range of 13 to 18 youre referring to When hemoglobin levels are low we call it anemia Technically you are anemic You cant increase your blood volume but you can take steps to help the anemia clear up more quickly Eating ironrich foods and fruits that contain Vitamin C may help However you should check with your doctor first because excessive iron consumption can hinder the action of some medications Specifically green leafy vegetables like spinach should not be eaten if youre taking warfarin Coumadin Also you must not take iron supplements with antacids and treatment for ulcers frequently involves taking antacids In fact just to be clear Its good news that your hemoglobin numbers are coming up on their own Im sorry its taking longer than youd like and that youre having unpleasant symptoms Wishing you well Im as confused as you are I dont see how any health care provider can say a disease process doesnt exist if they havent done the appropriate testing However if your internal medicine doctor has done any blood work on you recently I would assume he or she did in fact test you for  since youd been previously diagnosed I think the key here is communication Id suggest you make another appointment with your internal medicine provider to discuss your concerns and confusion over the situation If your provider has blood test results he or she should be happy to share them with you If not you may ask again to be tested since youre symptomatic If you dont get satisfaction from this provider feel free to find another one Its important to have a primary care provider who listens to your concerns and takes time to explain the answers to your questions All the best to you Well this certainly deserves to be investigated by a medical professional I can think of a number of conditions that could cause the symptoms you describe Hypoglycemia possibly But also seizure and stroke So its important to get a true diagnosis and not rely on what he was told decades ago as a child Id suggest you start by calling your primary health care provider for an exam and blood work That will give you and your husband a good start Wishing you all the best Im sorry to hear youre going through this You should make an appointment for an examination Your balance problems could be caused by something as simple as fluid in the ear or you could be experiencing the early symptoms of something more serious such as Parkinsons disease I dont say that to frighten you only to prompt you to phone your primary care provider to get this checked out Assuming youre not exhibiting any  you probably do not need to head to the emergency room Just make an appointment with your doctor as soon as possible If the symptoms suddenly get worse or are accompanied by a high fever difficulty breathing or other serious symptoms then definitely seek immediate medical care Wishing you well Rather than a doctor Id recommend you try a dentist While emergency rooms generally will treat a dental problem most doctors defer to dentists for all things toothrelated And your issues sound toothrelated If there is an infection developing your dentist either will treat it or will refer you for medical treatment Its possible for a dental infection to cause ear pain facial swelling and the other symptoms you describe Sooff to the emergency dental center for you Or call your regular dentist explain the situation and try to get in today If they cant see you ask them to recommend an alternative provider Dental infections are nothing to mess around with Feel better soon These are serious symptoms that deserve to be investigated immediately While many conditions could cause the symptoms you describe a major condition with these symptoms is  And stroke ideally should be treated within 3 hours of the onset of symptoms Even if the symptoms have resolved by now I urge you to seek medical treatment At the very least call the individuals primary health care provider to report what has happened The provider may give you further instructions I wish you both all the best My concern is for your immediate safety Severe dizziness and balance problems can cause you to fall and injure yourself You need to make sure you have someone with you at all times to help you get around Using an assistive device such as a walker is not enough Also you need to call your doctor as soon as possible to report these symptoms andor find out the results of the scan you just had done You typed November 2012 If that is correct then you should be getting the results soon If thats a typo and you meant 2011 then you need to seek immediate medical attention for these new symptoms Do not delay in getting these symptoms checked out I wish you all the best Interestingly yes the two things could be related And you should get this checked out by a doctor as soon as you can Under certain circumstances its possible for the uninjured eye to react to an injury to the opposite eye This is a condition that needs to be treated because it can get worse Usually though this sort of situation occurs when theres a fairly serious injury to the opposite eyeball itself Thus the symptoms youre experiencing in the right eye could indicate a more serious injury than you thought to the left eye While this isnt an emergency Id recommend you see a doctor at your earliest convenience to find out whats going on No sense taking chances with your vision Best to you I am not a doctor just an informed medical consumer I would have someone take you to the emergency room Your symptoms are suspcious of bleeding in the digestive tract perhaps significant since you are lightheaded If you are reluctant to do that at least call your doctor If hes not available I strongly suggest having someone take you to the emergency room Congrats on the decision to quit alcohol use The thought of experiencing painful withdrawal symptoms is what prevents millions of individuals from seeking alcohol detox The truth is that the severity of your symptoms will depend on how much alcohol you have been consuming the frequency with which you have been drinking and how long youve been doing it During your alcohol use chemical toxins have been collecting in your system Detox is the process of flushing those chemical toxins from your body Your central nervous system has grown accustomed to your alcohol intake so when you stop drinking your body may begin to crave something it is used to getting that you are no longer giving it This is exactly what withdrawal symptoms are and they may present in a number of different ways Alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be both physical and psychological Physical symptoms usually include  Insomnia  Sweating  Headache  Nausea and vomiting  Increased heart rate  Loss of consciousness  Tremors  Seizures Psychological symptoms may also include  Fatigue  Anxiety  Irritability  Depression Symptoms may begin within a few hours after the last time alcohol was consumed and may last up to 48 to 72 hours It is important to note that psychological withdrawal may continue long after the physical symptoms subside Many AA members in recovery report having psychological cravings years after they stopped drinking Another complaint that some people experience during detox that is more serious is the occurrence of DTs or delirium tremens The DTs usually emerge within three to five days after you quit consumption and are periods of confusion disorientation and hallucinations Delirium tremens can also be physical such as the shakes and sweating and if left untreated they can be fatal IV therapy medical detox is seen as one of the best methods for alcohol detox as it works to reduce the amount of withdrawal symptoms experienced by the individual IV therapy medical detox should be administered under the supervision of a physician and is relevant because it allows the physician to make any necessary changes to the medication protocol as the withdrawal symptoms change which keep the patient comfortable Gallus Detox Center is a private alcohol detox facility which specializes in IV therapy medical detox For questions about our facility or method for detox you can call us at 8553386929 Hi get doctor to check if you have a perforated ear drum as this might be a possibility If u have had a paniac attack in the past AVOID caffeine at all costs I have always had anxiety 247 I dont drink soda or Starbucks but I had a frap at Starbucks one day and that set me over the edge I had to leave class and go right to the school psychiatrist Now I try to get decaf or ask them to halve the caff Bc espresso is crazy high in caf Esp if ur not use to it Allergic reactions to mold typically cause symptoms such as sneezing itchywatery eyes runny nose nasal congestion or respiratory problems This is because allergies trigger specific allergic cells to release chemicals that cause these symptoms There is not a well understood mechanism by which mold allergy could contribute to neurocognitive symptoms Because of this I often recommend that patients pursue other investigation beside allergy so they dont miss another cause of these symptoms If you are concerned that mold is causing symptoms you could always try techniques to decrease the mold level in your basement such as dehumidifier EFFECTS THE SHOT DOES PEOPLE DIFFERENTLEY I SPOTTED WHEN I GOT MMINE I have a fainting order aswell because of low blood pressure and I take medications to regulate it It took a very long time with doctors and several tests also had a heart monitor lungheart ultrasound etc All came out fine If theres any possibility that low blood pressure is the reasoning for your dizziness I have a few suggestions I have found that staying hydrated and I mean drinking 4 Liters a day eating a healthy diet with plenty of salt Ive been told by doctors to salt my ceral in the mornings have helped a great deal Ive also noticed that stress makes it worse along with lack of sleep and inactivity makes me much more dizzy so having at least an hour before bed time to fully relax whither it be reading drinking tea having a bath or listening to ambient music helps so that I can have energy to go for a hike run or workout the next day Exercise has helped more than I could have imagined When I was unsure about why I was fainting so often multiple times an hour sometimes multiple times a minute it scared me as Im sure it is scaring you I stopped going for runs working out and even walking or biking to school because I was afraid of getting dizzy and passing out on route This only made things worse and soon I was so dizzy I couldnt get out of bed I highly suggested asking your doctor if your blood pressure is related its is such a simple factor that can easily be over looked along with making sure that exercising wont put you at risk I truly help this helps you in some way even if blood pressure isnt the problem Hello there I would suggest taking a pregnancy test I know that you can have a light pink display if you are pregnant and dizziness However it could be that you are just late Im very regular too However things can effect your period such as stress or if you live with another female or have a close friend your cycles will shift closer to theirs mostly by a week Are you trying to get pregnant Just curious Let us know how it turns out It is perfectly reasonable that she conceived and you are the father based on the timing you described It was 9 days following the 26th that she found out she is pregnant Women typically ovulate 1015 days after they started their last period and pregnancy tests can detect the pregnancy 5 days from the day she was supposed to start her period Therefore timing was likely just right and she was a few days out from starting her period This is most likely a problem within your digestive system either your colon small intestine and all areas that digest your food after it passes through your stomach This is quite dangerous as your food is not being properly digested at all and should be treated by a physican You can start with your PCP but it sounds as if you need to see a gastroenterologist this is an MD that specialize in problems with the stomach and the digestive system I have seen an ENT many times Never find anything Hey there Well the reason that you feel dizzy may be because of the amount of sugar in your blood Just remember that too much of it can cause diabetes That is when your body cant take in sugar so it is used as extra body fat That can lead to obesity and in severe cases it can lead to death So it is a good idea to see your doctor and tell himher that you have dizziness when walking And heshe should give you medication It sounds like it could be an allergic reaction to the bleach I recommend getting it checked out Sometimes getting a second doctors or even thirds opinion is great I had a health issue and I went to multiple doctors before any of them figured it out You know your body best and you know when something needs to be figured out Except for the fever it sounds like my daughter When she was 10 she got a bad virus she did have a fever at that point and never got better We went to Mayo Clinic after 2 years of being sick and undiagnosed we went to every specialist that exists She has POTS She is still chronically ill but can now function enough to go to school The doctors initially diagnosed me with Undefined Vertiginous or Labyrinthine syndrome but i dont feel the world moving or me rotating Slowly in about a week my BP came down to 13080 and has been normal since Since then my condition became better and these complaints reduced But since then twice my pulse rate suddenly shot up with the same throbbing feeling in the head I had my menopause 4 years back Also I was on steamed vegetablesraw foods diet in March Also I never used to burp but now I do quite frequently and acid also comes up with itAlso after switching to normal food for about 20 days my diaphragm kept fluttering The doctors said that there is nothing wrong with me medically But even after such a long time this is still not going What could possibly be wrong I would highly recommend heading to the ER and having it checked out Sometimes it could be an episode of severe heartburn or it could be something else  especially since you have pains in your chest Maybe HeShes Had The Tummy Flu AbsolutelyI take meds for RA which raise my BP along with BP meds which make it important to check my BP daily If it gets too high I contact my doctor to discuss other options including different types of excersise Furthermore I also check my pulse rate at the same time to be sure it does not go too high Maybe because your weak and or you dont eat enough everyday eat protein to help dizziness and also drink more that eight ounces of water every day I was switched once from Paxil to Celexa Previously I had also just discontinued Paxil because I got pregnant My side effects of discontiuing Paxil were flulike weakness dizziness just plain felt horrible Dizziness is extremely common in PD and is a result of the condition itself PD medications and other medications What typically happens is a patient has a long history of Hypertension  or high blood pressure BP  and has been treated appropriately for many years before developing PD The PD lowers BP a little Then he is started on levodopa or a dopamine agonist or other PD drugs and his BP drops further In addition many men have difficulty with bladder control and begin to restrict their water intake This creates a perfect storm forfainting  Treatment requires reducing the longtime hypertensive drugs increasingfluid intake by at least 2 glasses of water per day and if not enough adding salt and medications to raiseBP  I am not a doctor but wanted to respond to the nutritional aspects Some of the symptoms you list such as frequent urination are symtpoms of type 1 diabetes Im not saying you have it but it is worth being checked out As for the dizzy feelings after sugar its hard to say I would aim to eat balanced meals with a protein healthy fat whole grains and fruits and vegetables If you eat sugar do so after a balanced meal or snack Eating sugary foods on an empty stomach may contribute to the dizzy feelings The best possible thing to do is get a physical that includes lab work to make sure everything is okay In the meantime focus on taking care of yourself by eating well and getting sleep Hi Dizziness can be caused by a number of serious conditions These can include a stroke a heart attack breathing problems or trouble with blood sugar A bluish tint to the skin is also a worry It can mean that a person is not getting enough oxygen Someone with these symptoms should call 911 right away Hi Your blood pressure rises with each heartbeat and falls when your heart relaxes between beats While BP can change from minute to minute with changes in posture exercise stress or sleep it should normally be less than 12080 mm Hg less than 120 systolic AND less than 80 diastolic for an adult age 20 or over Good Luck Hi It just sounds like you have been burning the candle at both ends and they have met hence burn out look take a couple of days off relax with lots of sleep eat well keep of any alcohol drink

reductions in mental abilities These changes particularly those affecting memory can last for up to a week and possibly longer in regular users The fact that MDMA markedly impairs information processing emphasizes the potential dangers of performing complex or skilled activities such as driving a car while under the influence of this drug Over the course of a week following moderate use of the drug many MDMA users report feeling a range of emotions including anxiety restlessness irritability and sadness that in some individuals can be as severe as true clinical depression Similarly elevated anxiety impulsiveness and aggression as well as sleep disturbances lack of appetite and reduced interest in and pleasure from sex have been observed in regular MDMA users Some of these

the day before my workout and I pushed myelf too hard If you are overexherting yourself then it could be that you have low blood sugar and it is causing your dizziness and making you feel light headed If you are not eating enough during the day before a strenusous workout this could be a side effect I would try to eat a healthy meal that contains a good balance of proteincarbsnutrients try something like a chicken breast and a small sweet potato and maybe a small dinner roll Give your food some time to settle an hour or two then during your workout try to sip on a gatorade or Vitamin water Try not to over do it when you work out sometimes people push themselves too hard and it can results in injury as well If you are still experiencing those symptoms after trying this then I would see your doctor to make sure its not something more serious Allergic asthma is often marked by symptoms like difficulty drawing breath wheezing and coughing and can be trigged by different factors in the environment such as dust mold or animals in your case bleach Asthma is part of a battle that takes place as the immune system marshals its forces to fight off an invading organismor what mimics such invaders This fight significantly affects the human airway and lungs generating an often violent and potentially deadly reaction  asthma Try drink freshly made lemon juice with a bit of ginger in it this will boost immunity and improve the funtion of the respiratory system Also drink thyme tea and mint tea with fresh lemon in the evenings this will clear the airways of thick sputum mucus in the bronchitis and prevent an inflammation of the lungs airways also try smell some fresh garlic if you get dizzy or light headed  sqweeze a clove of garlic near the nose  this will give a quick boost to the nerve system Natural Respiratory Treatment  Asthma Herbal Remedies People will frequently relate onset of symptoms to certain life events surgery car accident etc It is not clear if there is cause and effect but we know that stress can affect the immune system There is also some work to suggest that MS patients may have exacerbations more frequently when under stress than not So call your neurologist and discuss what is happening Indeed heat and humidity can be the duo that makes you dizzy Being well hydrated is important but youre forgetting about all of that sweat youve created Youre losing valuable electrolytes In the future Id make sure to have one of the sports drinks on hand that has sodium and potassium mix in it You can buy as powders to add to water or in bottles There are lots of options out there Often i just fill up my water bottle with 12 water and 12 electrolyte mix The simple rule is that when summer comes around dont forget your electrolytes Clearly if youve taken precautions and you still end up with problems you need to seek medical attention From my own experience it could be an ear infection a new medicine you may be taking or fatigue You should go see your doc Hi I am as well hypoglycemic but not diabetic Have you been diagnosed as diabetic I to in the mornings crave sugar because my sugar gets so low while sleeping Sugary protects not the healthiest but there are several healthy foods that could make you feel better Fiber bars protein bars There healthy but will give you the energy you need If possible avoid TVVideo Games everyday or play by taking break within specific time interval If you play video games everyday continuously then definitely they affects on your eyes health My heart goes out to you and I certainly hope you have already discovered the problem Im replying for the sake of others who may read this and wonder People tend to assume that if you have always had the symptoms then you have Celiac and if the symptoms appear after some time you dont have Celiac This seems logical but the trouble is that Celiac can be asymptomatic or it can remain asymptomatic for a time before becoming symptomatic In other words you can have the condition for a time or forever without having any notable symptoms My daughter began to flatulate quite severely at about age 11 Unbeknownst to us this was actually an uncommon symptom At age 13 she was diagnosed with both type one diabetes and Celiac Unless she had presented with t1d we would never have guessed to test her for Celiac The truth is that many people who are Celiac were not diagnosed immediately and suffered silently for years before any pain or symptoms of poor digestion presented My daughter began a glutenfree diet and her flatulence disappeared as oddly and quickly as it appeared Nearly six months later after her intestines had healed she accidentally ingested gluten at a restaurant Severe abdominal cramps came upon her though she had never experienced strong symptoms if any prior to that day I suppose her body gave out a louder scream once it knew how healthy felt No you dont have to have the symptoms all your life for you to still have Celiac Go to back to the physician be persistant You might also consider getting a second opinion too Oftentimes it simply takes awhile to find out what the underlying cause is I noticed that you didnt mention a biopsy out of all the tests you have had A biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing Celiac It may give an answer to something that has remained hidden too I am not saying that Celiac what you have but if you have exhausted other options you may want to opt for a biopsy during which time a tiny piece of your intestines is taken and scrutinized Also has the doctor considered issues with your inner ears When I had nausea and vertigo it turned out the be an inner ear issue called BPPV It would certainly seem as if the symptoms you have are all connected but it is possible that the dizziness is only mildly connected to the abdominal pain or even that they are different issues Wishing you relief Sharon Yes you could have a sinus infection Symptoms can vary from person to person but some of the symptoms that you mentioned in your question are often seen in sinus infection Many sinus infections are viral and will be selflimiting in a weeks or so but some can be bacterial and require medical intervention like antibiotics In order for you to be properly diagnosed and treated you will need to see a health care professional for a examination first An ear infection will not cause your throat to be red but it can cause lymph nodes to swell An irritated throat can cause lymph nodes to swell The commonality of both ear pain and a red throat at the same time could be a virus or bacteria Since your doctor may not know this answer even after an exam many will just put you on an antibiotic Some will rely on the results of a Strep screen to make that determination Your dizziness may be related to your ear pressureinfection Even though the CT scan was normal if you are continuing to have this troublesome array of symptoms you need to be seen by a neurologist for a higherlevel diagnostic evaluation Anytime that you have sex with a woman and CHOSE not to use a condom even if she is on another form of birth controlYOU ARE RESPONSIBLE or at least half responsible since your partner has a say about this too Rather than worry if you are the father or someone else it would be best to recognize the seriousness of this event If your partner is pregnant and it could be you then you need to step up to the plate and support her If your partner does have other partners it can get a bit messy but you cannot really determine if you are the father based solely on a pregnancy test Pregnancy tests are not foolproof so the test can be wrong Partners have been know to lie about the positive results to test your response a very bad practice and sometimes early pregnancies end in miscarriages Be a man In the event that you have created a pregnancy then your life is about to change Dont throw accusatory arrows and forget about the big picture You may be holding a baby that looks surprisingly like you in less than a yearor not Go with her to the doctor for a confirmation test and exam If she is pregnant then eventually you will be able to get an estimate of the date of conceptionbut perhaps not now If it is disclosed in the near future that you are not the father then at least you will be able to hold your head up high and be proud of your personal support during the very trying time See an ENTthat would be your next step Some tonsil remnants can regenerate over time if all tissue was not removed when you were two especially when you are sick now tonsils are really lymph tissue There are plenty of best hospitals I found this to be a reasonable source httphealthusnewscombesthospitals They are listed by specialty including ENT Yes that can happen It happened to me If the prescription or prism assuming you have one in your glasses is incorrect even in one lens this can cause dizziness If the glasses are progressive lens bifocals or trifocals this can also cause visual disturbances that are interpreted by your brain as dizziness There can be hundreds of different causes of dizziness but your first step is to take your glasses back to check your prescription and fitting If everything is perfect then you will need to see your medical provider so other causes of dizziness can be investigated Your blood pressure is not in control as you know Taking your blood pressure readings every day at least twice would provider your doctor with helpful information since it appears that you will need an adjustment in your medication regime Adjusting medications is very common so this is done in most people In addition to taking your blood pressures at home make sure to reduce your salt intake and if you are overweight try to reduce your weight By achieving an ideal weight and walking more exercise this will greatly improve the effectiveness of your blood pressure management Assuming you are talking about a MIDDLE ear infection you should have experienced relief in three daysIF a you were properly and accurately diagnosed b your ear infection was due to a bacteria and not a virus and c the antibiotic you are taking was the proper choice and dosage Failure to respond to your treatment is a reason to call your medical provider for patientspecific advice Since you are still having dizziness and head pressure it would be wise to be reexamined Plenty of ideas hundreds in fact but an idea is not an accurate diagnosis A diagnosis or treatment can not be accomplished blindly over the Internet You will need to see a medical provider  someone who can take a good medical history examine you firsthand order any diagnostic tests and thenprovider a treatment plan for you Absolutelystart with the family doctor This could be a simple easilyidentified problem like an anal fissure or hemorrhoid causes bright red blood or blood streaking on the toilet tissue but one needs to rule out polyps and other causes The doctor may recommend seeing a gastroenterologist for a further workup Make sure he gets care Men are notorious for being very stubborn about medical visitsespecially those that may involve areas where the sun does not shine if you know what I mean There is really not much that I can blindly do in the way of diagnosis or treatment from this end of the Internet so it is time for you to see a good ENT specialist Ask your doctor for a referral so you can have a higherlevel evaluation I have no idea since I do not know anything about you your medical history nor do I have a way of checking your blood electrolytes Bananas are rich in potassium and other essential nutrients so perhaps you are lacking those Until you find out for surejust eat the bananas It is time to see a subspecialist a otoneurologist  an ENT that specializes in inner ear disorders and have a new workup There are numerous types of vertigo so it would be good to have a new evaluation Things may have changed since you were ten Unfortunately there are not very many things that can be done but there are more treatments and medications out there depending the TYPE of vertigo that you have See your medical provider right away Tachycardia rapid heart rate can be a sign of many different types of cardiac rhythm disorders so you may need to see a cardiologist for a full diagnostic workup Two weeks is a bit long to feel sick without an explanation so it may be wise to consult your medical provider  someone who knows your medical history someone who can examine you and someone who has the ability to order additional diagnostic lab tests It would not be possible to determine a specific reason for your dizziness and numb lips blindly over the Internet unfortunately since there can be numerous possibilities You have two issues not likely related Based on your list of symptoms you probably are biologically ill  perhaps a viral or bacterial infection You will need to see your medical provider so that you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated If you ear is this painful a middle ear infection would be a distinct possibility Your other issue equally as important is your cutting Wrist cutting is a symptom of a deep psychological problem You may not be able to handle some pain in your life and you are using this cutting as an outlet You need some help but you will need to ask for it I hope that you do If you are a teenage please inform your parents If you are an adult please seek some medical care A primary care provider may be able to help you with both your ear pain and your cutting Both a sinus infection and a middle ear infection can cause dizziness While antibiotics do not typically cause dizziness you may find it listed among the lesscommon side effects Augmentin typically causes an upset stomach or diarrhea but not dizziness Keep in mind that there can be hundreds of other causes of dizziness so if your symptoms persist you will need to consult your medical provider The ER doctor may be correct since inner ear disorders are really high on the diagnostic possibilities Most care cause by viruses that are selflimiting so if you can hang in there another week or so it may resolve If not your doctor should send ot you an ENT specialist  one that specializes in inner ear problems neurotologist for a higherlevel diagnostic workup This may include an MRI and a variety of inner ear diagnostic tests You have an anxiety disorder so you will likely worry no matter what I tell you Unfortunately it would be impossible to determine the true nature of your recent event based solely on the information in your posting so you will need to wait until you see your doctor  someone who knows your medical history and can examine you If your doctor or cardiologist feels it is clinically important they can order an event monitor where you can record any future episodes as an ECG for later review I cant tell you exactly since I have no way of examining you but I can say that when you sit or are nearly immersed in very hot water the blood tends to pool in those areas that are under the water Subsequently when you stand blood may rush to the areas of heat and warmth and be shunted from the brain and cause you to be dizzy or even faint Remember to drink fluids get up and move very slowly and purposefully You need to be carefully reexamined by an ENT specialist While labyrinthitis still can be causing some of these residual symptoms there are many other ear conditions that can mimic it No nasal polyps are inflammatory growths often related to allergies I have never heard that they can cause vertigo This was most likely an incidental findings since you apparently were not having any problems Allergies can be related to vertigo in some cases but so can a hundred other things I am pleased that you are getting a good diagnostic workup since vertigo is can be very difficult to evaluate You told me your age but how about the age of your girlfriend Under age 18 in most states most likely Texas as well unless the visit was is for birth control STDs or pregnancy she can only get medical treatment with her parents permission There is really nothing officially you can do even if you are 18 You both can talk to her parents and ask for help Sometimes you can disclose this information to a counselor at school or a pastor if she attends church They can often intervene on her behalf to try and talk to the parents Okay so seven years ago I experienced a bleed I learned several things 1 the most common symptoms of a stroke dont necessarily show up I my case I had chugged Mountain Dew and followed it with a Red Bull chaser Then I was exercising I never felt dizzy didnt have any ringing in my ears didnt even feel tired When I stopped exercising my right side skin was not feeling anything I had no tingling no loss of controlled motion no loss of vision didnt feel hot or cold just couldnt feel the skin on my right side This confused me and so stupidly I drove home to put my bike away and my laptop in the house I was lucky nothing more happened on the way home I went to the hospital and they did an MRI My blood pressure was high but not extremely high it had probably dropped by then 2 my doctor a neurologist told me that he couldnt see a cause for the strokebleed When I relayed to him that I drank Mountain Dew and Red Bull he told me that there have been teenagers and college students who have suffered both death and bleeds after exercising after the same drinks 3 You are not safe to drive for at least a year after a bleed or stroke as your brain will attempt to reset your nerves During one such brain reset I was talking to a friend who was sitting next to me at the start of the conversation I went into a brain reset mid sentence and was gone for 10 minutes When I came out of it I finished the sentence and was surprised to see my friend standing in the kitchen talking to 911 I had neglected to warn him about the brain reset 4 Clot and bleed strokes are different With the current medications a clot can be treatedhelped with immediate medications A bleed however cant really be treated as the only treatment is to give clotting medication which would cause a clot stroke Bleed strokes vary in degrees mine was medium Blood is not good on nerves and can cause many side effects 5 I also learned that we are all wired differently My bleed was right above my medulla oblongata the part of the brain that performs the autonomic functions The neurologist did not believe based on where my bleed was that I should be in any condition but comatose 6 The heeling process is variable The neurologist told me that he had a patient who had 10 times my bleed area and he was completely recovered within two weeks He had another one that had a bleed 110th the size of mine and has been right side crippled for 30 years Another patient was crippled for 15 years and woke up one morning with all the symptoms gone I was hopeful 7 Where Im at now I can tell I lost some of my learning capacity but Im working on that The feeling has partially returned on the right side but my right leg is in constant pain the pain you feel when a limb goes numb and is coming back to life No pain meds fix stop it Ive lost my ability to tell when Im hungry to tell when Im full and to remember what a food tastes like I can remember if I liked it or not On the bright side good food tastes really good every time and I can eat my favorite foods all week long without getting bored However I have to be very portion controlled or Ill turn into a pumpkin In addition I have to eat at the same time during the day or I forget to eat 8 My advice If you have numbness in any part of your body and it persists after movement assume its a stroke or a bleed and seek help Restrict your driving after having a stroke or better yet dont drive at all 9 My advice to friends and family Let your strokedbleed person do everything that they can do because it really is true if you dont use you can lose it So a few broken plates wont matter in the end but a persons spirit can be crushed by over protectiveness Hi to both of you and I too am concerned about my wife Debra who is Type 2 seven rods in her back Dvt in her legs going thorough menopause has alllergies and she has all things that you have been experiencing You have to look at everything I tell my wife Debra to invesigate everything and find out what works for her and her Doctor said too that everything was fine I told her to research her Metformin and she decreased it by 1000mg a day Guess what she has never felt better all because she has been losing weight Everybody needs to adjust things in this life We also need to look at other things and it may be or not the problem like weather flu colds nurtition Try theses Immune Boasting Foods Elderberry Button Mushrooms Acai berryOystersWatermelonCabbageAlmondsGrapefruitWheat germLow Fat YogurtGarlicSpinachGreenBlack Tea Sweet Potato and Broccoli and my favorite beets My Wife just said it could be stress and or associated the nerves so the BVitimins would be area to start I have to go Bye Steve  Debra Ive cut my metformin to a 5oo mg in the morning and 500 mg at night I feel so much better I felt over medicated with 2000 mg a day Ive lost some weight so when you lose weight you need to have your metformin lowered I woke up a couple days ago and my blood sugar was 65 I thought I was going to die It scared me horribly I keep orange juice in the frig just in case My dizziness has gotten better since my metformin was lowered I was diagnosed with diabetes 5 months ago so Im new at this Im learning how to eat right Diabetes is to be take seriously if you dont take care of yourself you can go down hill fast I feel better when I get out and walk My name is Debra See another doctor anxiety is not fun xanax would help keep your mind from being over active and help you sleep calm you down See a psychiatrist thats what I did my parents in denial also They think seeing a shrink means your crazy but all it is is a chemical imbalance in the brain sambalukyahoocom I can see where you are coming from it does seem kind of early to tell However in this day and age  ya never know The way I understand home pregnancy tests they react to a hormone present in her urine When I was testing for pregnancy with my children the chemical reaction worked VERY QUICKLY The times I have tested and the results were negative it seemed to take forever It does not necessarily take a month to make those hormones strong enough to show as positive just as it does not take a month to become pregnant Since this relationship must have just started as you seem to be saying that you have never had sex before this with each other and cant possibly be responsible for this pregnancy unless it happened on one of these dates then you will have to trust your new found lover and wait it out with her She is probably terrified Be supportive There are now noninvasive tests so you can both be sure of paternity later She could probably use a good friend right now and youll get more answers by showing kindness during this complicated time rather than slinging around phrases like it aint mine Good Luck You should probably go to your primary care physician to get a blood test for pregnancy yes go to the doctors as soon as possible better safe then sorry I suffer from anxietypanic for 30 years now Caffeine will definitely affect you depending on how much you use For me exercise helped but at the same time it did make my heart race and sometimes I talked myself into a full blown attack If you are healthy chalk it up to worrying or anticipating an attack May be inner ear vertigo See your doctor It depends on your physical condition weight age and diseases The dizziness its probably due to the high pulse rate Sometimes during the night I have found my BP at 9358

doctors moved his hand to and that was extremely difficult I was diagnosed with a concussion Now you may have one too I suggest getting checked out by a doctor but that is just my experience with a concussion herpes and swelling are not synonimous Herpes is more like a rash swelling  in my case when it occurs  goes away with topical dermatological cream like for example  Mupicorin ointment Bumps and pimples ARE NOT HERPES Herpes is usually a much more severe thing It can be very serious and gastroenteritis lasting more than a week really should be assessed by a physician Most food poisoning
