{"text": "I went through the same thing and my doctor waited a year to Insure I was completely clear and gave me the shot I have not had any probs but that was in 2011 he says I will not be struck again The shingles vaccine is routinely recommended for adults older than 60 years of age The vaccine is given as a single dose and is only given once The shingles vaccine is recommended even if you have had a previous episode of shingles as long as the disease is not active The shingles vaccine does not treat shingles it prevents shingles In studies of adults over the age of 60 the shingles vaccine reduced attacks in half decreased how long the attacks lasted and prevented long term nerve pain postherpetic neuralgia in the majority of patients The same virus that causes chickenpox causes shingles Once you have had chickenpox the virus remains dormant in your nerves Aging chronic diseases and certain medications lower the bodys immune system reactivating the virus and causing shingles No serious problems have been identified with the shingles vaccine The vaccine is made using a live but harmless virus Shingles can be a devastating illness so talk to your doctor about getting the shingles vaccine Although advice may vary generally cold water or cold compresses are best for shingles Hot water may make shingle blisters worse Heat increases blood flow and may cause further inflammation and swelling Taking a cool bath or using cool wet compresses on your blisters may help relieve the itching and pain Ice can also provide relief for pain and itching However it is important not to apply the ice directly on the skin or it may stick It is also important not to leave the ice on for too long because it can cause frostbite Always talk with your doctor about the best treatment for your shingles Gabapentin works to relieve pain by altering the way your body senses pain You should notice that your pain from shingles starts to improve over one to two weeks after starting gabapentin but it may take longer in some people However some people feel the benefit straight away Gabapentin is a medication that needs to be gradually increased The usual recommendation for pain from shingles is day 1 one 300 mg pill day 2 one 300 mg pill twice daily day 3 one 300 mg pill three times a day and thereafter working up to 600 mg three times a day Doses above 1800 mg a day have not been shown to have greater benefit Because everyones tolerance to medications varies be sure to discuss your use of gabapentin with your doctor You should not get the shingles vaccine if you are having a definite outbreak of shingles The decision to get vaccinated should be made with your doctor and be based on your specific circumstances Generally a person should make sure the shingles rash has disappeared before getting vaccinated How often people who have had shingles get another attack is not entirely clear Some studies suggest that the risk of a recurrent attack of shingles is rare However a Minnesota study found that 56 of patients suffered another shingles attack in an 8 year period Talk with your doctor about the shingles vaccine Since the down side of the shingles vaccine is low the general recommendation is to get the shingles vaccine to help prevent another attack Remember that no vaccine is a 100 effective but shingles is extremely painful and for adults 60 and older the shingles vaccine is recommended regardless of whether you have had a prior shingles attack Yes It felt like I had a sunburn on my scalp when I brushed by hair All on one side of my head Shingles is usually a result of having chicken pox during childhood It can come at any age any time and should be addressed as quickly as possible YES MY AUNT HAD THEM MORE THEN ONE TIME  I havent seen any studies absolutely confirming a link between essential tremors and shingles But there are plenty of web type anecdotal accountings of their common development in some individuals for me to see a connection It was interesting to see that the drug Pregablin  As described in an article on BioPorfolio was approved by FDA to treat nerve pain as sometimes seen with essential tremor conditions It was also approved to treat nerve pain associated with diabetes and shingles Gabapentin Neurontin based upon my personal experience is an effective medication to treat neuropathy It is also used to treat seizures restless leg syndrome and other neurological conditions Hopefully Gabpentin will be titrated for you to an effective dosage level where your neuralgia will be under control Gabapentin comes in capsules and pills up to 800 mg During clinical trials Gabapentin showed effectiveness with daily level between 1800 mg and 3600 mg Your prescribed dosage will be individualized according to height weight sex age and your medical condition Yes you can I just got out of the Hospital with it and it was in half of my scalp The scalp hurts worse because any rubbing of any hairs attached to the sore will cause intense pain Once you get the virus youll always have it It will come an go depending on your immune system About 8 days since first symptoms and now it is keeping me awake still no rash at all but I constantly look because of the itching and burning I was 21 when i got shinglesi took my son to a well baby appt when he was 2 months I was exposed to 2 brothers that came in for chicken pox We were in different waiting areas and never came in contact with them My rash was behind my left ear I had a lot of health issues with my delivery so the only places i went were to drs appts so i believe you only have to breath the air atleast thats all i didlol I had shingles that started in my scalp went across my temple  into my eye I got to my doctor soon enough 48 hours to get an injection and prescription which prevented it from blinding me I am a 55 yo woman who has been plagued by shingle outbreaks since my childhood chickenpox outbreakSame virus herpes Zoster as you probably know I also have daily pain AND itch at the same spot  I saw a great neurologist at a major Boston hospital who \tyes its rare but it happens Search Internal Shingles on Google Or heres a link httpwwwlivestrongcomarticle27808signssymptomsinternalshingles Yes they do The skin itches some before the rash shows up and during the rash and also when the scabs are present Your infant is at risk of getting chickenpox from your shingles outbreak Chickenpox can be an extremely serious illness in a twomonthold Its very important you limit your contact with the baby while the blisters are oozing or weepy Please contact your pediatrician right away to advise him or her of this development Your pediatrician will have additional instructions about what to do and when it is safe for you to have more contact with your baby You asked a very important question and Im glad you realized there was a potential risk here By the way Im sorry to hear about your shingles That is a painful disorder and I hope the rash clears up quickly Wishing you well First of all your nanny must not come into physical contact with your baby That is the number one priority Technically its contact with the weepy blisters of shingles that can cause an unvaccinated person to contract chicken pox but with a 10monthold you dont want to take any chances I would keep nanny separated from baby until the blisters have resolved Secondly you should speak to your pediatrician about getting your baby  If youre concerned about the purported link between pediatric vaccinations and autism rest assured there is no link There is absolutely no scientific evidence linking vaccines with autism  but there is plenty of literature about the public health benefits of immunizing your children The fact your child is now potentially exposed to varicella is a classic example of why children should be vaccinated If you have questions about immunizing your child please have a long conversation with your pediatrician who can give you all the facts about it so you can make a truly informed decision Wishing you well Great question A lot of people dont understand that while shingles itself is not contagious shingles can cause chicken pox in someone who never had it and was never vaccinated Its imperative your husband not come in direct contact with any of your  If its possible you might rub against each other during sleep you should consider sleeping apart until the shingles blister phase passes During the day you can keep your blisters covered to avoid anyone touching them This should help protect your husband Your husband should consider getting the varicella vaccine which would protect him against both chicken pox and shingles The vaccination would not be immediately effective so he would still need to avoid contact with your rash After your shingles outbreak clears up you might think about getting the shingles vaccine in order to avoid or minimize a second bout Shingles can be a very painful condition and Im sorry youre going through this I hope it clears up quickly Wishing you well Yes it certainly might Shingles can afflict anyone but its most common in people over the age of 50 The is approved for anyone over age 50 and the Centers for Disease Control CDC recommends everyone over age 60 receive a single dose of the the vaccine Even if youve had an outbreak of shingles in the past you still may benefit from the vaccine The shingles vaccine has been shown to reduce the risk of developing shingles by about 50 and it also may shorten the duration of nerve pain due to an outbreak If you have a weakened immune system or are allergic to any of the components of the vaccine you should not get vaccinated Id suggest you speak with your health care provider about whether or not it would benefit you to receive the shingles vaccine Hope this helps Yes you can In fact anyone who has had chicken pox can get in the future Thats because shingles is caused by the same virus that causes chicken pox Like chicken pox shingles is caused by the varicella zoster virus Once the virus has gotten into your body it gives you chicken pox After youve recovered from chicken pox the varicella zoster virus lies dormant inactive in your system If it ever reactivates it causes shingles Shingles can occur any people of any age but the rate of shingles increases as you get older According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC about half of all shingles cases occur in people over age 60 There is a vaccine available to protect people age 60 and over from getting shingles If you do get shingles your doctor also can treat the symptoms of the outbreak with various medications If youre over age 60 I suggest you talk with your health care provider about whether or not the shingles vaccine is right for you Hope this helps  is caused by the same virus that causes  Shingles itself is not contagious What I mean is you cannot get shingles from someone else who has shingles Shingles contagious from the standpoint that you can get chickenpox from direct exposure to shingles blisters In other words if a person has never had chickenpox and has not been vaccinated against chickenpox that person can get chickenpox if they come in contact with shingles blisters However if you have had chickenpox or shingles you cannot get shingles from coming in contact with someone who is having an active outbreak of shingles A shingles outbreak is triggered from within your own body It is not caused by contact with someone else So to answer your question you do not need to avoid contact with your dad You also should be aware that you can get the if youre over age 50 even if youve had an outbreak of shingles in the past I hope this helps Im sorry to hear youre going through this My concern is that you dont have at all Normally shingles isnt described as hives all over the body that itch In fact if you have welts on both sides of your body as divided by the spinal column then I can guarantee you do not have shingles Shingles only affects  Even though you dont currently have health insurance Id suggest you find a way to get checked out by a medical professional preferably when youre having an outbreak of these hives Most communities have free or lowcost medical clinics to serve people who have no insurance You can locate one of these clinics near you by calling your local Medicaid office or by performing an internet search for free health clinic and your city name I wish you all the best at finding a solution to this annoying condition This is an excellent question and Im glad you asked According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Preventions CDC shingles vaccine fact sheet you do not need to avoid contact with infants after receiving the shingles vaccine The CDC website states It is safe to be around infants and young children pregnant women or people with weakened immune systems after you get the shingles vaccine There is no documentation of a person getting chickenpox from someone who has received the shingles vaccine However if you develop a rash around the injection site you should cover it until it disappears Hope this helps Sorry youre going through this misery First lets not jump to the conclusion this is  though it certainly sounds like it could be Id suggest you see a medical professional for an accurate diagnosis As you know if it is shingles you may be able to take a prescription medication to help with the pain If its not shingles your health care provider may be able to provide you with treatment for whatever it actually is Try to refrain from pulling your hair out as this can cause permanent loss of hair in those areas Also remember shingles in the blister stage is contagious and can cause someone whos never had to come down with the illness To help avoid this make sure youre washing your hands thoroughly and often Also do not share any combs brushes or other personal hygiene implements I hope you get a diagnosis quickly I had shingles before but I never had the chicken pox vaccine or the chicken pox so it is possible You say have shingles 3 weeks ago  the little red tiny spots may have not related with shingles  because it is a long time  First you can daub some medical which cure Skin allergy  and you can put on a face mask  so that you can reduce The virus from other person  if you had do these  your symptoms continue  i think you should have a doctor  From what Ive learned in a short amount of time is that if you have shingles you are to stay away from pregnant women and people who have not had chicken pox I dont know Most vaccines is a small dose of the live virus The way it works is it allows your body to build its own antibodies so you may get symptoms when given the vaccine to fight off the virus now  in the future usually it will allow you to fight the illness while keeping you from getting the symptoms My husbands father had them and I also worked in the medical field Yes they are  They can also cause terrible pain can get anywhere Ive had an outbreak myself and know what youre going through It is highly possible People do not have to have had chicken pox in order to get shingles Having the vaccine does not mean that you will not catch shingles I had the varicella shot as a child and still got chicken pox Vaccines can lesson the intensity of the disease though When I had just completed a year of chemotherapy infusions and radiation for breast cancer my white count was extremely low A week later I developed an extremely painful rash across my stomach upper abdomen just under the breast bone and it spread around my side and onto my back It was diagnosed as shingles It was extremely painful My doctor prescribed hydrocodone for the pain and sent me home to suffer for the next month or so until it subsided It can appear and spread anywhere on the body It can even get into eyes mouth and genitals The pain can often last a very long time My shingles spread from the front of my body around to the back in the area of the bra line and below Shingles is tough because it typically requires evaluation by a doctor or health care provider and prescription medications to help speed the recovery and for the pain There are no overthecounter creams that can be used for the pain and stinging Shingles is tough because it typically requires evaluation by a doctor or healthcare provider and prescription medications to help speed the recovery and for the pain There are no overthecounter creams that can be used for the pain and stinging Generally the shingles vaccine is covered by Part D prescription drug plans You should contact your Part D plan directly for more information Generally the shingles vaccine is covered by Part D prescription drug plans You should contact your Part D plan directly for more information Shingles is contagious and can be spread from an affected person to babies children or adults who have not had chickenpox But instead of developing shingles these people develop chickenpox Once they have had chickenpox people cannot catch shingles or contract the virus from someone else Once infected however people have the potential to develop shingles later in life Shingles is contagious to people who have not previously had chickenpox as long as there are new blisters forming and old blisters healing Similar to chickenpox the time prior to healing or crusting of the blisters is the contagious stage of shingles Once all of the blisters are crusted over the virus can no longer be spread and the contagious period is over My husband had shingles and both my daughters got chicken pox The incubation period is 14 to 21 days from the time they first are exposed He had them on his chest and they did not come in contact with that part of him but they got them anyway I think exposure is more than touching the scabs evidently But the old saying that if you get them once you wont get them again is only true with chicken pox If a person is susceptible and exposed and their resistance is low they will get shingles if exposed to them or if their body wont fight it off Some people opt for a shot that Im not sure of the name of it but if a person gets it within a certain amount of time after the recover from the shingles they are less likely to get them again But they say it is quite expensive So just being in the same house and touching things the person with shingles has touched will cause a child to contact the chicken pox as it is of the same virus Yes The same virus the varicella zoster virus causes both chicken pox and shingles So someone with shingles can give the virus to someone who never had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine With shingles the virus is transmitted by contact with the fluid from the blisters Shingles is not as contagious as chickenpox which can be spread through droplets in the air as well as by casual contact The risk of spreading the virus when you have shingles is low if you keep all the blisters covered Once the blisters have all crusted over you will no longer be contagious This usually happens within 7 to 10 days Here is what the CDC recommends to help reduce the risk of spreading the virus if you have shingles \tCover the rash \tAvoid touching or scratching the blisters \tWash your hands frequently \tAvoid contact with pregnant women who have not had chicken pox or the vaccine premature babies and people with weakened immune systems To be on the safe side I would avoid contact with the grandkids until all the blisters are crusted over You will be able to enjoy your grandchildren soon enough when you are feeling better The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC recommends that all adults age 60 and older should get the shingles vaccine even if they have had shingles in the past There is a small risk that you can get shingles again and the vaccine can decrease this risk even further Any reaction to the vaccine is generally mild This may include soreness redness itching or swelling where the shot was given Some people report a headache or a slight rash around the site of the injection There are some people who should not get the shingles vaccine This includes those who are allergic to gelatin neomycin or any other components of the vaccine People with a weakened immune system or who are pregnant should also not get the vaccine Your doctor can go over your specific risks and benefits to see if the vaccine is right for you For more information about the shingles vaccine check out the following article in WebMD In a healthy adult the shingles shot has not been shown to increase the risk of a shingles outbreak In fact it lowers your risk of getting shingles by about half And if you do get shingles you will be less likely to have postherpetic neuralgia This is the painful condition that can occur after the shingles rash is gone Since the vaccine is a weakened chickenpox virus the CDC recommends that people with weakened immune systems should not get the shingles shot This includes people with AIDS or certain types of cancer People who are on medications that suppress the immune system like long term steroids or some cancer medicines should also not take the vaccine Also women who are pregnant or may become pregnant should not get the shingles shot Common side effects from the shot can include redness itching swelling and tenderness at the site of injection According to the CDC these mild reactions occur in about 1 out of every 3 people who get the shot About one in every 70 people will get a headache after getting the shot Rarely a mild rash may appear around the site of the shot that can look like chicken pox The CDC recommends that everyone 60 and older gets the shingles vaccine The FDA has approved the vaccine for anyone over the age of 50 Ask your doctor if the shingles vaccine is right for you Shingles or herpes zoster is caused by the chicken pox virus Once you have had chicken pox the virus remains dormant in your body When this virus reawakens it causes a blistering rash called shingles If shingles affects the trigeminal nerve on the face it can cause sores to appear on one side of the mouth tongue and palate Other viruses including herpes can also cause blisters around the mouth Click on this link for more information about shingles Your doctor knows your health the best and whether there is anything about your health that would make the shingles vaccine a problem However there should be no reason that radiation therapy many years ago would keep you from getting the shingles vaccine As long as your immune system is healthy you should be able to get the vaccine Yes you can get the flu shot and the shingles vaccine on the same day That means two shots because you cant give them in the same shot However the CDC does not recommend giving two live vaccines on the same day That means the organisms are live but weakened The nasal spray flu vaccine and the shingles vaccine are live So you cant get those on the same day In fact the recommendation is to wait 4 weeks in between However theres no problem with the flu shot the virus is dead and the shingles vaccine on the same day Shingles is contagious so there is the potential that you could pass the virus to one of your patients particularly babies and children or adults who have not either had the chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine As long as you have new blisters appearing you are contagious You should likely avoid contact with patients during this time as it will be difficult to know if theyre immune Once all the blisters have crusted over and no new ones are forming you are no longer contagious and can return to normal work duties You can ask your doctor about antiviral medicines for shingles as that may help shorten the duration so that you can safely return to work sooner You can get the shingles if you have ever had the chicken pox Yes anyone who has had the chicken box can get shingles Yes you can have a shingles out break anywhere on the body yes Hi You have not said what you looking for so have a look at this link it may help to see what you do want Good Luck httpwwwnhsukConditionsShinglesPagesSymptomsaspx  Hi This first advice come from the Uks NHS httpwwwnhsukConditionsShinglesPagesTreatmentaspx Just copy into google to the www To open and

httpwwwearthcliniccomcuresshingleshtml And yes just google nthe same OK lots of advice just hope something helps you Good Luck Hi Why not see your doctor get some tests done with him or ask him to hook you up with a breast doctor this way you could get to the bottom of it Good Luck Hi This is from Matthew Hoffman MD here on WebMD hope its the answer your looking for Its uncommon though not unheard of for shingles to affect the external area around the vagina called the vulva Its very unusual for shingles to affect the inside of the vagina itself but it can occur Shingles is the common name for herpes zoster the painful rash that results from reactivation of varicella virus in adulthood Most of us are infected by varicella virus as children when it causes chickenpox After we recover from chickenpox varicella doesnt disappear but rather goes dormant hiding inside nerves under our skin for years Later in life varicella can erupt on the skin to cause the painful rash called herpes zoster or shingles Varicella is in the herpes virus family but is distinct from HSV1 and HSV2 the herpes viruses that commonly affect the lips and genitals Varicella is much more likely to affect external skin than moist mucous membranes inside the mouth or vagina Ulcers or sores on the vagina are more often due to HSV1 or HSV2 herpes infections Taking a viral culture from the site of a fresh ulcer is the only way to know for sure though Do hope this helps you Good Luck Hi just google this anti shingle vitamins lots to read lots you could take Also go have a look on wwwearthcliniccom under shingles lots of ideas of stuff you can take But from what your saying it may have beaten you to the line Good Luck Hi Unfortunately some people can get scarring after shingles goes away You want to avoid sunlight because the sunlight can change the colour of the skin as it is healing But avoiding sunlight is no guarantee that you will not have shingles scars which appear as white marks on your skin in the area where the shingles rash used to be Do hope this helps Good Luck Hi Try looking on wwwearthcliniccom on there you may find a herbal way out of shingles should be a cheaper way to go Good Luck  Nothis is not a problem He can use the shower Yesthere is a correlation Chicken pox shingles and other forms of herpes cold soresfever blisters and even genital herpes are ALL caused by the same herpes virus No Without seeing your bumps I cannot be sure you have shingles either Shingles is typically not in the middle of the back but rather follows a nerve pathway on just ONE SIDE of the body so in your case it would only be on one side of the back perhaps traveling the front but never crossing the midline The can be a bit itching initially but shingles is notorious for being painful or burning Yes This is an essential preventative service That would depend on the type of contact Shingles herpes zoster is a contagious virus by direct contact Many people with active shingles have them on the chest or trunk covered by clothing In this situation a direct contact with the herpetic lesions would be unlikely If the person with shingles had them on the face then a face to face contact can certainly spread the virus to any susceptible person pregnant or not Just being in the same room is fine because shingles is not transmitted through the air Herpes in pregnancy is dangerous and is something that must be avoided so it is always best to limit contact of any pregnant woman with any person with active shingles or other herpetic lesions Unfortunately the shingles shot is not 100 effective so there is a chance you can still get it Before relying on a selfdiagnosis see your medical provider so you can be properly examined and diagnosed Shingles follows a nerve pathwayon the SKIN  Shingles can certainly be on your chest and cause a considerable amount of chest pain with coughing or even breathing but shingles should not get in your lungs Unfortunately yes Shingles is caused by the herpes virusthe same virus that causes fever blisterscold sores chicken pox and herpes stomatitis a herpes infection inside the mouth I do not know where you have the shingles but if it is an area that is covered by clothing this will help prevent the spread to your baby You will need to keep your hands very very clean Please call your babys pediatrician for more patientspecific advice Absolutely Shingles can occur many times in the same place but not always at the same intensity or severity It depends on the location of the shingles but skintoskin contact can definitely spread this herpes viruses A person with active shingles is usually in pain and may not be particularly interested in sexual activity anyway Vaccinations MAKE your immune system healthier Medical provider do not test patients to see if they can take a particular vaccine There are very few contraindications for getting a shingles vaccine so I do not know what your concerns might be Research the vaccine online and you will see that many of your fears may be unfounded Your doctor needs to prescribe a prescription pain medication shingles is VERY painful Unfortunately I do not know anything about you or your case to suggest a specific medication so is really your doctors obligation to provide you with some help A narcotic medicationfor a week or sois very appropriate To recommend that you only take overthecounter medications for pain control is an underestimation of your pain level There are stronger medications for the itching too Yes Reexposure to the chicken pox virus in a vaccinated person may result in shingles I cant see your rash but onesided blisters are more likely to be shingles Kidney stones do not cause rashes and the type of pain is extremely deep Yeseven young children I saw an 18 month old with shingles on her butt about a week ago in my clinic As you may know I cant blindly diagnose you over the Internet but I can tell you that chicken pox lesions look like dew drops on a rose petal tiny blister on a red base Herpes zoster the same virus also tends to have blisters at first but in groups These are painful and only ONE side of the body Pimples and white heads do not sound herpetic to me Nojust the one type of vaccine Only if the shingles are on your face Shingles follows a specific nerve pathway Yes it is safe assuming that she does currently have an outbreak Even if she does as long as it is covered by clothing like on her chest it is fine If her shingles is active on an exposed surface like the face she should not have direct contact with the baby or you YesONE SIDE of your hip Herpes zoster shingles is painful follows a particular nerve pathway and will only occur on oneside No Shingles is caused by the Herpes virus  the same virus that causes chicken pox These are HUMAN viruses not related to rats or bats Not knowing the location of the Shingles that is difficult to answer but assuming it is NOT on his face or around his eyes he can go back to work Shingles on the chest or back can be completely covered by clothing and will not pose a contagious risk to others If he is comfortable and no longer in pain then it would fine to return to his job Shingles can have systemic whole body effects like fatigue headache malaiseetc but it would be uncommon for shingles to directly cause a sore throat nasal congestion and coughing My guess and it is only a guess is that your symptoms are coincidental There are no rules in medicine that state a person can only have one health issueproblem at time or that all current symptoms are related to just one cause No Blisters Yes Those blisters form in clusters Seeds No but of course I have no way of seeing these seeds firsthand so I dont know what you are describing Yesyou can have both vaccines at the same time This is a weakened LIVE vaccine so their is a small possibility that this virus can be transmitted to your husband Talk to your doctor and your husbands doctor if he has a weakened immune system cancer treatment etc first to see if their are any contraindications in your particular case Here is a product link that may help httpwwwzostavaxcomwtmcidZX09T Shingles can occur in many areas of the body If the outbreak is on his chest back abdomen etc where it can be easily covered by clothing the risk of transfer will not be very high If it is on his face then more caution against direct skintoskin contact should be exercised Assuming that he is currently under treatment usually with an oral antiviral medication this will also reduce the chance of spreading it to others Your two year old is vulnerable assuming they had a varicella chicken pox vaccination at age one If not exposure to shingles can actually give an unimmunized person chicken pox For you assuming you had chicken pox as a child or the vaccine you are also vulnerable from direct skintoskin contact Do the best that you can without treating your husband like a leper Not everyone who is exposed will even get it but a few simple precautions like covering the area with clothing will help Studies have not proven that Llysine has any beneficial effects on herpes zoster shingles Since I dont know the location or details of your shingles or your immune state I can only offer some general suggestions if you are treating this at home Shingles is painful so assuming you can take ibuprofen this would be advisable This medication is antiinflammatory and will reduce your pain hopefully There is an overthecounter cream made with capsaicin an extra of hot peppers believe it or not that can also help There are a few different brands so a pharmacist can help you pick an appropriate one Ringworm is a FUNGUS not a virus Shingles is a herpes virus They are totally unrelated I dont know the location of your shingles or the severity of your illness but you can carry on normal activities and diet Eat what you want Keep the lesions covered by clothing if you can If it is on your face you could not do this Wash your hands very carefully if you touch the lesions dont share towels and avoid direct contact of those lesions to anyone including children who are not immunized to varicella chicken pox When the lesions all dry up and you are feeling better the chance of spreading it to others would be remote B12 does have some beneficial effect with shingles but it will not cure or make the infection any less severe There are other antiviral medications that are more helpful but you can certainly add B12 if you want I am not exactly clear on your question but Shingles also called herpes zoster is a form of herpesthe same virus that causes chicken pox fever blisterscold sores and genital herpes The incubation period for chicken pox virus herpes is about 2 weeks or so Causal exposure to someone with shingles in a child who has been immunized I dont know your childs age or if your child had one or two vaccines is not likely to lead to a disease outbreak Discuss it with her doctor anyway Yes Shingles herpes zoster follows a particular nerve pathway so the lesions would only be on ONE SIDE of the public area If you have not had this problem professionally diagnosed I would strongly suggest that you confirm that this is indeed shingles You can see this eruptionI cannot so seeing your dermatologist is the appropriate next step A description is really not sufficient to make an accurate dermatological diagnosis let alone rule out such obscure things as skin cancer There can be HUNDREDS of reasons Incidentally it would be highly unusual to have cancer in this area so dont worry too muchjust have your dermatologist make this important call Autism has absolutely nothing to do with genital herpes Your genital herpes was caused by sexual contact with another person who has genital herpes assuming your diagnosis was correct I have no way of knowing if you were misdiagnosed Only if the shingles is in the earscalled RamsayHunt syndrome If you had this herpes infection in your ear area it can also cause tinnitus in some people If you have herpes on your butttinnitus would not be related Shingles does NOT break out on both sides of your buttocks it follows a nerve pathway and nerves do not cross over the midline of the spine so I am guessing you have an incorrect diagnosis You likely have something other than Shingles causing your skin eruption Yes active shingles herpes zoster is contagious by direct contact and sometimes even by indirect contact hands objects clothing etc if the exposure is fresh Infants have a very immature immune systems so exposure to herpes zoster may cause chicken pox varicella the same virus A child over one year is likely to have had the varicella vaccine and would be less vulnerable but a child under age one is likely to be at risk It would be best not to have direct contact with the baby at this time at least until you shingles has completely resolved As a grandparent you can certainly SEE the babyshingles is not airborne Since shingles can appear on many different body surfaces chest back face etc it is best to keep this area covered if possible until the lesions have resolved Nothis will not work or help It may even make things worse First it needs to be conclusively PROVEN that he actually has shinglesThe wrist is not a place one would usually see it since herpes zoster the medical name for shingles follows a nerve pathway There are lab tests that can be done ordered by his doctor including a direct herpes culture to any fresh sores that he may get I see shingles quite several times a year in my pediatric practice I cant say it is common but shingles does occur in children As this point I would question the diagnosis since shingles also tends to break out in the exact same area each timenot on the shoulder once and then the wrist Yes this is possible Lymph nodes react enlarge and become tender in response to inflammation and Shingles can certainly do that Two things Once you have Shingles herpes zoster you will always have it The bodys immune system will usually suppress it and keep in from breaking out but it will still be there You will always have the potential for a recurrent outbreak but about half of the people will never see it again Shingles in not treated with antibiotics It is a virus and viruses are immune to all antibiotics No The pertussis vaccine and shingles vaccines are separate injections Noyou already have shingles It is just in remission suppressed by your immune system You can get a shingles relapse at any time but a new exposure will not give you shingles again If that tingling is in the same area where you developed shingles than you may be getting a relapse Noshingles is a VIRAL infection herpes zoster Assuming you do have shingles your description was not convincing a person must have had chicken pox in the past A new exposure to someone with chicken pox may give you shingles herpes zoster Since chicken pox is contagious a day before many people do not know who exposed them 2 or 3 weeks prior Chicken pox varicella is very contagious by direct contact or fomites objects contaminated by the varicella virus Shingles is really the same virus but fortunately not as contagious One can get it by direct exposure however Not usually unless the shingles is in your ear canal RamsayHunt syndrome Eardrums can spontaneously rupture for a variety of reasons and a person can have more than one unrelated medical problem at the same time Yesthat would be a good idea Shingles will not jump off of you onto someone else so as long as your shingles is well covered by clothing you will pose little risk to most people Since babies have not been fullyimmunized it would be wise not to put them at risk for a herpetic infection You need to see your medical provider again You may have postherpetic neuralgia  a painful condition after having Shingles There are treatments for this but they are prescriptions I am not sure why you had the chicken pox varicella vaccine Is it possible that you had a shingle vaccine that was called a chicken pox vaccine They are the same herpes virus It would be good to confirm what you received before getting another one If you did get a varicella vaccine you can still get the shingles vaccine For more information on the shingles vaccine httpwwwvaccineinformationorgzosterqandavaxasp Yesof course I have diagnosed shingles in a twoyear old child If you have had chicken pox or the vaccine then a reexposure could potentially cause shingles Yesusually in the same or same general area If you have it on the right side of your chest the first time it is likely to be on the right side of your chest the second time but fortunately it may not be as severe Not at a greater risk but you will certainly remain at risk Many of those past diagnoses of having chicken pox multiple times as a child may be misdiagnoses Many illnesses can mimic varicella especially the mild cases It would not be likely that you would catch shingles or chicken pox from this very cursory contact of just running together If you did have a close contact skin to skin you may have a remote chance of getting chicken pox the sam virus I have never found that the Shingles vaccine aggravates tinnitus I got mineand my tinnitus did not change It is just as bothersome and annoying as it was before the Shingles vaccine4 Maybe It would be a good idea for you to have your doctor order a varicella titer  a test to determine if you have immunity to chicken pox If your titer is low or nonexistent then yes exposure to the herpes virus the cause of both shingles and herpes either from someone with chicken pox or direct contact to someone who has active shingles can cause you to get chicken pox I have even seen shingles in toddlers so you are not alone There are antiherpetic viral medications for shingles herpes zoster like Famvir or acyclovir and others and your doctor should be prescribing it for youNOW You are unlikely to get sick if you take both shots at the same time They are totally different vaccines with different sideeffects and immunological responses I often give killed flu vaccine and live chicken pox vaccine on the same day to children If those vaccines are free to you and you do not have any contraindications to receiving them then I do not see a problem Both diseases are miserable so since they can be prevented then go for it Shingles are caused by the herpes virus Cold sores are also caused by the herpes virus Canker sores and HPV are NOT herpetic Yesyou can get Shingles if you are adequately reexposed to the varicella virus the same herpetic virus that causes chicken pox Shingles is only on one SIDE of the body following a nerve pathway It is very PAINFUL Poison Ivy can occur anywhere on the bodyboth sides It is very ITCHY not painful They are both blistering skin eruptions but shingles tends to be hemorrhagic bloodylooking and occurs in clusters Poison ivy tends to have clear blisters and likely as some linear linelike patterns where part of the plant contact occurred I cant tell you what you have not enough information and no ability to examine you but I can tell you that shingles does not occur on BOTH sides of the face Shingles closely follows a nerve pathway and those pathways never cross the midline of the facethey stay on just one side If your primary care medical provider has not been able to properly diagnose you then you may need to see a dermatologist Yes If you had it on both thighs it would not be shingles Shingles follows a nerve pathway and these nerves do not cross over the midline of the body It is not likely that your granddaughter has shingles on BOTH of her hands Shingles follows a nerve pathway and occurs just on one side of the body like the face chest or back Shingles is caused by the herpes virus the same virus that causes fever blisters cold sores and chicken pox Shingles does not occur on both hands so that blisterlike rash needs to be properly diagnosed It could be a form of eczema impetigo handfootmouth disease or any number of skin conditions that can occur on the hands Check the bottoms of her feet and inside her mouthif you see similar lesions it may be hand foot and mouth disease  A search of WebMD will provide you with more information on this curious childhood illness Remember that just exposure to an infectious disease yes shingles is contagious does not necessarily mean the exposed person will get it It would be safe but if you have already had shingles and the vaccination why get a second Shingles vaccination Talk to your doctor but I dont think you will need vaccine at this point I strongly recommend returning to both the eye doctor and a dermatologist While it isnt common blindness can be caused if the shingles virus infects the eye If the blisters are anywhere near his eye this can be a concern It is also possible that the antiviral they have him on simply isnt effective for him I was prescribed two different antivirals to treat my shingles outbreak last fall because the first wasnt giving the results we wanted probably due to an incompatibility with my own body chemistrythats what the dermatologist told me The chickenpox vaccine first became available in 1995 Im not sure when you received your childhood vaccines but it is likely that the vaccine was not available during that time Talk to your doctor to see if you qualify as a susceptible adult and would benefit from receiving a vaccine against chickenpox You might first be assessed for immunity and if you did not show immunity you could be vaccinated if your doctor recommends it Even if you have had chickenpox there is no significant risk to receiving a second vaccine When caught within the first 48 to 72 hours the administration of antivirals can help to weaken the virus After that period of time using antivirals is ineffective At this point treating your symptoms of pain become the primary concern Not everyone develops postherpetic neuralgia but there is no way of determining who will Keep yourself wellhydrated and eat a healthy diet keeping yourself as healthy as possible and try to manage your stress as you continue to heal You are wise to begin treatment so quickly for your shingles infection This will help to limit its spread However even on medication the shingles lesions are going to erupt where the infection initially began because it is present before the rash develops Hopefully yours will be a mild case and being on medication will limit the extent to which it will spread Please have your husband get the vaccination According to the CDC you can get the vaccine after having had a shingles infection Im very sorry to hear about your recent shingles infection This is a very painful condition because the pain runs along your nerves resulting in postherpetic neuralgia nerve pain that can last for quite some time after your shingles infection is gone How it will affect your fibromyalgia is not an easy answer Pain is debilitating and having fibromyalgia puts you in a position of further debilitation from the shingles pain I recommend going back to your doctor prior to the end of your vicodin prescription for a very frank discussion of the pain and what it means to you That might depend on where the lesions are Generally speaking shingles are not contagious However it is best to avoid touching another person with the lesions until theyve healed over No No I just took my mother Inlaw to er for pain in left side Then we notice had red rash on her stomach They said she had shingles It can even come around face if around eyes can be blinding Yes that is very possible I was told the virus lays on the tip of nerves around your spine If you have had chicken pox you have that virus They can be very very painful  After an outbreak of chickenpox usually in childhood the virus that causes it stays in your body lying dormant in certain nerve cells Although your immune system usually keeps the virus in check anything that affects the immune systems ability to hold back the virus  illnesses immunosuppressive drugs severe stress or agingrelated changes for example  can allow the virus to return with a vengeance Early symptoms of shingles include burning or shooting pain and tingling or itching generally on one side of the body or face For some people the pain is severe It may be accompanied by fever chills nausea diarrhea and difficulty urinating The pain and tingling are followed by a rash which begins with reddish bumps most often on the trunk In a few days the bumps become fluidfilled blisters which usually crust over and fall off after seven to 10 days Even when the rash goes away the skin color at the rash site may be different Also nerve pain may persist at the site of the rash a condition called postherpetic neuralgia About onefifth of people who get shingles develop postherpetic neuralgia In most people the pain goes away within four months from the first sign of the rash Shingles is typically easy to diagnose Your health care provider will suspect shingles if you exhibit the typical symptoms of rash on one side of the body along with sharp burning pain and a history of chickenpox Shingles can be quite painful Many people who see their doctor for shingles say it was the pain that ultimately led them to seek treatment Some report that the sensation of anything brushing across the inflamed nerve endings on the skin is almost unbearable Even when the rash is gone postherpetic neuralgia can persist sometimes for years Shingles can cause other lasting complications as well If it occurs on the face it can damage your eyes Shingles of the eye can lead to scarring which can damage your vision It can also lead to glaucoma an eye disease that can cause blindness later in life Shingles can also cause hearing or balance problems as well as weakness of the muscles on the affected side of the face In rare cases shingles can spread into the brain or spinal cord and cause serious complications such as stroke or meningitis an infection of the membranes outside the brain and spinal cord According to the CDC more than onethird of people who get shingles will develop serious complications People whose immune systems are suppressed because of medication or diseases such as HIV run the greatest risk of complications Complications are also more common among people over age 60 which precludes women of childbearing age Nevertheless if a shingles outbreak affects your eye or you notice any symptoms outside of the area of the outbreak you should speak to your doctor right away The incidence of shingles in pregnant women is very low If you are planning to get pregnant and are concerned about shingles speak to your doctor about the possibility of the shingles vaccine If you are already pregnant practice healthy habits and let your doctor know if you have any symptoms Early recognition and treatment will minimize the risk of complications for you and your baby My eye health was damaged by a stroke and being a weak part of the body it gets shingles in it sometimes If you have it in the eye it is very painful You can feel it in the eye and in the nerve at the temple going upward and toward the back of your head 20 years ago my husband and i both got shingles at the same time i was 36 and he was 56 we had just moved out of an apartment complex where there was at least 10 cases of chicken pox with the little kids i had chicken pox as a child but my husband said he did not when we asked the drhe said it is not contagious that when my husband was little he probably had a minor case and no one knew i asked how that could happen my doc says when one person gets chicken pox the next person to get can be so minor they only get 1 or 2 chicken pox and go on never knowing they had it or the virus Chances are if you have lived in the US for most of your life you have been exposed to Chicken Pox even if you didnt show symptoms The virus remains dormant in your body and then reactivates as Shingles  any more questions contact your local pharmacy Pharmacists are very educated on Shingles and there is a vaccination for it as well which is recommended for anyone over 50 1 out of 3 people will get Shingles in their lifetime Its my understanding that if you have not had chicken pox and are exposed to shingles you can actually catch chicken pox  since they both come from the same virus But I dont think you can actually catch shingles I have never heard of this I always thought that shingles and chicken pox were from the same virus but have never heard of this connection yes Yes Dont know most a person touch the infected area to get shingles from someone Shingles is very painful Touching it or not You will still have pain It can be constant or intermittet of and on My 14 yr old daughter has the same thing  definitely shingles on her head where she had a total of 2 chicken pox as a 6 mos old the blisters are in clusters down the back of the left side of her head When you get to her body though she has the dew drop single chicken pox looking blisters It is as if she got shingles where she had the 2 original pox but has chicken pox on the rest of her body  both sides of torso effected front and back right side of face singly splattered NO pox at all though on the right side of her head SHE IS IN PAIN TOO if you expose him to it he will only catch CHICKEN POX which if you have it once you can never get it again I had a small breakout on the end of my nose but the shingles were actually internalup my nose and in my ears and throat My husband also got a shingles vaccine last year and within two months got an awful case of Bells Palsy His doctor say the vaccine could NOT have caused the Bells Palsy because the formula for this vaccine does not contain LIVE virus culture I remain skeptical because my husband also has a rare blood disorder AFTER his diagnosis with Bells I researched more and found that live culture vaccines are never recommended for anyone with a compromised immune system like my husband Still a Neurologist specializing in Bells Palsy has since told us that the cause may never be known so we cant narrow it down to a possible vaccine His facial paralysis was almost gone 8 months later until today Symptoms are back we are starting over can a person with shingles spread it though intercourse yes So I bought an online remedy to relieve the painful itch of shingles Apple cider vinegar And it relieved the pain well enough for me to be able to sleep and work is shingles contagious shingles are known to be so painful that you would not wish them upon any personI have heard them described as raw nerves being pinched with red hot pliersI cannot speak about alzdisease I dont know They are contagious for up too 24 weeks or until scabs form over the top of the rash area Shingles are not contagious However if you have not had chickenpox you may develop chickenpox after being exposed to shingles Only the drainage from the blisters can spread herpes zoster  which is the virus that causes shingles and chickenpox Once the blisters crust over they are no longer contagious and before blisters break out the virus cannot be spread If you have had the chickenpox the herpes zoster virus is already lying dormant in your system To put it in a nutshell one person with shingles CANNOT spread shingles to another person I have been a nurse for 25 years and cared for those with shingles numerous times yes yes Hey hun i am 24 and was diagnosed with shingles 10 days agoits very rapidly spreading alsoi wen tto the ER for minethey gave me acycloveir and kefflexalso went back last night and they put me on prednison and ultram for painwhich anyone who has had shingles knows that ultram is like taking sugar  they told me to take tylenol at firstthat didnt work thoughobvioiuslyso when i went to the ER last night they told me to follow up with my primary doctorso i am getting a new doctorhope you are on some meds also i have found that if you are trying to hide your shingles so they dont spread i went to williams brothers pharmacy and they had this sleeve type thing that i bought for only like 3 dollarsits like a compression sock type thing  It helps somewhatwhatever you do DO NOT take a hot shower or use heat in any way IT BURNS BAD so use ice and luke warm bath waterget some lavendar bath salts and relax  hope this helps you good luck  Can you go swimming with shingles can you go swimming with shingles I am waiting for an answer 7 years ago I started to experience pain in my right rib cage area Over the course of the next few months I had ultrasounds MRI xrays CT scans in addition to a number of treatments for pain that included light therapy and nerve blocks Finally I was diagnosed with postherpetic neuralgia without ever having experienced a rash breakout assocaited with shingles in that area It has now been almost 7 years and the pain in my rib cage remains Some days worse then others and almost alwasy worse with over activity Did not realize that you could even have PHN without having had the rash outbreak and still find myself searching for answers 7 years alongM DefinitelyI have had them 4 timesfinally got the shot which is covered by my medicare supplamental plan YES This time last year I had the shingles and I have NEVER had Chicken Pox I thought you wouldnt get shingles if you never had chicken pox But I got them on the right side of my neck in my hair line and behind my ear There is a small area in my hair line that still itches most of the time So it seem that you can get the shingles just about anytime That is just my opinion I had shingles at one point but mine didnt hurt it only itched really bad but I was taking ibprofin 3 times a day for a staff infection So if she is on any antiflammitory meds it may be keeping her from feeling any pain From what my doctor has told me because I did have it at one time It is not an airborn virus so the only way that someone can get it is if they themselves touch the infected area or the person who has it has touched it then touches something or someone without washing their hands If you have not had chicken pox or been vaccinated for chicken pox you cannot get shingles but you would break out with chicken pox Yes mine started right above my ear on my scalp and ended up running over the ear and across my right cheek to the corner of my bottom lip But it began as one single blister on the scalp which my quick thinking Primary Care doctor found when I went in with stabbing pain in that area no you can not My mom just finished having shingles She was in so much pain she could not stand it She went on line looking for something that would take the pain and itching away She came across a product that was expensive but at that point she didnt care She purchased it and tried it She could not believe it when her pain was gone and the itching was no longer She still has one spot that itches everyday and I put some on that spot It says on the jar that everything is all natural It has been so worth the money to her She has bought extra jars for family and friends that have gotten this So far everyone of them said it took the pain away and stopped the itch Maybe it might help you It is called terrasil and she found it online I hope this might help you Vicki Chick From experience one can contact chicken pox from being around shingles My 4 year old got chicken pox 2 weeks later after being exposed to my husband with shingles yes You dont want shingles believe me it is horrible Get the shot If your 4 year old hasnt had chicken pox or the vaccine he may catch chicken pox from you but not shingles You are able to get chicken pox since youve never had chicken pox unless you have been vaccinated But you will not get shingles since you have not yet had chicken pox I dont believe that massage will end her nerve pain but it can help relax her a bit A massage works better to help muscle pain A medication can be prescribed to help with the nerve pain by making the nerve endings less sensitive Cymbalta is one of the medications that works well If your sister does not have open sores then she cant pass it to the therapist Yes i dont know I have the beginning symtoms of shingles What danger does this pose to my 3 year old grandson "}
