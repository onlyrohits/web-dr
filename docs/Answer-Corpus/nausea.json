sludge in my gall bladder and they wont do sergry to remove it becauase its not life threatening so I asked a triage nurse and she told me to drink a glass of cranberry juice everyday for a week and drink lots of water and avoid all fatty and greasy foods eat alot of fruits and vegetables blueberries are really good because they have antioxidanrts and antioxidants are really good for liver and gallbladderyou can also take antioxidant pills hope this helps I WAS TAKING PILLS BUT NOW DISCONTINUE BUT IT STOPS MY PERIODS ALTHOUGH I M NOT PREGNANT HOW TO GET PERIODS AGAIN Pls go to your dr and check for appendicitis My son had this Sounds like a UTI urinary tract infection even if its not this you should see your doctor Good Luck see your General Practitioner they can help advise you It is possible that you are pregnant If you want to be sure take a home pregnancy test or make an appointment with your doctor If the home test comes back negative you may want to see your doctor anyways just to make sure everything is okay Tell her to goto another doctor those are also symptoms of a heart attack Dont want to cause undue worry but I had those symptoms that was leading up to my heart attack While ovulating your body can produce its own symptoms I would check with your doctor to see if this is a possibility Also be sure to take follow up pregnancy tests to ensure you are not pregnant as pregnancy can still occur with Plan B as well as bleeding similar to periods Excessive use of any pain reliever is not good for the liver and because of alcohol usage your maximum tolerance for acetaminophen is probably lower than average Its hard to say how much damage your liver has taken because everybodys body chemistry is different Giving your doctor a quick visit might be ideal just to be sure that the damage isnt threatening in any way This might be a useful link to you httpwwwhealthharvardedufhgupdates12thingsyoushouldknowaboutpainrelieversshtml I had preeclampsia with my son All it took was a urine test for them to identify You swell up all over too with it and my face was very swolen when they induced my labor They check the amount of protein in your urine and if you have too much of it they run about two more urine tests where you pee in a bucket thing for 24 hours cause if it goes up so high you have to be induced for the danger it does you and the baby Mine wasnt allowing Sky to gain weight and he was already practicing breathing for labor at 34 weeks They induced me at 35 weeks and he was 4 lbs 2 oz when we left When I had preeclampsia I felt hot all over and dizzy Especially when I showered or stood for very long The point is though is that I was having the symptoms of preeclampsia for months before it came on full force symptoms like yours The best thing that you can do is rest and rest a lot Stress brings it on thats how mine came on so you just need to not worry about it because they check your urine and every time you have an appointment thats one of the things they check for As long as you dont have a high enough protein count in your urine you should be okay When I had Sky mine was so bad I couldnt see him until the next morning at I had him at 413 pm All you can do is take it easy Theyll let you know if you get into the danger zone thats one thing they check for every time you pee in the little cups they give you I really hope this settles your fears Stress brings it on so try and relax for now Yes I was nauseous with both of my pregnancies early on I never threw up I was just constantly icky feeling Good luck It very well could be a number of things such as nerve damage in your neck migraine or even vertigo Best thing to do is to talk to your doctor right away and see what could initially be causing this pain Your experience could have been caused by literally dozens of conditions Some of the possibilities include I suggest that you start off by seeing your family doctor That person knows your medical history best and can begin a basic investigation by way of diagnostic testing Additionally the family doctor may refer you to other medical specialists including a cardiologist and neurologist The short answer is yes I bet that someone somewhere is allergic to almost every food product or their individual ingredients The human body can sometimes be very unpredictable It may quickly reject food through the process of allergic reactions Some folks will outgrow allergies while some folks will suddenly go through an allergic reaction after having ingested a food product for many years in an uneventful manner As a matter of interest I just recently returned from a same day medical clinic because I had experienced a systemic itch for the past three days The doctor diagnosed my itching to my taking an antibiotic called Bactrim The odd think to me was that I had no allergic symptoms during the first 5 days of taking this medicine Powered sugar is also known as confectioners sugar sugar

processor until blended completely into a powdery substance Congratulations on making the decision to cease your alcohol consumption You are describing a condition called Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome Withdrawal side effects from alcohol in the body affects individuals differently Some will experience none to little in the way of side effects while others will have severe physiological and psychological symptoms Around the 4th or 5th day the symptoms of Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome tend to be at their highest level of intensity At this point in your individual detoxification from alcohol the acute physiological withdrawal symptoms should be under control Some of these symptoms may include sweating headache vomiting low grade fever blackouts intense thirst hallucinating seizures hand tremors racing heartbeats generalized anxiety and others Withdrawal from chronic abuse of alcohol over the course of years is serious business and can result in a medical emergency situation In situations such as your alcohol withdrawal medical supervision would have been the preferred method Your current uncomfortable physical and psychological symptoms should be investigated and not ignored Based upon your history of heavy alcohol usage I strongly recommend that you have a complete physical examination ASAPto assess your overall health It is possible that some long term neurological conditions and deleterious system changes or organ damage may have resulted from years of heavy alcohol dependence No matter what lingering negative symptoms that do remain youre still ahead of where you would have been without stopping Over the course of time the quality of your entire life should improve for the better I applaud your efforts at restoring normalcy into your life The challenge now is to remain abstinent from alcohol usage through life style changes and support systems that you put into placeYou just got off from a swaying 24 foot ladder at perhaps the 20th foot If you get back on the same ladder it will be at the same 20th foot After years of chronic alcohol dependence unfortunately we dont get the opportunity to start over again at the first rung of the ladder Best wishes for your continued success According to  during a heart attack nausea can be a typical symptom This occurs because Nausea is the sensation of feeling like you need to vomit

eating responsibly and taking your insulin as directed Many conditions can cause dizziness including ear disorders heart disease consuming alcoholand certain medications Because of the many possible

disease that can be life threatening It is a horrible disease and can result in a painful death What was the cause of your acute pancreatitis It is crucial to know the original cause of your condition and that treatment had been and continues to be directed at that cause Causes may be attributable to chronic drinking of alcohol my brother rarely even drank a beer digestive conditions and sometimes heredity factors I recommend that you consult with a University Hospital Endocrinologist Specialist to receive the highest quality of treatment for diseases that may be related to the pancreases Allow me to clearly address all of the points included with your question as follows Dark urine may be a result of taking some medications ingesting various foods liver and kidney disease or urinary infections Because your negative symptoms are limited to having dark urine and fatigue I suspect that a urinary track infection is more likely than having contracted Hepatitis A Please consider seeing a physician to have diagnostic testing completed It could be something else you need to go to doctor and see why are you having all these problem maybe your ovarian cysts came back I cant really say I just advise you to see your doctor I hope this help you Good Luck Luv You got a serious problem you need to go see your doctor Next time you might dont be so luck Go see a doctor you need help Actually yes you could still be pregnant The only form of birth control that is 100 effective is abstinence I know women who have gotten pregnant while on the pill I realize that Im a little late in answering your question but it is possible The answer is yes the only form of birth control that is 100 effective is complete abstinence The effectiveness of the pill is very user dependent Typically about 8 women out of 100 that use BCPs will get pregnant during the first year of use However when used as directed only about 1 in 100 women get pregnant Remember that this degree of effectiveness with the pill depends on you taking the pill exactly as directed and at the same time of day every day Abnormal or breakthrough bleeding is common during the first few months of use and its very normal This typically is just an adjustment that the body needs to make to the newer levels of hormones The duration of this abnormal bleeding pattern depends on the type of BCP you use and often can last much longer in women taking continuous dose pills To ease your mind get a pregnancy test done Many over the counter tests can detect pregnancy as early as 67 days before a misssed period Also remember that BCPs dont protect against STDs so if you are sexually active use a backup method like a condom It might be related to your birth control assuming you just started it many people have stomach problems as a side effect to starting new medications A doctor can sometimes prescribe a different medicine for the same purposecondition as different medications even for the same condition can have different fewer or sometimes worse side effects Thanks for your responseI went to the Dr and I am pregnant and I live with my childs father so it wasnt any need to get in touch with him Hes been supportive thus far Thanks again You have a fast metabolism like me I dont think theres nothing wrong with it with the exception that when we go out to a restaurant for dinner is like Ahhh I will be back and you come back half an hour later like are you ok where did you go so it can be sometimes a little bit embarrassing Overall I think there is nothing wrong with that See a gyn for check up and follow up How long has this been going on Have you been to the doctor to see if maybe you have an allergy to bananas Or to see if you could possibly be pregnant If u experienced a period in my experiences not a docformer medic in army and worked in emergency rooms combat situations etc plus have wife sister 16 yr old daughter 10  8yr old daughters who live with me since their birth and wifes family mostly women as well a sign of a period plus periodlike symptoms such as the bloating suggests a pms cycle But nausea drowsiness may suggest something else like a cold or flu this time of year may be stressrelated depending on your personal life I would contact a nurse or obgyn professional for further information to other medical possibilities and get a proper pregnancy test to rule it out or confirm I hope i helped For your any dental problem plz click here  confidentdentalcare  For your any dental problem plz click here  confidentdentalcare  For your any dental problem click here  confidentdentalcare it is almost five months now since i order a pregnancy spell cast on me on Facebook Oduduwa Ajakaye i saw in a website on how he help a couple to get pregnant and i contacted him which i started seeing changes on my body since the first week of last 4 months and i am 18 weeks gone and i am carrying my own baby in my womb i am so happy that i finally got pregnant after all i have been through contact him for any problems you are having he will surely provide you a solution All thanks be to him it is definitely possible to get pregnant while on the pill especially if you have only been on it for a couple months your body may not have absorbed and reacted to the hormones at a normal speed You should take a pregnancy test very soon If it is negative take one more 12 weeks later If they are both negative it is possible these are just sideeffects of how you react to this specific birth control If it continues to be bothersome or gets worse go to the doctor have a proffessional pregnancy test done and asuming it is still negative discuss changing your contraceptive method If you feel uneasy or uncomfortable it is always best to consult your doctor Its better to be safe than sorry Goodluck  It may be possible I took a home test this morning and it was negative But I think It was due to user error I dont think I provided enoughumwell you know to get a correct reading Are those normal signs of early pregnancy Im very sorry to hear that happened to you I hope you are all right My boyfriend and I have been trying to concive for about 5 or 6 months now Ive had my period every month since then and I feel like Ive taken a million home tests I havent got a positive since we started trying Ive just assumed that is taking a while I know its normal for it to take a while and not to be worried if its been under a year Would it still be possible to be a miscarage if I dont think I was prego in the first place Did you have a dull almost cramp like pain in your lower right abdomen and whole lower back Its been like that all day and Ive been nauseaus all day I have not gotten sick but it feels like I could at any moment I hate to contradict the doctor but new studies are showing there is no correlation between marijuana consumption and harm to a fetus Depending on how you consume it may be a factor I would definitely not smoke it If you are in a medicinal state I would find a doctor who deals with medicinal cannabis as they are going to be the best ones to answer all your questions 100 I have known multiple women who have used cannabis throughout their entire pregnancy and their children are healthy and very intelligent A pharmacist gave me the suggestion to try Dramamine for nausea and vomiting It has worked for me The symptoms you described happen often in people that work out without drinking enough water Even if you think youre drinking plenty try drinking more and see what happens You need to call your gynecologist as soon as possible to determine if you are in fact pregnant or if youre having trouble with your IUD An intrauterine device IUD is considered an effective birth control method so you should not be able to get pregnant However no form of birth control is 100 foolproof If you are pregnant and have an IUD its important to get a diagnosis as soon as possible You cant go through an entire pregnancy with an IUD in place Its also possible for an IUD to become dislodged or penetrate the uterine wall In short a number of scenarios could cause the symptoms you describe and you need to find out whats going on as soon as possible Best wishes to you I think you need to call your gynecologist or primary care provider for an appointment and some blood work A number of conditions could cause the symptoms you describe among them anemia or low red blood cell count Dehydration also could produce this type of symptom so be sure youre drinking enough water Youve suffered enough waiting for this to clear up on its own Now its time for some medical intervention I think I hope you feel better soon No this is not OK Yes you should see a doctor or psychotherapist or psychiatrist is very common and there are many very good medications available these days to treat it The same is true of  which might be what youre experiencing and which could cause the shortness of breath nausea and stomachache you describe You are not alone in your feelings Many people experience the same things which I hope brings you comfort A doctor can help you figure out whats going on and suggest treatment for you You deserve to live a happy full fulfilled lifeYoure worth it Personally I do not believe in taking antidepressants without talk therapy also called cognitive therapy I think you might benefit from a combination of both and I encourage you to seek this help I wish you all the best This is a great question and Im so glad you asked Many people associate gastrointestinal upset nausea diarrhea with the flu influenza but actually the true  Sometimes people refer to the stomach flu which is actually a condition called gastroenteritis The nausea and diarrhea youre experiencing likely are caused by something other than influenza A Have you by chance taken antibiotics recently If so that class of medications can cause gastrointestinal upset This condition usually gets better after you finish the course of antibiotics You also should consider eating yogurt or taking a probiotic to help with antibioticassociated diarrhea Be sure to drink plenty of water whenever you have diarrhea  and wash your hands thoroughly in case youre carrying a bug that can be passed to others If the diarrhea doesnt clear up within 14 days or so another trip to the doctor is in order to try to figure out whats causing the problem Wishing you well Im sorry to hear youre going through this Unfortunately a number of things could cause the symptoms youre describing Id suggest you keep working with your health care provider to find a cause for these symptoms Even though youve undergone some testing already if you dont have a diagnosis you need to keep pushing Dont give up on this A number of conditions that could cause the symptoms you describe can take a long time to be diagnosed Its important you work closely with your health care providers to get all possible testing done in order to arrive at a diagnosis Also sometimes tests need to be repeated and the results compared to previous tests in order to get an accurate diagnosis I suggest you keep copies of all your own medical records including films from CT MRI etc in case you have to change doctors or opt to get a second opinion Again Im sorry youre dealing with this and hope your care team can arrive at a diagnosis and some treatment options soon All the best to you Youre right Since the Duchess of Cambridge was admitted to the hospital with HG everyones been asking what it really is Hyperemesis gravidarum literally means excessive hyper vomiting emesis due to pregnancy gravidarum Many women get morning sickness  nausea andor vomiting  in the early stages of pregnancy so a lot of people are asking why Kate Middleton had to be hospitalized for what amounts to a bad case of morning sickness Hyperemesis gravidarum however is a serious medical condition A woman with HG may lose as much as 5 of her total body weight due to fluid loss This can not only put the baby at risk but can cause electrolyte imbalances in the mother that can lead to a heart attack Fortunately HG is a very rare condition Most women never have morning sickness that reaches the level of HG The Duchess of Cambridge was simply unlucky in this respect Hope that explains things for you Lack of a bowel movement for 3 days doesnt by itself indicate constipation Constipation is defined based on each individuals normal bowel habits Some people only have one bowel movement every few days Other people have a BM every day You need to determine your boyfriends normal bowel routine before jumping to a conclusion of constipation Assuming this is constipation however if laxatives pills arent working you have some other overthecounter options to try If your boyfriend is otherwise healthy he probably can safely drink a bottle of magnesium citrate liquid laxative Follow this immediately with 8 ounces of water Usually this will induce a bowel movement pretty rapidly If that doesnt work you can try a glycerine suppository This is inserted into the rectum to induce a BM Use it only as directed on the label Or you can try a disposable enema often called a Fleet enema Enemas are generally considered safe to use and will help get those bowels moving again No guy I know would voluntarily submit to an enema You need to emphasize to him that small disposable enemas arent too uncomfortable to use  and theyre way less uncomfortable than emergency surgery for a bowel resection due to an obstruction Maybe that will help persuade him if things get to that point If your boyfriend still cant have a bowel movement starts vomiting andor begins running a fever over 101F you need to seek immediate medical treatment These could be signs of a bowel obstruction or something unrelated to constipation Wishing you both all the best If the symptoms dont go away within a few hours or if they get worse I suggest you go to the emergency room or an urgent care facility or call a nurse advice line Shakiness or tremor is a known side effect of  so this symptom should go away as the level of gabapentin in your system goes down If you continue to experience shakiness after taking gabapentin in the future you should notify your doctor immediately That said there is no reason you cant take both the gabapentin and the lortab at the same time Although both are painkillers they work in entirely different ways Without getting too technical gabapentin works directly on nerves at the synapses Lortab hydrocodone plus acetaminophen is a narcotic with Tylenol that works primarily by binding to opioid receptors within the central nervous system Because these two drugs work differently you generally can take them at the same time without any adverse interactions between the two However you should verify this information with a pharmacist It also wouldnt hurt to report your tremor side effect to your pharmacist so it can be noted on your profile I hope your shakiness calms down soon and I wish you all the best Well this certainly deserves a trip to the doctors office You can start with your primary care provider PCP It may turn out to be nothing but unexpected violent episodes of vomiting shouldnt be ignored when they happen multiple times Many things could cause this including a food intolerance or allergy It would be best to get the PCPs opinion as to what might be causing this Meanwhile it would help if your son kept a log of what he ate just before vomiting Also it would be useful to know if his bowel movements are regular of if hes frequently constipated Not that hes going to want to discuss these topics Constipation can cause vomiting in some cases I wish you and your son all the best with this So sorry to hear youre going through this How unpleasant Many conditions could cause the symptoms youre describing Anything from food poisoning to the flu could be at work here If you spike a fever over 101 degrees then its time to seek medical attention If you dont have a thermometer for taking your temperature I recommend you get one Its impossible to determine whether or not someone has a fever by simply feeling their forehead or judging by whether theyre sweating or things like that You really need to get a thermometer and measure your temperature accurately If youre not feverish then you probably can take a waitandsee attitude Drink plenty of fluids and dont try eating anything while youre actively vomiting or nauseated sick to your stomach If the symptoms continue to get worse if you get a fever or if you get sharp pains on the right side of your abdomen then it would be a good idea to see a health care provider I hope you feel better soon Well this is an excellent question for your health care provider Id suggest you make an appointment as soon as possible with your primary care provider to discuss whats going on Many conditions can cause the symptoms youre describing To receive a diagnosis you need to be examined by someone who can provide ongoing care If you had testing done at an emergency room find out if your doctor can access the test results electronically by computer If not youll need to have the results sent to his or her office Unfortunately this isnt something that can diagnosed in a forum like this But I do wish you all the best in finding resolution to your problem Im sorry your mom is going through this It sounds like a very uncomfortable situation If its been less than a week since your mom saw the doctor then you may just need to hang in there awhile longer The symptoms you describe could be caused by many conditions including a cold virus You may need to take a watchful waiting approach to see if the situation gets better or worse If it gets better then great If it gets worse Id suggest a return trip to the doctor Keep in mind Im just making suggestions I am not in a position to suggest a diagnosis or give medical advice Hope your mom feels better soon Im so sorry youre going through this It can be very frustrating to feel sick and not get a diagnosis I have a couple of thoughts for you First doctors work well with data So I suggest you literally keep a record that contains this information What you ate When you ate it When your symptoms seem better and when they seem worse When you have a bowel movement and what it looks like I know ew but it could be useful information in obtaining a diagnosis Note when a specific symptom begins such as nausea and when it ends What medication you took and when you took it Your temperature taken with an oral thermometer every 46 hours be sure not to take your temperature after eating or drinking anything hot or cold After youve collected several weeks of data try going back to your doctor He or she may see a pattern that might point to a certain diagnosis Above all hang in there and keep trying Some conditions such as gastroparesis can take years to diagnose I know thats not what you wanted to hear but I want to be honest with you I hope you feel better soon Im sorry to hear youre going through this It sounds miserable and worrisome I want to emphasize your need to stay hydrated even if drinking water gives you nausea Maybe try drinking water at different temperatures to see if one is more palatable than another Or see if theres a vitamin water flavored water or type of sports drink you can tolerate Despite the fact youve been tested for and other conditions in the past my advice to you is to keep pursuing a cause for your symptoms Some conditions take a long time to be diagnosed such as  Sometimes tests need to be repeated periodically and the results compared in order to reach a diagnosis Its OK to be very proactive with your health care providers in pushing for additional testing or repeated tests depending on how much time has elapsed in order to get a diagnosis Id suggest keeping copies of all your lab results and imaging films Usually these can be provided to you on CDs for easy storage Youll want to keep these for new doctors you may consult and for comparison of test results over time I wish I had some magic suggestion to offer you in terms of a diagnosis but thats not the case Like I said hang in there and dont give up just because youve had a few tests done Keep going back to your providers to let them know you still have symptoms I wish you all the best Im sorry to hear youre going through this frightening experience On the plus side you and your doctor are doing everything right it sounds like All the tests you listed are appropriate for diagnosing whats causing your symptoms Unfortunately your health care provider just hasnt been able to pinpoint the problem yet I wish I had an answer for you but the symptoms you describe could be caused by many many things Thats why your health care provider is running so many tests The only thing I can offer is empathy for your situation It is so hard to be patient when you are experiencing severe symptoms like this and see yourself losing weight I hope your doctor is able to come to a diagnosis quickly Meanwhile dont forget to lean on friends for support Venting your anxiety may help you feel better I wish you all the best Rather than a doctor Id recommend you try a dentist While emergency rooms generally will treat a dental problem most doctors defer to dentists for all things toothrelated And your issues sound toothrelated If there is an infection developing your dentist either will treat it or will refer you for medical treatment Its possible for a dental infection to cause ear pain facial swelling and the other symptoms you describe Sooff to the emergency dental center for you Or call your regular dentist explain the situation and try to get in today If they cant see you ask them to recommend an alternative provider Dental infections are nothing to mess around with Feel better soon Unfortunately its impossible to tell what the problem might be without a physical examination Difficulty urinating is not a symptom to be taken lightly It could be caused by a urinary tract infection kidney infection or even a stone Any of these conditions could cause additional problems if not treated The difficulty urinating also could contribute to the nausea and vomiting If these symptoms dont clear up quickly Id suggest you seek immediate medical treatment Hope this helps Well the first thing I have to ask is Is your daughter sexually active If so and shes missed a period then it might be wise for her to take a home pregnancy test At age 15 the menstrual cycle isnt necessarily settled in yet Irregular periods arent uncommon in that age group and the stomachaches and nausea could be due to stress or anxiety In other words I wouldnt jump to any conclusions If your daughter is not pregnant and the other symptoms dont go away then its worth a trip to see your primary health care provider He or she can investigate the cause of your daughters symptoms and recommend treatment Wishing you both all the best If your girlfriend is experiencing a fever over 101F you should seek immediate medical attention If shes not feverish and has recovered from passing out Id suggest you carefully monitor the situation and keep her wellhydrated Dehydration can cause a person to faint as can low blood sugar If the vomiting doesnt clear up within 24 hours you should call a doctor or consider visiting an urgent care facility Best wishes to you both I guess my main concern here is that youre not following up with your medical provider Who ordered the blood work Did they tell you to come back for a followup appointment If not you need to schedule an appointment anyway because youre symptomatic Your health care provider is the only person in a position to give you a diagnosis and help interpret the lab results so I suggest you go back to see him or her as soon as possible I hope you feel better soon ABOUT A YEAR I am not a doctor just an informed medical consumer I would have someone take you to the emergency room Your symptoms are suspcious of bleeding in the digestive tract perhaps significant since you are lightheaded If you are reluctant to do that at least call your doctor If hes not available I strongly suggest having someone take you to the emergency room You are brushing too far back stimulating your gag reflexOr you need to change tooth paste Sounds more like allergy symptoms Your not moving enough stool it is building up  causing the problems You will find OTC meds will not work that well you need to find foods that will allow you to go on a regular basis I had this very problem  found Cherrios or other wheat based products help move things along even if its just wheat toast Congrats on the decision to quit alcohol use The thought of experiencing painful withdrawal symptoms is what prevents millions of individuals from seeking alcohol detox The truth is that the severity of your symptoms will depend on how much alcohol you have been consuming the frequency with which you have been drinking and how long youve been doing it During your alcohol use chemical toxins have been collecting in your system Detox is the process of flushing those chemical toxins from your body Your central nervous system has grown accustomed to your alcohol intake so when you stop drinking your body may begin to crave something it is used to getting that you are no longer giving it This is exactly what withdrawal symptoms are and they may present in a number of different ways Alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be both physical and psychological Physical symptoms usually include  Insomnia  Sweating  Headache  Nausea and vomiting  Increased heart rate  Loss of consciousness  Tremors  Seizures Psychological symptoms may also include  Fatigue  Anxiety  Irritability  Depression Symptoms may begin within a few hours after the last time alcohol was consumed and may last up to 48 to 72 hours It is important to note that psychological withdrawal may continue long after the physical symptoms subside Many AA members in recovery report having psychological cravings years after they stopped drinking Another complaint that some people experience during detox that is more serious is the occurrence of DTs or delirium tremens The DTs usually emerge within three to five days after you quit consumption and are periods of confusion disorientation and hallucinations Delirium tremens can also be physical such as the shakes and sweating and if left untreated they can be fatal IV therapy medical detox is seen as one of the best methods for alcohol detox as it works to reduce the amount of withdrawal symptoms experienced by the individual IV therapy medical detox should be administered under the supervision of a physician and is relevant because it allows the physician to make any necessary changes to the medication protocol as the withdrawal symptoms change which keep the patient comfortable Gallus Detox Center is a private alcohol detox facility which specializes in IV therapy medical detox For questions about our facility or method for detox you can call us at 8553386929 Xanax is part of a class of drugs known as Benzodiazepines and is prescribed for anxiety and panic disorders You may have heard the terms SSRI selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or GABA gamma amino butyric acid  Xanax changes brain function by altering GABA production in the brain at the receptor sites which alters the persons mood When used appropriately Xanax is very effective Studies have shown that longterm Xanax use can lead to dependence and addiction Quitting Xanax use cold turkey can be dangerous because the nature of the drugs slows GABA Gamma Amino Butyric Acid production

associated with parenteral cyanocobalamin or vitamin B12 given by injection have included dyspepsia nausea vomiting and mild transient diarrhea These side effects are very mild or not present at all with oral vitamin B12 Again the side effects can occur but usually at higher doses You really need to see your physician He will most likely refer you to a Neurologist The numbness and the headache can be serious and should be checked out with an MD immediately Hi I have had 4 previous pregnancies I have children aged 10 8 4 and 2 With my second I tested negative for pregnancy this was picked up by blood test when I went to the Doctor for pain The hgc levels rose too slowly and they thought him to be eptopic but then found him behind a large cyst I was 8 weeks My pregnancies with my last two girls I had 2 periods or period type bleeds with each My period was due on the 9th of January I am usually quite regular Instead I had pain in my lower right ovary location and headaches and cramps all the signs of a period My period then arrived on the 13th I started to feel sick the pain on the left increased and I also had pain in the right My period lasted 3 days and was half its normal flow or at least I used half the pads maybe less than half changing them to be clean rather than them being full I went to the Doctor he put me on the pill and said to come back in two weeks In the last week I am having cramps they feel like braxton hicks this is the only thing I am able to relate them too I have pressure down there The pain on both the left and the right has gone I am now feeling a bulge above my pubic bone it seems to be a pointed bulge It is bigger before I urinate and when I am standing and my jeans have become uncomfortable I still have a week before I go back to the Doctor but this is worrying me now I feel more sick every day but I understand this could be nerves I do not think I am a candidate for hysterical pregnancy I did suffer 2 weeks feeling incredibly broody in early December but quickly resorted back to my feeling of not wanting any more monsters lol The Doctor put me on the pill to ease my pregnancy symptoms and said to come back if the pain persists but it has stopped Is there anything you can tell me to put my mind at rest My Doctor gave me a look I am nervous about waiting to go back and nervous to go back in case he thinks I am wasting his time Thankyou Jasmine I forgot to mention that I had pre cancerous cells burnt away last year I know I got it tired once and cut but like you said it could have untied I took a test 3 days into me being late which came back negative but i have like I did with my first 3 so I have no clue Ive done my research on the tubal ligation and damn people still get pregnant after getting them tied So i dont know Hi there Happy to help First you should know what is one of the causes of liver cancer and that would be tobacco smoking andor genetic mutations from your DNA That means your DNA gets damaged and your body cant fix it But to get the professional help that you need its a good idea to check in with a doctor and tell himher your symptoms of liver cancer and the other symptoms that i am looking at for this question But if you are 78 years old then chances are that muscle mass will drop That is what happens when you hit the late ages If you have right side pain most likely you might have appendicitis So you must go to a hospital so they can remove that infected appendix Nausea is caused by appendicitis And feet swelling is mostly caused by late age so dont always panic if you get pain Darkening of your stool could be an indication of internal bleeding The flu influenza and the common cold are caused by different viruses The flu is caused by infection with influenza viruses The common cold is often caused by rhinovirus infection although a number of other viruses also can cause coldlike symptoms Influenza and the common cold have similar symptoms and it can be difficult to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone In general the flu is worse than the common cold and symptoms of flu including fever cough sore throat muscle or body aches and extreme tiredness tend to come on suddenly People with colds are more likely to have a runny or stuffy nose although the flu also can cause those symptoms Influenza infection can result in hospitalization and sometimes even death while colds are usually milder and generally do not result in serious health problems The best way to prevent the flu is by getting a flu vaccine each year Also good health habits like covering your cough and washing your hands can help stop the spread of many germs that make us sick I had the exact same symptoms I am an 18 year old female Im not sure which issue has caused the symptoms but recently I found out that I have a lesion in my brain and I also have hormone imbalances I would recommend seeing your doctor Keep searching until you find the answers I recommend going to the doctor Vomiting too often can damage your esophagus and it takes the nutrients from your body It could be a hormone thing a stomach issue a stomach ulcer Best to get it checked by a doctor it could be this I had some of those symptoms such as pain below the rib cage and vomiting i had multiple test done and then i went to the er and a doctor started at my rib cage pressing down firmly and worked his way down to my hips and it turned out that i had multiple compound stress fractures and torn it bands in both hips the pain in my rib cage and lower back was due to inflammation but non of my bone scans or CTs showed my stress fractures i am not entirely sure try Ibprophen Motrin aleve tylenol take an anti imflammatory pain reliever try ice packs heat packs to help with imflammation pain Stress can cause you to miss your period and it can cause nausea and vomiting and flu like symptoms take some anti nausea medicine to help relieve some of the vomiting What State do you live in I am 30 years old and not pregnant either but have been bloated nauseous and burping for two months now I fill full all the time My sister started with similar symptons three weeks ago now Something is very strange about this We thought it could be the winter weather change due to lack of sunlight I eat a very healthy and bland diet and feel very healthy otherwise I do not take any drugs not even birth control My sister thinks we have too much melatonin hormone She read in a hormone book that we may have high levels in the winter that remain in our gut and cause high acid levels in the stomach thus creating bloating and gas I thought I may have cysts so I went to the doctor for that but all was fine We are trying light therapy too so the daytime melatonin is not produced I am only five days into that What are your symptoms I have been bloated and burping for two months I am nauseous too though My sister and I are looking into our hormone levels We found that Melatonin is a hormone in your body and changes all the time like insulin levels In the winter with lack of sunlight melatonin levels can be high and stay in the gut creating high acid levels in the stomach We are trying full spectrum light therpy I have a coworker too who says he is bloated and always feels full right now I do not feel depressed or anything but maybe it is SAD Seasonal Affective Disorder the only way to know for sure is to go to your doc or to take a home pregnancy test I have no idea as I have never done anal but if you do not feel right since this in counter you should go to the docs just to be on the safe side This is a great question But of course as a pharmacist I have to ask the patient a few questions too because we need to find out what is the root cause Could this be more of a virus running around and causing that nausea and vomiting because in that case its really just flat CocaCola syrup over some ice and just letting it pass If it becomes very violent though and they havent been able to keep any food or water down you have to go in the emergency room because dehydration could cause more problems down the road So you want to be really careful about that If you are pregnant once again you cant really take the overthecounter products that are available such as Meclizine basically known as Dramamine or also Bonine Bonine is a chewable form of the product These are not safe in pregnant women so therefore they have to go more the natural route They could possibly try there is a wristband that they could wear around their wrist to help prevent that as well But if its just for motion sickness because it was on a boat which is very common for people or a train The products that are available Dramamine and Bonine are quite effective They may cause a little bit of tiredness because they are actually antihistamines and by causing the drowsiness they are actually calming down the center in your brain that causes the nausea and vomiting But once again as a pharmacist I am going to ask my patients a few questions first before I can help you find the right choice This is a common question that I get asked all the time and I really would advise the patient to not take Maalox with it Maalox can actually bind to the vitamin and will not make it work as well It will actually prevent it from being absorbed in the body There are a few tricks though that I recommend to my patients to help avoid this nausea feeling and part of it is number one Taking it with some food around meal time maybe dinner is a good opportunity to take your vitamins and as long as there is something in your stomach it may actually counteract that nauseous feeling Also I found that a lot of women take it at bedtime I recommend it pretty consistently and they say that it really works because you take it right before you go to bed You are sleeping so the vitamins are dissolving and you are not awake to experience that nauseous feeling But if you are having severe nausea talk to your pharmacist you may need to be switched to a different type of prenatal vitamin I will be more than happy to call your physician or healthcare provider to talk to them about that for you This is one area that we just dont have enough data yet Ginger kind of falls in the category of being a vitamin and herbal supplement It is regulated by the FDA but not as strictly and therefore they really havent done a lot of clinical studies or types of studies where we are going to say okay you are on prescription drug x does this interact with it So we really dont have that much data There are some concerns about ginger causing an increase in bleeding So you want to make sure that everyone knows that you are taking something like this Your pharmacist your doctor or whether healthcare provider make sure its on a medication list which is all the medications that you are taking So therefore if something does happen we are aware of it But right now we just dont have enough data to find out whether or not thats going to happen This is a good question No you cannot administer for oral use medications rectally because they will not work Medications that are approved for rectal use will say so right on the packaging are specifically made in a particular way so the medication can be absorbed into your body You could actually have the flu so you want to stay home from work and rest This doesnt mean you get to go to the mall or to the movies You can take Tylenol or acetaminophen for fever aches and pains You should focus on staying wellhydrated and eating a normal diet as much as you can If you dont start to feel better in a few days or develop a high fever contact your health care provider for further evaluation I would highly recommend heading to the ER and having it checked out Sometimes it could be an episode of severe heartburn or it could be something else  especially since you have pains in your chest  No you cannot administer for oral use medications rectally because they will not work Medications that are approved for rectal use will say so right on the packaging are specifically made in a particular way so the medication can be absorbed into your body I had pain and bloating for three years I tried all those medicines that I was prescribed I had an upper GI two ultrasounds two xrays a nuclear test and blood work No doctor could figure me out I tried their medicines I tried herbs and nothing seemed to work Finally I found mastic gum I started taking two in the morning along with Aloe Vera Within a week my pain was gone I have given mastic gum to a couple of other people who were miserable One of them had been off work for two months This guy was back to work the next week Another person who was having some testing done to figure out their problems took this stuff and the pain was gone within two hours I dont take it everyday anymore just when I need it I also try to eat very healthy and stay away from high fat foods especially I hope this helps I dont know about nausea but tightness in jaw could be caused by teeth grinding bruxism and TMJ I have both and it can cause a lot of pain not being able to open mouth very wide and headaches Maybe the nausea is related to something you are eating I just dont know You could have an hernia I would have it checked out by your physician I am not sure why but plain saltine crackers seem to be eaiser to keep down and makes my stomach feel better Sometimes however a pinch of just plain salt does the same thing for me I have been having the same issue and was told to monitor barometric pressure Ive noticed anything above 3020 begins the onset of headaches which in turn create migraines I also have a small aneurysm in one of the arteries along the brain so I have to monitor my BP and noticed that also creates headaches those are all symptoms of a migraine if you havent been diagnosed with them see a neurologist I wanted to further clarify that I do not get nauseous after eating am not pregnant and do not smoke or drink Thanks Yes Adderall can cause nausea as a side effect Taking the Adderall with food might help combat nausea But if it continues or is really bothersome you should talk to your healthcare provider It could be It is not advisable to combine alcohol with either phentermine or Xanax  Im sorry to hear you are having a hard time What is happening to you is called early satiety meaning you are getting full early in the eating process When this happens its best to see your doctor and describe your symptoms so he or she can run some tests It could be gastrointestinal GI related such as irritable bowel or gastroesophageal reflux disease GERD or something else entirely You need to find out whats going on as you are likely not getting adequate nutrition and no doubt your quality life is suffering Good luck It is important to rest the stomach and yet still avoid dehydration Clear fluids should be attempted for the first 24 hours of an illness and then the diet should be advanced as tolerated Clear fluids are easy for the stomach to absorb and include Water Sports drinks Clear broths Popsicles Jello It is important not to take too much fluid at one time since stretching the stomach may cause the nausea to worsen One to two ounces of fluid at a time taken every 10 to 15 minutes may be all that the stomach will be able to tolerate Milk products should be avoided for the first 24 to 48 hours during an episode of nausea and vomiting The enzyme that helps digest milk is located in cells lining the stomach With vomiting the body can become relatively lactose intolerant Abdominal pain bloating vomiting and diarrhea may occur I am very sorry to hear that you are sick but your specific question is not one that can be answered in this type of information forum If you have had diarrhea for 4 days and are having severe pain you really do need to see a doctor now Symptoms such as this can have many causes ranging from a virus food poisoning or diverticulitis all the way to a surgical emergency There is no way to tell what is going on without a physical exam and more information Any treatment will depend on what is causing your symptoms Start by calling your family doctor now Explain your symptoms Tell the doctor that you are unemployed and are having money problems Most doctors that I know will try to help you by reducing the fee or working out some type of payment plan He or she will also know what resources are available in the area and can give you further advice If you do not have a family doctor your city or county may have a free clinic But this will only help you if you can be seen right away Some areas have urgent care centers that may be able to see you right away for a fee If there is no way that you can see a doctor right now then you can go to the emergency room of your local hospital Once this health crisis has passed look into whether you can get help from the government You are eligible for Medicare If you are over 65 If you are younger and meet certain financial criteria you may be able to get medical assistance I hope you get the help you need now Well first off did you use protection during those sexual intercourses No increased heart rate is not a normal feature of heartburn However pain and anxiety can increase heart rate If youre still having this problem I would get your doctor to check it out When Mirena becomes embedded it may no longer prevent pregnancy So yes its possible You should give your doctor a call to see if youre pregnant or if something else is going on It is normal to feel sick for a day or two when you have acute pharyngitis The nausea could be caused by the antibiotic or just by being sick Try to eat something if you can  anything But if you cant keep water or liquids down you need to let your doctor know You dont want to become dehydrated Also if youre not starting to feel better after a couple of days give your doctor a call Several of the symptoms you describe such as diarrhea chest pains and stomach pains are not symptoms of pharyngitis so thats something you need to discuss with your doctor to see if something else is going on i would call here obgyn and schedule an app I would be careful when it comes to Excedrin my Anut has taken it since I was young and she has really bad stomach problems I dont know about taking the proper doseage although I do know its been taken off the shelves Could be CDiff go the ER now sometimes it could also be a sign of bulimiaunless you are on a steroid packet or some birth control pills with cause a large amount of hunger Try sticking to small meals every two to four hrs and see if that helps you might also want to get checked for bulimia and other things I know you may think that your not forcing you self to throw up but thats not all bulimia is aboutI had a friend of mine that had it and never thought of herself as fat or forced herself to throw upMy

cardiac it also could be ulcer related among other things You really need to have this evaluated especially to rule out a cardiac event Good luck and God bless My pain is through and through left side I also have spinal stenosis which may be a contributing factor And could a stomach ulcer cause the throbbing pain You can have up and down days and I think its a question of your body really getting adjusted to the med and how it has to work Its really a biological reaction and sometimes the body isnt ready to be totally adjusted The side effects you mention are found with meds but you should tell your doc about these too Smoking can cause foods to taste more bland Also I know cutting out sugar from your diet will allow your tolerance to go down and the flavor will be stronger again for example powerade used to taste very bland to me i cut down on soda and started drinking water a lot the next time i tried a powerade the flavor was overwhelming It is a gag reflex caused by brushing too far back in your mouth CONGRATS ON THE BABI If your husband has a fever I am surprised that his blood work came back nominal I would expect to see evidence of inflammation or elevated white blood cell counts He might be dealing with a viral form of bronchitis I went through something similar earlier this summer I had a wet cough that got worse at night for over six weeks If something like this is the case for your husband then a longlasting bronchitis that isnt responding to antibiotics may need other treatment My family doctor prescribed a course of Prednizone to reduce the background of inflammation in my viral bronchitis and allow my system to throw off the bug itself Your husband may wish to talk with his physician about whether a similar approach is appropriate for him as an individual Note although I am well read on some areas of chronic pain literature I am not a physician Regards Red Lawhern PhD Basically anytime that you have unprotected sex the condom broke you are capaple of getting pregnant however there are only a few days every month that you are ovulating Two days before your period is not the time you would be expected to ovulate so if you have a predictable regular cycle you are not likely going to get pregnant from this one isolated mistake However if there were other mistakes in the last month or so then anything is possible Wait another week or so and take another home pregnancy test or see your medical provider for a more accurate pregnancy test and exam You are having vague nonspecific symptoms that could be an indication of many different diseases Unfortunately it would not be possible to sort out the many possibilities blindly over the Internet There are hundreds if not thousands of medical conditions that could cause your vague symptoms It is impossible for me or any medical professional to be able to determine the cause of YOUR symptoms since we do not know anything about you your medical history or have any way of examining you or ordering diagnostic tests I would suggest that you head off to Student Health or an afterhour urgent care facility so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated Me too To make matters worse I have 12 chickens and lots of eggs that I have to give away Like you eggs in other products are just fine but plain eggs are not Many people develop food intolerances It may not be an allergy but it could be so ask your medical provider to order an EGG IGG allergy test It is not in your head I think any person with a significant head injury that may have been a concussion should be medically evaluated The fact that you are still having postinjury headaches dizziness and nausea indicates a need to be carefully examined Pancreatic cancer cannot be diagnosed by a simple blood test with borderline results but any person with abdominal discomfort for as long as you have suffered needs a very thorough diagnostic workup and imaging studies A reason for your nausea and diarrhea as well as a solution needs to be found Rather than just worry about pancreatic cancer you should continue the active pursuit as to the cause of your symptoms  is one possibility an inner ear infection that is really diagnosed by symptoms alone the doctor cannot see your inner ear You could be many many causes for your symptoms so consider getting a second opinion from a neurologist because of the headache You did not ask a particular question but I can comment Any person who been coughing for a month needs to be examined to determine the reason Since you are also having nauseavomiting which may or may not be related this is another reason for you to see a medical provider so you can be properly diagnosed and treated  two things that cannot be done blindly over the Internet Anytime that you have unprotected sex you have the possibility of getting pregnant so DONT DO IT And make that guy use a condom no matter what fairy tale story he told you about the 3 chance of getting you pregnant That is baloney Dont you know that men lie Yesyou could be pregnant so you can really take a pregnancy test anytime now but you may need to repeat it again in another week or so if you do not have your period Your medical provider can also order a very sensitive blood pregnancy test if you want to increase your accuracy Dont wait You need to go to the ER again Black tarry smelly stools usually indicate a gastrointestinal bleed stomach esophagus etc that can be lifethreatening GO NOW You can stay will hydrated Sara but it really sounds like you should be examined by a medical provider to determine the reason for your array of abdominal symptoms There are many many causes for abdominal pain and you should not be selfdiagnosing or trying to avoid seeing a medical provider Yes your period can be adversely influenced by an illness but yours has been late for three months Perhaps this is why it is late this month but as you know there can be many reasons for this as well Are you concerned that you are pregnant Since influenza assuming this is what he had only lasts about a week with the worst symptoms the first few days she has exceeded this time She should be examined for a secondary infection at this point Any time that you have unprotected sex you have the potential of becoming pregnant Your body is designed to get pregnant so it is really only a matter of time assuming your fianc is capable of fathering a child and you are ovulating Clearly you are both wanting this to happen otherwise you would be using some form of contraception It is possible to have a period for a month or more even when you are pregnant so if you are having the signs start doing a home pregnancy test every week for a few time or have your medical provider order a moresensitive blood pregnancy test Migraines just happen so you may be blaming the flu shot for an event that may have happened anyway The flu vaccine does not typically trigger migraines or at least I have not seen this reaction in my long years of practice Should you get the flu shot next year That is really up to you but I am a big fan of the protective benefits of vaccines including this one No Marijuana is not safe in pregnancy There are other medications that may be help but your OB must prescribe them Based on a list of symptoms alone there is really no way to blindly determine over the Internet if a person is pregnant or have something more serious You will need to have a handson examination with your primary care medical provider or your OBGYN You will most likely need some diagnostic blood tests or perhaps even an ultrasound Yes a person can have a gastointestinal virus without vomiting or diarrhea but those symptoms are typically the things you get If you had this virus before or a similar virus you may only have a mild infection with nausea You cannot definitively diagnose a Norovirus by symptoms alone since everyone responds to a viral infection differently That would be a difficult question to answer without the ability to examine you Cold and influenza are viruses and tend to cause similar symptoms Influenza tends to be worse usually with a fever response not just hot or cold flashes Influenza is a respiratory viruses some abdominal symptoms are not typical in adults kids with flu can get them though If I had to take a guess I would say that you most likely have a nasty viral infection but not necessarily influenza The only way to be sure is to have a rapid flu test If you have been ill for less than two days antiviral medications like Tamiflu can be used There is really nothing that can be done for a cold other than symptom control Treating the SYMPTOMS of colds and flu is often the only thing that can be done trying to feel better while Nature orchestrates the cure Both colds and flu last about a week with the first 34 days being the worst You need to see your medical provider so you can be properly examined There is absolutely no way to blindly determine the cause of your symptoms without a detailed medical history location of pain severity associated symptoms etc and a thorough examination of your abdomen You did not ask a particular question but clearly you need to be under the care of a good primary care providerinternist until these chronic issues can be solved As much as I would like to help you it would be not be possible to delve into your case over the Internet since it is going to take an extensive medical history a thorough examination and a plethora of diagnostic tests just to get started Yes you can get pregnant That is why the Implanon has an expiration datethe point where the hormone has depleted This may be why your period is not normal Use a secondary form of birth control like a condom or you will be just taking chances See your medical provider Yes Xanax can help anxiety your reaction to stress assuming this is what is causing your symptoms but it will not help the underlying causes of stress In order for you to be properly diagnosed you would need to see a medical provider for an examination and possibly some imaging studies Appendicitis would be listed among the many possibilities to account for anyones abdominal pain but be advised that their are many Since you have been symptomatic for five days now it is time for you to get some handson answers The ER doctor may be correct since inner ear disorders are really high on the diagnostic possibilities Most care cause by viruses that are selflimiting so if you can hang in there another week or so it may resolve If not your doctor should send ot you an ENT specialist  one that specializes in inner ear problems neurotologist for a higherlevel diagnostic workup This may include an MRI and a variety of inner ear diagnostic tests If you have been off birth control having unprotected sex and now experiencing no period breast pain and nauseathen OF COURSE you could be pregnant There can be certainly be other reasons to account for your array of symptoms but pregnancy would be high on the list and would need to be considered FIRST You need to be carefully reexamined by an ENT specialist While labyrinthitis still can be causing some of these residual symptoms there are many other ear conditions that can mimic it I cant examine you to determine the extent of your umbilical hernia so surgery may only be cosmetic It is really up to you to get it fixed butif it is a particular big and bulging one this may be an approach to consider Talk to a general surgeon  someone who repairs these  for patientspecific advice Your first and most important step is to see a medical professional so that you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated It appears that your problem is gastrointestinal so if your primary care medical provider cannot help you a referral to a gastroenterologist would get you on the road to recovery I am sure I am surprised that you have waited five months to get this problem evaluated Not very likely Umbilical hernias  at least the small ones  are usually asymptomatic Eight weeks of nausea is not likely related to an umbilical hernia so keep looking for the causereason Dont let your doctors throw in the towel Hi to both of you and I too am concerned about my wife Debra who is Type 2 seven rods in her back Dvt in her legs going thorough menopause has alllergies and she has all things that you have been experiencing You have to look at everything I tell my wife Debra to invesigate everything and find out what works for her and her Doctor said too that everything was fine I told her to research her Metformin and she decreased it by 1000mg a day Guess what she has never felt better all because she has been losing weight Everybody needs to adjust things in this life We also need to look at other things and it may be or not the problem like weather flu colds nurtition Try theses Immune Boasting Foods Elderberry Button Mushrooms Acai berryOystersWatermelonCabbageAlmondsGrapefruitWheat germLow Fat YogurtGarlicSpinachGreenBlack Tea Sweet Potato and Broccoli and my favorite beets My Wife just said it could be stress and or associated the nerves so the BVitimins would be area to start I have to go Bye Steve  Debra Ive cut my metformin to a 5oo mg in the morning and 500 mg at night I feel so much better I felt over medicated with 2000 mg a day Ive lost some weight so when you lose weight you need to have your metformin lowered I woke up a couple days ago and my blood sugar was 65 I thought I was going to die It scared me horribly I keep orange juice in the frig just in case My dizziness has gotten better since my metformin was lowered I was diagnosed with diabetes 5 months ago so Im new at this Im learning how to eat right Diabetes is to be take seriously if you dont take care of yourself you can go down hill fast I feel better when I get out and walk My name is Debra My youngest child never had a sore throat with strep When he went back to school every year I could count on a call from the nurse within two or three months and it would be strep He would have a rash on his torso and no other symptoms yes go to the doctors as soon as possible better safe then sorry It could be ovarian cysts like the ones I have but you should consult with a gynecologist to rule out or confirm this possibility Yes my 14 month old son is proof that you can get pregnant on the pill As my doctor told me its only 999 effective May be inner ear vertigo See your doctor the reason I cant get into the doctor is because I have no transportation My car broke down and I have no way to fix it as of right now Im no doctor but I would think an ectopic pregnancy is possible with no uterus Your symptoms sound serious You should see your doctor as soon as you can because an ectopic pregnancy is pretty serious And if that isnt the problem then they definitely need to figure it out Hello I have been through your same problemsIt is not a comfortable situation When I had this problem I went to my Family MDFirst he did a urine testwell this was all it took to figure out that I had a very bad bladder infectionBladder infections can cause nauseaback painleakageburning when you urinateand some pelvic painIn my opinion I would go see my Drbut until you can get into the Dr I would not drink any sodasany caffinealcoholor anything with high acid  things like OJDrink Lots Of WaterBut I would go to the store and get some Cranberry Juice or in the pharmacy in the Vitamins section there is a Cranberry Pill that is a Very High Concentrated Cranberry Oilwhich helps to clean your urinary tract One of these the juice or the pills will help you out a lotJust follow the instuctions on the back of the bottle of pills or if you are going to drink the juiceI would drink 46 ounces 4 times a dayuntil you see the DrInfo from someone who has been through thisI take Cranberry Pills everyday nowI have not had as many problems with this anymore and I strated taking the pills this about 3 years ago If you do start thismake sure to talk to your Dr about it when you see him for your appointment Good Luck To YouI hope this helps you and anyone else that may read thisGod Bless Youre most likely pregnant Get a home pregnancy test You have al the signs of dehydration and hypovolemia from poor fluid intake which causes your blood pressure to go down especially when you first stand up Since you are keeping food down now then I would try to find foods with the highest protein content like eggs peanut butter beans also fruit such as blueberries strawberries bananaswhich have a high potassium content that you loose with vomitingdiarrhea As a nurse I would definitely tell you to speak to your cardiologist about your symptoms as soon as you can Report all symptoms even if you dont think they are related SVT can lead to very serious problems but it is very much treatable with medications and other treatments Research your condition on the internet especially on the Mayo website and WebMd which are both very good and so you become knowledgable You need to know what symptoms are important to know about and what treatments are used You need to become your own best advocate Even though you are young I assume you are your condition may be hereditary or related to other factors such as caffeine or alcohol use Take this heart condition seriously get treated and monitor it so that you can go on and have a healthy life Thank you for posting your question here at WebMD Answers Your sons symptoms are too complicated to fully address here Please keep working with your doctor We wish you the best and hope that you get a diagnosis soon The WebMD Answers Staff There is no way anyone online can tell you whether you really have an appendicitis A health professional will need to examine you in person I dont want to alarm you but if you believe you could have an appendicitis do not wait Go to your local emergency room and get checked out You definitely dont want to have your appendix burst Here is some further information on that I hope will help Please take care WebMD Answers Staff You could be but the best way to know is go get a test done I would guess that vaginal dryness is the cause of your primary complaintthe lack of estrogena chief postmenopausal culprit If your vaginal walls are dry the motion of intercourse can make the penis like sandpaper to your delicate tissues After sex the pinkish discharge could be your bodys attempt to recover from the chaffing  Also your vagina is more susceptible to overgrowth infection of naturally occurring organisms yeast gardnerella etc when it is dry I would see a doctor before attempting self treatment for any sort of vaginosis and she could prescribe or suggest treatment for the dryness Good Luck Missing your period is certainly a big red flag I would go see a doctor andor take a pregnancy test  I wouldnt eait while your stomach is upset But make sure to drink fluids because you could get dehydrated If youve been vomitting for a little while you might consider taking some meds to settle down your stomach Once your stomach has settled and you feel better start with very bland foods Try a clear broth soup crackers bread nothing too heavy If that stays down you can start eating other foods Feel better soon Hi No yes This sounds like some of the symptoms I experience before I have an IBS irritable bowel syndrome attack my ability to regulate my body temp is poor I cramp I feel nauseous or faint and sometimes have loose or painful bowel movements If you dont have a history of IBS perhaps this is your bodys response to anal penetrationI know I feel a bit logy the few times after Ive done it Is this your first time taking birth control and did you have a period during the first month of your pills When in your cycle did you have unprotected sex If it wasnt in the first month first pack of your pills it seems unlikely that you are pregnant since most pills provide contraceptive protection after the first month If you jumped from one pill pack into another ie skipping to avoid a period this can play with your cycle a bit I would contact a physician but if you didnt have unprotected sex in the first three weeks of your first pill pack pregnancy is unlikely Is it possible you could be pregnant I dont want to freak you out but it is a definite possible sign of miscarriage I just went through one  It takes about a month for bc to take full effect in your system so yes you could be Thank you first of all And yes it felt almost like period cramps only one sided and across my back I get back cramps anyways but I knew I was pregnant Most women who miscarry early on have no idea they just think it was a late period if you start having any tissue like clots come out then you are having a miscarriage but theres no real way to tell if you didnt know you were pregnant hun It could just be a late weird period I hope so Could be some sort of allergic reaction Are there similarities in the foods he cancant keep down Kidney stones  if gte mso 9xml wWordDocument wZoom0wZoom

headache It becomes nearly unbearable I have stopped taking the Novolog and within 24 hours or so it goes away I also get extreme weakness shakiness and extreme pain in my spine This is not a listed side effect My doctors have not heard of this side effect nor do they know what could be causing it The only thing I have found is that people with MS and Type 1 I have not been diagnosed with MS and I have Type 2 sometimes get neck pain but it did not explain why Im not sure my doctors actually believe this is happening I also had the same experience when taking Humolog Lantus and Levemir By the way the Lantus and Levemir increased my blood sugar levels I have sensitivity to many medications and often get the opposite effects from what is expected I cannot function from these side effects and I am concerned about not taking the medication I also experience nausea Has your mother experienced anything like this EndFragment For now you can continue and try not to take any other medications But if still not controlled you can take Ondensteron tablet 10mg before taking alpha lipoic acid I found this information in an article  on the symptoms of heart burn Many people have different acid refluxrelated heartburn triggers but most people have similar heartburn symptoms A burning feeling in the chest just behind the breastbone that occurs after eating and lasts a few minutes to several hours Chest pain especially after bending over lying down or eating Burning in the throat  or hot sour acidic or saltytasting fluid at the back of the throat Difficulty swallowing Feeling of food sticking in the middle of the chest or throat Heartburn may cause chronic cough sore throat or chronic hoarseness Reporting these symptoms is usually all that is needed for your doctor to make the diagnosis of heartburn However your doctor may perform special tests to determine the severity of your problem or to monitor your treatment Special tests may also be needed if you have unusual symptoms such as weight loss or suffer from the complications of GERD  httpwwwwebmdcomheartburngerdguideheartburnsymptoms I hope this helps Sounds like typical diarrhea to me You should maybe revel in the fact that its just once a year You might want to try and think through what you ate or drank when this happened in the past and stay away from those things If it totally makes you sad you should talk to your doctor When I was a kid and we would go deep sea fishing we used to use seabands which were like bracelets that hit a certain pressure point and prevented sea sickness I would try this before ingesting anything  especially considering that you are on medications well im not a dr but theres not always symtoms to liver damage I have stage 4 liver damage n I feel fine the only true test is a biopsy talk with your dr Ask your doctor about Lexapro taken daily It has helped me to deal with the chronic anxietystress and depression from Crohns and its effect on me physically and socially no Maybe its Gastritis yes I had gastritis and an ulcer and that was a symptom Depending on how heavy the flow was If it was really heavymoderatenormal for you and reddark red then it was your period If it was light and pinkbrown you couldve been spotting Get a home pregnancy test to make sure You could have a Urinary Tract Infection If it burns when you pee you feel like you have to pee but you cantvery little urine comes out kidney pains fever and cloudysmelly urine then you could have a UTI Check with a doctor before it becomes too serious you may have a rib out u could just need your back popped Its never a good idea to stack your packs I would try a different brand of birth control pills something with higher hormones in them Another idea is to try a different form of birth control such as the patch IUD Depo shotI personally didnt like the Depo shot because I had alot of break through bleeding and more pregnancy symptoms then when i was actually pregnant with my sons Your period is a natural thing that shouldnt be avoided It can be very unhealthy I would wait a few more days and see if you get your period If you cant wait then get an early response test The further from your period due date the less certain your results will be Try waiting to test at the most 2 days before your expected period The date that you had sex is around when you probably ovulated so you could be pregnant Only time will tell good luck If you had unprotected sex it would be good to still take a pregnancy test Some women still have periods or bleeding after getting pregnant If you are not pregnant check with you doctor on what could be causing your spotting Anything thats not normal for you should be checked out I am not sure what this is but it sounds serious It appears that you have taken your son to the doctor already to get some answers and that they have ruled out several things Talk to your doctor again as you need to get to the bottom of his health problems If you feel your doctor isnt taking this seriously you could try another one Ask for a recommendation from family and friends and make sure you have copies of his records and test results Trust your instincts If you feel something is wrong then find someone who is willing to help you may be and I hate to sound like a prune but it could be an STI either that or it could be BV bacterial vaginosis I had that took a pill and everything cleared up Best too get it checked  you could be pregnant or ur getting sick with something go see a doctor You may want to take another test and also see your doctor Yes this is very normal I believe When i was pregnant I had this same problem and the only thing that worked for me was to drink a glass of cold water and to eat a small amount of mustard If you are worried you could always see your doctor for a urine or blood pregnancy test that would tell you for absolute certain i hope she is old enough but she can be pregnant and if she is not then it can only mean one thing she sick and need medical attention immediately it can be an appendix bursting or it can be kidney failure if i were you id take her to ER now yes they do so that way if u are they can help u out alot better I have had many bladder infections in my life and one time i let one go and slacked on taking my meds my dr prescribed me and it ended up turing into a kindey infection Which cause horrible lower back pain and pains in my abdomen I would look into that  I was pregnant with my third daugther and was pregnant for 3 months I dont know what to tell you Go to the doctor Yes Well first make sure the place did not mess up your prescription only thing I could thinkis puberty It could be your pancrease Weakness should be excepted in an 84 year old woman after having a bout with nausea It could have indeed been a virus or bug even though there was no vomitting The best thing to do is to consult a doctor I dont smoke so smoking really isnt a factor here In addition I tend to eat very healthy lots of veggies and nearly every meal is homecooked there is no fast food in my diet or overly sugary products Yes it is the result of plan b I took it once and i had the same effects as you did and got my period a week later due to the pill that disintegrated the egg The plan b box has the side effects as well Get tested Get some professional help They dx and prescribe meds if needed See a psychiatrist and a good counselor Good Luck go see your doctor could be generalized anxiety or vertigo or you could be dehydrated abnormal blood pressure can also present this way I could go on these type symptons can be indicators of many things see a physician get a check up and get some blood drawn You should make an appt with your dentist since the wisdom tooth may be impactedif other symptoms persist then see your pcp Ive used mouth wash before also I also get a choking feeling and sometimes throw up a bit  its pretty often too I think its normal It probably happens because the mouth wash is too close to your throat in ur mouth So yeah lols no Yes you can have a rise in temperature as your body is trying to cope with it but it just cant quite do it so yes there will be a rise drink lots of water and if gets worse i would immediately go up to the emergency cause if you are to dehydrated and can make you not very well and they can put a drip in and give you fluids Test again and if its still negative go get checked out could be stress causing it or something else Id go see Dr Phil jk I wouldnt worry about it most likely you tore tissue in your rectum from masturbation as it appears to have been your first time Dont stress about it since it only happened once and was a little bit of blood and some people have phobias to that such as myself Maybe get some ky jelly or lube before you try again   Call your Doctor other than pills several people go see charapractor sorry if it wrong spelling with getting their back popped n massage after a few visit it seem to go away i have chronic migraines for 5 years now and nothing helps me  so far try that to see if it works a doctor had told me for what he does with his paitents instead

pregnancy like symptoms can occur without actually being pregnant they are rare Kuddos to you for being prepared before having sex Oh and nausea might be caused by one of your medications or even the

if you just do that many a month you may be okay But you need to talk to your doctor Hope you find the right thing and get better I think one of the most frustrating things in the field of medicine is the overall feeling by Physicians that all patients are created equal They consistently confuse the patient rights with the Bill of Rights oh but if they would only learn I started a few years ago to be my strongest most vocal most knowledgeable most interested advocate of them all when it came to my health care It is my body my mind and nobody I mean nobody knows it nor should they better than I If I can go to an appt prepared with questions about what I think might be wrong and have a discussion I feel alot better than it being a crap shoot Two years ago if it hadnt been for me and Web MD I swear my doctor would have killed me If you cant take the medication with throwing up switch doctors if he is new doctor provide previous records If he wont listen to reason report him If you are on the up and up about NOT being able to take the Tylonol then you are allergic and the answer of  because thats the way we do it is not treating the patient under the oath that doctor has taken So you have to make a choice Take the meds he gives you change doctors or you can report to the States Insurance Comm for not providing adequate care file it and see what happens If youre abusing the opiates and he knows itwell then you answered your own question quite honestly I worked for a pain mgt physician in Daytona Beach some years back and I got to know the patients very well I liked them alot but my eyes were not Eyes Wide Shut If he has your current records if he is a new doctor with those and learning more about who you are as a patient and a person he may come around I have doctor do that to me even with something like nausea meds I was told what I was taking was making me to sleepy I had been taking it for several years it had yet ever to make me sleepy I told the doctor drugs like this that are suppose to have that affect dont on me their fine She didnt prescribe them gave me another drug that didnt work and made me sick to my stomach and I told her that nicely but it was true Listen to your patients Best of luck to you and I hope you can somebody who will work with you mental lower back pain and front left pelvic area painIn the mornings hard to stand and walk urinating uncontrolled  neck pain leftsideafter walking around pain is lessbut not gonehard to stand up every morning drinking water it go right threw Icant make it to the bathroomwithout urine running down my legs Doctors have many medications these days for nausea I was nauseous all day for 9 months I need to go to the doctor a few times to get fluids also Call your doctor they can help with that It is not fun I know exactly how you are feeling Some things I did was have crackers by my bed and ate a few before I sat up in bed and then slowly sit up Also one of those rice packs you can heat up in the microwave and lay it on your stomach Use an alcohol swab pad and smell it for a few minutes ginger tea a couple cups of mint tea with honey and sugar I hope you feel better I would get checked ITs still possible to get pregnant Antibiotics are great for getting rid of infections but they also get rid of good bacteria in your stomach Probiotics replace that good bacteria Even though I am not a doctor I took antibiotics for almost 2 years and it has helped me greatly to take a daily probiotic I am feeling good thats very true i had my period for 4 months with my son and if it wasent for someone asking me if i was prego  which was kinda weird for me since i was 95 lbs  something made me take the test and i was already 8 weeks didnt have a clue  It could be your gallbladder If you still have your gallbladder speak to your physician about your symptoms He should be able set you up with a HIDA scan to see if that is what is causing your discomfort I also recommend seeing your doctor Those symptoms can come from a number of different things from GERD to Sleep apnea to Anemia Your best bet is getting a doctors opinion  Yes it is possible and not uncommon If you keep doing this month There are many reasons why you could have stomach pain after eating and nausea Some diagnosis are serious and need medical attention right away I would schedule an appointment with your doctor ASAP Be prepared with a complete list of symptoms and see if you can identify potential triggers ie certain foods beverages time of day frequency duration etc The more information you can provide your doctor up front the faster he might be able to give you a diagnosis and treatment Im wondering why this appears under Ulcer Have you been diagnosed with Ulcers before It stands for Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis or NSF Now it many mean something entirely different to your doctor Have you been diagnosed with this Youre most likely dehydrated Make sure you drink plenty of water Nothing with caffeine no coffee tea soda I have had ever test there is upper gi ct scan and colonoscopy everything is normal next step is the nervo team thats why Im lost on whats wrong with me If you have not seen your doctor yet particularly one that is trained in concussions as most primary care physicians are not you need to right away A concussion is swelling of the brain Getting a 2nd concussion when still symptomatic from the first concussion is incredibly dangerous and can lead to very severe consequences such as permanent brain damage I cannot stress enough the importance of going to your doctor RIGHT AWAY no With blood present an imbalance of hormones could be the problem I experienced something along those lines without the added pain My doctor told me to get in to see her asap  no one should experience blood during menopause An adjustment of my prescription hormone therapy was diagnosed The symptoms also resemble gallbladder kidney or bladder stones however these should have already been ruled out with a CAT Scan My mother diabetic experienced something as that which lasted quiet awhile she lost a significant amount of weight during her sickness Doctors were also stunned and diagnosed something as gastritis Researching the web of her symptomsI found that she was probably experiencing an inflammation of the outer lining of her stomach She was given antibiotics from her doctor which was appropriate however I advised a change in diet until better Her symptoms lasted for several months The nausea prevented her from eating as she should resulting in a unhealthy weak appearance There was significant sporadic work loss during that time Antibiotics were prescribed at least twice as I remember The one thing I have learned of the medical field is that they are forever making mistakes and usually it is good to rely on your own thoughts and those of family and friends Never ever hesitate to get a second or third opinion If your doctor is located in a small town seek out a professional in the closest large city as the state capital or one of its size It seems the most knowledgeable and creative doctors practice in larger cities One last thought Not knowing more information the thought of an appendix problem popped to mind I agree about the effects of smoking It will be better if you quit smoking and embrace a healthier lifestyle You should always be mindful in choosing the kinds of foods that you have to take in so you can stay in shape You may also try Coolsculpting or check out wwwbodytreatmentcentercom I also experience pain like yours cant find the reason for it as well after a lot of different scans blood tests etc very frustating I have been to a gastroligist and diagnosed me with IBS have been on a FODMAPS eating plan and have found some help with the pain gluten seems to be one of the culprits together with lactose look up FODMAPS you will find a lot of information It seems strange but too many fruit and vegetables can actually cause the pain You could give it a try It is like your body has an intolerance to specific foods its finding out what food your body has a problem with The severity of my pain was nine out of ten doubled up severe pain it is hard to believe food can cause so much extreme pain I still have pain attacks but not nearly as often as I use to but gluten in particular can be found in cough lollies yogurt ice cream and other foods that you would never guess has gluten in them This is only a suggestion it has helped me I had a close friend who had same problem with her son who at time was 3 years old now 5 years old I told her to give him Lactose and Glucotin free foods stop all daily vitamins he might be taking Pedlite that first thing in the morning small 4oz to start with Decrease all spices in his food to almost none No fried food at all If you go to your grocery market get the Gerber Graduates for him but dont let him see it cause hes a big boy not a baby and will not eat if he sees the baby food jar Best of luck to you and your son I had to raise my friends son for almost 2 years cause she couldnt handle him being in pain with or without food So me being in medical field and having 5 medical degrees didnt mind hes all better now and back with his momma now Those may very well be side effects to the shot It would be a good idea to see your doctor to see what you can do I am also on the shot but never experienced those side effects Hope that helped it may be your body trying to regulate its self i would wait a week and than take another test if that comes back negative and still no sign of your period i would see your doctor for a blood test You might be stressed especially worrying over whether or not you are pregnant Are your periods always regular Try not thinking about it If you dont get your period within a week or if you need to settle your mind go buy a pregnancy test I dont know which one would be better Just go to the store look and pick the one that works best for you Sounds like postnasal drip You either have a virus or its allergies Think of it like a runny nose that drips down your throat Can be pretty discomforting to the stomach as well some medications like proton pump inhibitors can cause an increased heart rate though It is a possibility If I were you I would take a pregnancy test just to make sure then make an appointment with your medical doctor regardless of the results my daughter had a feeding tube for almost 2 years because she refused to eat 90 of the time when she would get sick is if the food was going into her belly too fast maybe if you try slowing down feedings and give less more often it could help that way the body has to work less hard to try to digest what is going inso instead of say 20 oz in 5 mins every hr try 10 oz every 10 mins every hour and a half his symptoms were exactly the same then as they are nowjust no real improvement since being on the antibiotic I am no doctor but I recently got a concussion I am 15 years old so we are most likely similar in age Let me tell you about my concussion I got hit in the head with a giant flag during marching band and it did hurt very bad I kept playing though until the show was done After that I immediately knew something was wrong because all of a sudden it was hard to walk and I had a big headache and I went to find my parents I couldnt walk straight and it was very difficult but we went to the ER and They did tests on me I followed the doctors hand and it was hard I had to touch certain places that the doctors moved his hand to and that was extremely difficult I was diagnosed with a concussion Now you may have one too I suggest getting checked out by a doctor but that is just my experience with a concussion I dont know which it is but I can tell you that it is illadvised to take pepto if you are pregnant It can be very serious and gastroenteritis lasting more than a week really should be assessed by a physician Most food poisoning will resolve in a HEALTHY adult within a week If you go more than that you run the risk of throwing off electrolytes your body minerals salt potassium magnesium and so on You can suffer some cardiac events without the proper balance of minerals If you have bloody diarrhea this should always be assessed by physician Blood in vomit could indicate an ulcer bowel movement with coffee grind look indicates digested bloodulcer or intestinal bleed Even though you were on low dose you may need to dose down from Amitriptiline I took low dose for about 3 months several years ago and I did dose myself down Just spread out your doses Add an extra hour or two or take when symptoms begin and spread it out farther and farther until you can stop I dont know for sure but i have GERD and it causes my heart rate elevate The samething happens to me it could be GERD as far as nausea but i still havent figured out why the headaches u mentioned so less symptomsanyhow with such possibilities cholecystitis is quite possible Yes many woman spot when they are first pregnant Best action to take is get tested to see if you are pregnant Perhaps going to a doctor to have this done would be best as they can also advise you on the bleeding or spotting while you are there If you arent very far along I would suggest you ask for a blood test they are very accurate and can detect pregnancy very early on Yep you sure could be Missing birth control pills make you even more prone to become pregnant in a lot of women even if you bleed afterward That could be Zygote attachment to your uterine wall Good luck I am not an expert but I have a history of pain during intercourse mine was a severe case of endometreosis this is caused by scar tissue building up on our internal organs during our monthly cycle I would definitely check with your OBGYN doctor and they should hopefully be able to find what is causing this You are never suppose to take acetaminophen and aspirins together First of all acetaminophens not good for the heart liver or gastric problems such as acid reflux bowel problems and stomach problems Also aspirin low milligrams are all right for gastrology problems and good for the heart and liver Wellbutrin is a simple drug for anxieties and some depression but i would ask what is better to take with it Please do not take those 2 together Every time Ive ever been they have tested me for pregnancy because of things like xrays and certain medications They also need to know in case you need a blood transfusion or other specific procedures yes you can but when i was on the pill i had the same symtoms and more symtoms that you also can get while pregnant but i was not pregnant The pill causes the symtoms you desrcibed but if you still think you could be pregnant taking a test is the only real way to be sure You may be pregnant Ive been reading a lot since I am 3 days late and it sounds like it could be implantation bleeding which is usually very light pink or spotting some people describe it as a light period andor shorter period than normal You can test since youre almost a week late Mine are all coming out negative but I feel pregnant Good luck It may be that you are pregnant Feeling nausea  since she is diabetic you have to rule out hypoglycemic headace get a GRBS tested if GRBS is less than 60 mg ask her to take some sugar or candy treatment for gastritis can also be given A neck xray can rule out cervical spondilitis Maybe you shouldnt push ur toothbrush to the back of your throat Brush your tongue not your tonsils You may be pregnant You shold get a pregnancy test from a store or go see a doctor ASAP Yes those symptoms may not be coincidental However you might need to wait a little longer to see if you are HIV positive Test results may be incorrect if youre tested too soon They have a test where they prick your finger just like a diabetes test Its completely painless and it takes 15 minutes They test for HIV antibodies and thats why you might need to wait a little longer to test If you have an outreach center near you they offer tests for free Also was the rash white Thats a common thing for HIV Flu symptoms are a common indicator Its certainly possible The best way is to see if that person you had an interaction with 100 is infected Bring himher to a test center Even if its negative heshe could still be a carrier Its scary but you can definitely get it under control If you feel extremely off and in danger visit the ER just in case its something else I agree with who gave you the answer And like her Im also on it and I think its the best thing in the world No more periods not even spotting and not even one typical period symptom Sorry about your problems with the DEPO I agree with going to talk to your doctor Everybody is different keep that in mind it could just be symptoms of your period my son has ha several concussion at least 5 From car wreck dr says they were mild but now he seems conused at lot like his memory comes and goes and he sometimes loose track of year and time "}
