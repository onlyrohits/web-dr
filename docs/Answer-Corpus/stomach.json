stools especially in large quantities Be carefull to wash your greens by swishing them in mildly soapy water or vege wash then rinse as chemicals sprayed on these crops can cause the same problem I have had gerd and it has never caused increased heart rate I think you should have your heart checked asap It could be heart trouble so consider calling a ambulance to the nearest emergency room It is better to be safe than worry about looking foolish Too many people die because of that reason yes thats what i like to know get checked out Was the head removed Thinkdid the front of the tick between its front legs have a drop of bloodliguid visible after removal Was the tick at all actively flailing its legstrying to move As opposed to a piece of you attached to it resembling a small blood blot and a highly active tick IF RECENTLY ATTACHED Indocin is a strong antiinflammatory usually given for Gout Do you take any other medicine for migraines Vicodin Tylenol Aspirin Advil Motrin Aleve Excedrin All of these medications can cause elevations in liver enzyme levels if taken for long period of time Do you drink alcohol as well Is your pain located below your right rib cage and do you have a yellowish tint to your eyes or skin That can indicate liver damage Did the Dr draw a AST  ALT LEVEL on you I suggest if any of the above questions are yes get redrawn blood labs  Abdominal Ultrasound to check for enlarged liverdamage Sometimes during an endoscopy the insertion of the tube down the back of your throat can cause irritation and slight bleeding Thats normal from the procedure If it gets heavier you develop a fever have stomach pain and vomit blood see your Dr on Monday or if vomiting blood go to the ER ER with a fever too Call your GI DR Monday morning If you have missed your period then you should take a home pregnancy test Make sure to follow all of the directions on the box or you could get false results I was on Chantix and I did not have all these symptoms but I did get sick to my stomach and had horrible nightmares and bad mood swings I quite on day 8 of taking it and have been clean for two years I learned that drinking milk before I went to bed would make the nightmares go away and it also helped me with the stomach pains through out the day as for the mood swings I warned people to stay away I understand what your going through not sure the cause because I have not yet visited a doctor im seventeen and just got married but also have not had a period since may 2013 and its now November 2013 this may not help but you know your not alone And Im not pregnant If your a female it sounds like the first signs of pregnancy If your a male it could be indigestion Although you may sleep better knowing your baby is sleeping on her back once children roll from supine to prone back to belly there is no controlling sleep position through the night Although there is no harm and possibly some psychological benefit for you in flipping her back onto her back you should not feel like you need to do this I assume your daughter can easily clear her airway in prone and I also assume she will very soon roll from belly to back You can discuss changing her to a methylphenidate medication since these have lower risks of stomach ache Or you could explore Vyvanse which is similar to Adderall but has a different delivery system If you are reluctant to change meds one alternative to discuss with your physician would be to split the Adderall dose  give half the capsule and then 2030 minutes later give the other half If you sprinkle the med into food do not let the second half of the dosage sit in the food for the 30 minutes since the beads will dissolve prematurely The pain has been on my left side just about 2 fingers under my rib cage what is causing this pain My mom and sister went through the same thing My mom is 50 and has had a tubal since 1987 She discovered she was suffering from severe endometriosis She had an oblasion done and has never had another issue My sister is 29 and last year she looked like she was 9 months pregnant She has had her tubes tied since March 2008 She found she had endometriosis as well as tumors They performed a hystorectomy and she has not had anymore issues so far Just a thought Probably have no energy because you are dehydrated from the increased loss of fluid even tho you are drinking it may very well not be enough The blood may be caused from the increased amount of defecation causing irritation in the bowel The first thing that comes to my mind is Cholecystitis gallbladder inflammation andor stones I have been an RN for over 20 years and have had this condition myself and it was necessary to have my gall bladder removed The symptoms that you describe is exactly what I experienced to a T A total gall bladder work up was suggested on my behalf and surgery was required A visit to your physician is must assuredly suggested and questions related to the gall bladder and even the pancreas should be explored NO Sure you could have depression or anxiety Ask many doctors what brought most patients into their office for treatment and theyll tell you that its stress driven It doesnt matter if it is a cold or hypertension or some other malady it is a fact that our bodies process emotional stress through negative physical complaints It does not mean that you are behaving strangely it just means that you are human and living in a faced paced society in 2014 So what action do you take After all it is not normal to feel the way that you feel and dangerous to your overall health Here are my suggestions Discuss the symptoms listed in your posting with a family doctor Have a complete physical examination to ruleout physical disease Eat a healthy diet and engage in regular exercise as permitted by your doctor Enroll in a yoga class or stress reduction class Secure some close friendships to share your feelings Enroll in a volunteer activity Enroll in a fun class like dancing to meet new people to learn something new and to occupy your spare time Listen to music of your choosing Surround yourself with positive people Take a nice vacation Drink plenty of water If all else fails do not hesitate to meet with a professional counselor or visit a stress reduction support group Medications may also help but are usually not necessary and should be a means of last resort  Your reaction to finding lump in your breast is completely understandable and normal I believe that your anxiety is really fear Anxiety and fear are interrelated conditions Anxiety causes fear and fear causes anxiety But there are differences Anxiety is a common emotion that is usually due to some vague feeling of apprehension without an obvious threat An example might be walking down a dark street alone at night and feeling afraid Fear on the other hand is an emotional response to a definite threat For example someone approaches you on that same dark street and says Stick them up Now you have a real threat and are justifiability fearful That lump in your breast was a real threat and must be considered as a legitimate fear Once that fear is totally removed your anxious feelings should subside Until you get a clean bill of health from your 2nd opinion physician please attempt to direct your focus on the results of your first opinion Enjoy life enjoy your family and have fun I hope that your wait to hear positive news this week is swift and that your emotional health is instantly restored The confusion is understandable and is best resolved by following your doctors instructions In the USA weve never become quite comfortable with the metric system The liquid form of B12 should note how many mgs  ml on the label 1cc s 1 ml s 1000 mg The gram is the metric unit used in weight while the liter is used for liquid measure One 10 mg s 1000 mcg The typical recommended daily allowance of a B12 tablet for a healthy adult is about 23 mcg daily The normal dosage of a sublingual B12 tablet for a post surgical gastric bypass patient is 05 mg A dose of 5mg as shown in your question would seem more than adequate To complicate things even more B12 is available in tablets capsules nasally injectable sublingual tablets drops and even in patch administration There is also a B12 complex variety The liquid form can be found in various flavors The short answer is yes The federal government realizes that gastric bypass surgery actually saves Medicare money in the long run How is that possible Heres the answer Conditions such as diabetes severe arthritis high blood pressure and sleep apnea are may improve after surgery or even be totally eliminated The short answer is yes I bet that someone somewhere is allergic to almost every food product or their individual ingredients The human body can sometimes be very unpredictable It may quickly reject food through the process of allergic reactions Some folks will outgrow allergies while some folks will suddenly go through an allergic reaction after having ingested a food product for many years in an uneventful manner As a matter of interest I just recently returned from a same day medical clinic because I had experienced a systemic itch for the past three days The doctor diagnosed my itching to my taking an antibiotic called Bactrim The odd think to me was that I had no allergic symptoms during the first 5 days of taking this medicine Powered sugar is also known as confectioners sugar sugar frosting icing sugar and 10X or 4X sugar If you ever run out of powdered sugar and need a quick replacement try this recipeCombine 4 cups of granulated white sugar and  cup of cornstarch Mix in a food processor until blended completely into a powdery substance Yes foods that we eat can cause black tarry stools But chocolate donuts cookies dont sound like the cause Thinks like black licorice pepto bismuth blueberries and iron supplements are more likely suspects for sources of ingested products causing the blacktarry colorThe diarrhea and feeling light headed can go along with the stomach bug Ibuprofen can be harsh to the digestive tract and might cause some internal bleeding But the shortness of breath is a disturbing symptom when combined with feeling lightheaded and having blacktarry diarrhea This could be a sign of a more significant medical problem and even a medical emergency Conditions such as ulcers gastritis hemorrhoids a stomach tear called MalloryWeiss usually caused by violent coughing and some types of cancer are legitimate medical concerns I recommend that you go to the emergency room of a nearby hospital to ruleout any type of internal bleeding that could change from minimal to massive quickly Be prepared for possible testing including barium studies xrays rectal exam stool specimen culture and a colonoscopy As you can see by this answer many possible causes may be the reason for your present medical condition It is virtually impossible to diagnosis the exact cause of your problem through only your question on this web site Since the possibility does exist no matter how remote that you may be in a serious medical crisis please go the hospital dont hesitate to call 911 where trained medical personnel and testing equipment are available I am sorry for your dads serious condition After 2 weeks of not eating or drinking a person would be close to death The human body when bedridden  where energy is barely being expended  can survive a maximum of 8 14 days without fluid intake  The hospital would have had a responsibility to treat your dad and stabilize him before discharging him from the ER Was he given IV fluids at the ER What instructions were provided by the ER prior to his discharge It would be interesting to know if your dad refused treatment Nutrition is a part of required medical treatment that must be provided by the hospitalBut the patient may refuse medications food and fluids just like any other medical treatments Unfortunatelywithout intervening with fluids almost immediately the body will shut down and death will soon occur I wish you well during this period of uncertainty Your bowel habits have changed but do not seem to be out of what is considered to be normal activity A bowel movement occurring 3 xs per day or 3xs per week is perfectly normal for many people The positive news is that I did not see any reporting of stool color changes excessively fowl odors or changes in shape or texture Here are some common sense suggestions to establish a regular schedule of healthy stool elimination  Eat plenty of healthy fruits and vegetables  Add sufficient bulk to your diet  Stay well hydrated as up to 75 of stool is water  Maintain a regular exercise program  Avoid chemical sweeteners caffeine and chemical additives Bowel movement frequency may change over time without any obvious reasons or negative consequences As we age it is important to inspect the products resulting from stool elimination have regular rectal examsa colonoscopy performed at the age of 50 years old and be examined by a GI doctor every year or so Its can be tough diagnosing an itchy body Hives are red itchy welts on the skin and may be caused by various allergic agents and even nervous conditions Treatment of hives is directed at removing the source of the offending source I had a generalized body itch took the same course of action as you and eventually broke down and was seen in a walkin medical clinic for professional help My symptoms were mostly limited to feeling itchy from head to toe with only a faint trace of a skin rash I though that I had considered all possible causes including bug bites and new products entering my body such as foods beverages soaps and medications I also noted that my wife who shared our common bed was free of the same symptoms Obviously I was not contagious In my situation the hives condition was caused by an oral antbiotic that I had already taken for 5 days Since I had previously taken this same anti biotic in the past without negative consequences and didnt immediately see a reaction to the current treatment regime I mistakenly excluded the antibiotic as my allergic source In my case I was given an injectable dose of corticosteroid prescribed Prednisone and directed to terminate the offending antbiotic In your case after 34 days without resolving the issue through hydro cortisone and antihistamines its probably time to see a doctor  I am sorry for your mothers liver disease Having her stomach pumped suggests that fluid is backing up and that the cirrhosis has existed for some length of time Based upon the information provided with your question her individual survival rate is unpredictable But I will supply you with some raw data that may be useful Cirrhosis is progressive with no known cure But the condition may be best treated by preventing further liver damage The five 5 year survival rate for liver cirrhosis is approximately 60 percent The flip side is that 40 out of 100 individuals after being diagnosed will not be living 5 years later It has been reported that anywhere from 1520 years of life is prematurely lost due to cirrhosis of the liver Early detection and treatment can improve on the prognosis for cirrhosis If cirrhosis is diagnosed during its early stage a suitable candidate may qualify to have a liver transplant Consuming a healthy diet managing complications of the disease as they may arise and reducing the livers workload through elimination of certain medications and alcohol can extend the quantity of living years and the overall quality of life Take care of your mom yourself and your family during this time of uncertainty  The Whipple procedure  named for a 1920s physician surgically treats pancreatic cancer by eliminating the head and sometimes the body of the pancreas Also removed is usually part of the stomach the small intestine and lymph nodes in the vicinity of the pancreas The gallbladder and common bile duct are also typically removed This operation is now a common treatment for endocrine cancer of the pancreas The 5 year survival rate for pancreatic cancer is a dismal 5 After employing the Whipple procedure  the 5 year survival rate increases to about 20 This surgery in many cases does not always resolve the cancer completely Although visible signs may indicate complete removal of the pancreatic cancer through the Whipple Procedure  some cancerous cells may have already affected other nearby structures It seems like this is the case for your father Over time these cancerous cells grow into tumors that can threaten life The return of the cancer to the pancreas andor other organs is to be expected even when all cancer of the pancreas seemed to have been eliminated with the Whipple Procedure  At this point of time the prognosis must be considered as very guarded Survival is based upon the stage of cancer development  available treatment options and the patients overall health I am not sure of the viability in your fathers situation but some positive results have been produced by Cold Laser Therapy I recommend that the doctor be questioned on why the treatment modality is being confined to only chemotherapy Determine if the treatment option being offered is only palliative and not really curative in nature Ask directly about the prognosis and odds for survival These questions deserve honest answers If necessary seek out a second medical opinion I wish your father and his family peace during this

questions deserve honest answers If necessary seek out a second medical opinion I wish your father and his family peace during this challenging period of time Receiving a verbal report from the doctor of having an enlarged stomach in and by itself is of little help to the patient You deserve an explanation for the significance of this observation Some questions to be answered may include What does that finding indicate for me What caused my enlarged stomach What treatments if any are avaliable What is the normal course to be followed in treating my enlarged stomach What is the prognosis for my condition An enlarged stomach can be caused by various reasons including excessive body fat accumulation fluid accumulation within the abdominal cavity and many gastrointestinial conditions Treatment is dependent on the cause determined through the diagnosis process Since underlying medical conditions can be responsible for an enlarged stomach it is advised to followup with the GI doctor to learn the exact significance of it for you The short answer is yes Its probably not harmful in the strict sense of the word but does adversely affect digestion Ive seen enough articles on drinking fluids while eating to form the opinion that the practice does dilute gastric acid in the stomach and interferes with the digestive process Drinking fluids with meals is a controversial issue Some proponents suggest that drinking while eating clearly aids in the digestive process and helps individuals to feel fuller quicker The objectors to drinking while eating seem to be in the majority  They cite the fact that digestion actually begins in the mouth with saliva softening food It is concurred that the saliva is diluted by the fluids and adversely affects digestion They also point out that fluid in the stomach while eating will dilute gastric juices that are instrumental to the digestion process A point of informationalthough limited to a particular group of individuals should be injected into the conversation That is that its common practice by bariatric surgeons for whatever reason to have their bariatric patients refrain from drinking while eating The short answer is yes Its probably not

with any degree of scientific certainty As a matter of fact some studies have concluded that duodenal ulcers may actually protect an individual from stomach cancer Peptic ulcer development on the other hand has some of the same risk factors that are seen with stomach cancer What is known i s that a bacterial strain called HPylori can settle in the stomach cause inflammation ulcers and lead to stomach cancer In conclusion No causal relationship between stomach cancer and ulcers has been proven  Hi your moms oncologist is in the best position to assess the dos and donts while receiving cancer treatment Is she receiving radiation or chemotherapy Typically using hair coloring products while receiving chemotherapy is discouraged by the medical experts Based upon my research hair coloring should not be done until 612 months after stopping chemotherapy and then only by using an allnatural plant based dye A similar question was asked on WebMD three years ago and received 30 responses The link to the question and its responses was inserted below this answer I hope that you find these anecdotal accountings helpful httpforumswebmdcom3breastcancerexchangeforum15613 There is a product called Pure Henna I have no interest in this hair treatment but do care about cancer patients It is made from a plant called Henna that is used to make some medicines including hair coloring

and tastes various medical conditions and other reasons Obviously your system for whatever reason is finding Mirapex to be objectionable Perhaps it is its active ingredient causing you the discomfort Mirapex contains pramipexole as its active ingredient This is a dopamine agonist and is approved for the treatment of restless leg syndrome One study reported that 650 of Mirapex users experienced nausea as a negative side effect to pramipexole Praamipexole seems to disproportionally target women over 50 years of age who have been taking this drug for less than 30 days with nausea With your

problems with the drainage system involving interactions occurring between the pancreas gallbladder and liver Bile salts are normally released by the liver If there is a liver disturbance bile production may be reduced or the release of bile can be blocked The bile chemicals may buildup in the body and result in gray colored stools Sometimes a yellowing of the skin is also a symptom observed in conjunction with clay colored stools Digestion of the peanut butter may or may not hold any significance in the development of your change in stool color I would recommend not waiting any longer for resolution Stools that are gray colored along with abdominal pain may be indicative of a liver infection or liver disease Anytime that stools are not brown in color is the right time to contact your doctor to have the situation correctly assessed Diagnosing your medical condition will require a through patient interview detailing past medical conditions confirming when symptoms first appeared family history age sex medications being taken pain quality describing your pain as burning after eating may suggest a gastric type of disturbance and a physical examination It can be a time consuming challenge to both you and your medical professional to eventually comeup with an accurate diagnosis One point to note is that some pain can be characterized as referred pain That is pain originating from one anatomical location but causing pain in another location A differential type of diagnosing technique may be employed and require more blood studies cardiac testing CT Scans Xrays and other testing Some common disturbances were addressed in the emergency room but a boatload of other possible medical conditions still remain Upper right abdominal pain can be caused by many medical conditions including Your symptoms will require the painstaking investigative work by a competent and methodical physician One by one all possible causes must be eliminated until only one remains  on your stoke recovery and smoking cessation I smoked 2 12 packs of cigarettes per day and made a conscious decision to stop before overt signs of lung or heart disease surfaced I read that a person who stops smoking at the age of 50 adds six years to their life expectancy People who quit smoking after having a heart attack reduce their chances of having another heart attack by 50 But with a history of smoking for 40 years lung and heart disease can still materialize even after years of abstinence For example I stopped smoking almost 30 years ago and thought that I was out of woods only to have been recently diagnosed with COPD Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and a rightsided heart block The great news is that you will have decreased by 50 after 10 years of nonsmoking your chances of succumbing to cancer of the mouth throat esophagus bladder cervix and pancreas Yes it is possible that you have emphysema Please make an appointment to be evaluated by your personal physician Chances are that he or she will request chest xrays blood work an EKG and other studies They may also refer you to a cardiologist pulmonologist gastroenterologist and other medical specialist for consultation Youve come so far and deserve an opportunity to lead a productive life After all youre only 50 years old and should have many good years in the future Please do not dismiss the shortness of breath and changes in the anatomical look of your stomach accompanied with distress I do not believe that a high serum LDL is related to your symptoms Were your blood sugar levels in range Besides pain high blood sugar levels are a common feature of this disease Acute pancreatitis claimed my brothers life at the age of 58 It is a serious disease that can be life threatening It is a horrible disease and can result in a painful death What was the cause of your acute pancreatitis It is crucial to know the original cause of your condition and that treatment had been and continues to be directed at that cause Causes may be attributable to chronic drinking of alcohol my brother rarely even drank a beer digestive conditions and sometimes heredity factors I recommend that you consult with a University Hospital Endocrinologist Specialist to receive the highest quality of treatment for diseases that may be related to the pancreases  Internet sites attribute no known cause for cancer of the appendix With that said my good sense tells me that there is a cause relationship involved between cancer of the appendix and the family I say that for several reasons Number one many other medical conditions have a proven inherited component Number two cancers of the appendix are very rare yet look how it has affected your family Thats more than just bad karma Number three on the general principle that I just dont usually buy into coincidences Cancers of the appendix are usually not discovered until an appendectomy is performed Signs of the disease may be abdominal pain bowel obstruction appendicitis and increase in abdomen size most likely due to fluid accumulation hernias or ovarian masses Roughly 1 out of every 300 appendectomy cases involved the removal of a cancerous appendix That equates to approximately 1 of all appendectomy specimens containing neoplastic cells Treatment for a cancerous appendix may involve its surgical removal along with adjacent areas of the colon Also available as options are chemotherapy and radiation Treatment decisions depend on when the cancer was discovered access to medical care the progression and spread of the growths and the age and overall health of the individual It was interesting to learn that many cancers found in the appendix actually originated in the colon but was not diagnosed until pain in the appendix region presented itself In those cases the patients diagnosis should have been colon cancer that metalized to the appendix and not appendix cancer You should not be experiencing hurting sensations in your sides or chest after two months of having experienced Dry Heaves Dry heaves is the sensation of feeling nauseous but being unable to vomit It may be the result of a nervous condition overindulgence of food or beverages morning sickness and many other reasons This disorder can be very uncomfortable but is usually only a temporary disturbance When the symptoms are not resolved on their own within a day a doctor should be consulted Some results from the retching can include brain pressure torn muscles rib trauma dehydration causing electrolyte imbalance aspiration of food into the lungs causing aspiration pneumonia and blood vessel ruptures A specific side effect observed with dry heaves is a condition called MalloryWeiss Tear This tear in the mucus membrane of the esophagus  may require emergency room treatment due to internal bleeding and possible inpatient hospitalization Ive given you some ideas but am not a doctor After two months of having uncomfortable feelings do not delay in making an appointment with your doctor This person has the medical training knowledge of your medical history can ask you questions and can perform diagnostic testing I have been taking 175 to 200 mcg every day for more than 30 years I think you were given accurate information on how to properly take Synthroid  It is solid advice to take Synthroid every morning at least one hour before eating  I been told by my personal physician and several endocrinologists that absorption of Synthroid can be decreased by roughly 20 when taken with food or shortly after a meal Some studies suggest that the time of day to take thyroid medication does not affect its efficacy Taking the medication on an empty stomach at the same time of day is the generally accepted recommendation by most medical authorities I have been taking 175 to 200 mcg every day for more than 30 years I think you were given accurate information on how to properly take Synthroid  It

spreads to other organs it is referred to as metastasis Therefore a cancer originating in the lungs and which has spread to the stomach is called  Sometimes it can be difficult to determine which original organ was first assaulted by cancer cells At times the metastasized cancer may actually be uncovered and treated before the primary organ where the cancer originated is discovered Treatment options are dependent on the number of tumors the stage of cancer development when discovered in the stomach and the overall general health of the patient Since the total areas where cancer has spread is unknown surgery for removal of the stomach is not the usual treatment preference More likely are chemotherapy alternatives that can systematically attack all of the cancer cells You got a serious problem you need to go see your doctor Next time you might dont be so luck Go see a doctor you need help I would take the baby in black could mean problem but the dirrhea lasting that long could be causing dehydration and that could lead to other problems The doctor can check the stool and take action if dehydration is really involved Yes If you havent been on probiotics you should Your immune

could be related to stress over fear of pregnancy  which due to the intensity of your anxiety might evoke a stress reaction other less intense stimuli dont  but it is also possible that they are related to something completely unrelated Stomach problems are rarely specific to any single illness or condition so a visit to your regular doctor might be in order Heshe could tell you conclusively if youre pregnant or not Im going to take a guess only a GUESS that youre not and point you in the right direction if anything still seems wrong If the pain stops when you get to school where you probably have plenty of things to distract you from it it is not unlikely that the discomfort is mental to some degree or at least minor enough to not be anything too serious Keep in mind there is a distinct possibility that your discomfort has absolutely nothing to do with your sexual experience at least not directly it might have been a coincidence that it happened to start around the same time so it wouldnt be unreasonable for you to have linked the two in your mind It might be related to your birth control assuming you just started it many people have stomach problems as a side effect to starting new medications A doctor can sometimes prescribe a different medicine for the same purposecondition as different medications even for the same condition can have different fewer or sometimes

through here is a website you can look at for that that they referred me too httpwwwcrohnsandcolitisinfocomcidppcppdgglcrohnsdaccinfonontvcrohn27sdiseasePhrase My nephew had dairy sensitivity and it cause these issues as well If she is an avid milk drinker I would consider lowering the fat content of the milk for a while for instance if you have her on whole milk go to 2 that kind of thing And limit her other dairy intake for a while butter yogurt cheese etcif it helps some just by reducing these things then you know its a dairy issue and i would switch her to soy milk rice milk or something of the sort and stop the cheese alltogether believe it or not not enough water in her diet can cause these issues as well they could be anything from sever pain to constipation or a mixture of the two I have had this issue myself the correct amount of water to have is 8 8oz glasses in a 24 hour period if you cant get her to drink it dry using the new koolaid liquid drink mixers or crystal light something of the sort just be sure whatever you mix with the water does not contain aspartame as this is poisonous for the human body if given too much over a long period of time last but not least too many fresh fruits and veggies can cause severe gas build up which can lead to pain and constipation as well try sticking to the food guide pyramid with this though you can look it up online to suit her age and weight and everything as to how much she should have These are all from personal experience or from close friends and family that have had these issues I hope this helps This is a very interesting question There are several factors that determine how long it takes for food to pass through your digestive system To start the type of food matters Some foods are more complex requiring our body to work harder and to take more time to break them down and digest them On the other hand other foods wont have to go through such a rigorous process and may be digested and metabolized relatively quickly Fiber for example has a decreased intestinal transit time which means that it spends less time in your intestines and may be passed through faster than something else The answer also could depend on other factors like age ethnicity and gender You have to consider that peoples digestive systems can be different or work in slightly different ways Did you know that some people have longer intestines than other people Certainly that might influence how long it takes for food to digest Also individuals may have different levels of microbes present in their intestines that can influence how food is digested too How long it takes food to digest depends on a lot of different factors Gluten is a protein found in wheat and grain products People on a glutenfree diet often avoid wheat rye and barley though there is also debate on whether to avoid oats as well A glutenfree diet allows for fresh fruits vegetables meatpoultryfish and many dairy products Unprocessed beans and nuts are also acceptable as well as products made with rice corn and soy If not buying fresh food its important to always read food labels to look for foods specifically labeled as glutenfree For example foods like cereal bread and lunch meat may or may not contain gluten so the only way to know for sure is to check the packaging The food industry can use gluten in many products that dont seem like they would contain gluten so its important to always read the label first Having a family history of food allergies could mean that your granddaughter may have a genetic predisposition to having food allergies as well It may be beneficial for her to try an elimination diet to identify any food allergies sensitivities or intolerances that she may have The basic premise of this eating plan is to initially restrict eating to very basic foods and then to gradually reincorporate more foods The person doing this can then better discern which foods trigger a negative response when added back into their diet Review this WebMD article for more information on elimination diets and also consult with a doctor or registered dietitian before implementing drastic dietary changes Microdermabrasion will most likely have little to no effect I have seen good results from Thermage but it can take more than one treatment and is not always effective Your dermatologist will help you determine if you are a good candidate for this procedure Radiofrequency treatments such as Thermage can help tighten the skin in this area to some extent Your dermatologist

definitely wouldnt say that just because you felt sick and dizzy after hitting your elbow you broke it Drink 32 oz of warm water in the morning Not hot but definitely warm If no change do it again around 4pm Depending upon your situation you may have to do this for a couple of days This remedy cures constipation without a laxative and restores the body with water that you might be lacking Warm water moves quickly into the intestinal track without some of the muscle contractions that come into play with cold water If this doesnt work see a doctor immediately Generally these are the dietary suggestions  Use small feedings Include some highprotein foods to speed healing  Avoid personal intolerances such as citrus juices which can cause pain during exacerbations  Limit gastric stimulants if not tolerated such as caffeine alcohol peppermint black pepper garlic cloves and chili powder  Include high protein foods and vitamin C rich foods to promote healing  Avoid smoking I know this isnt dietary but I thought it was important to mention  Im sorry to hear of your mothers cancer but am happy to learn it was discovered early and had not spread elsewhere in her body That is very good news When you ask will she do OK I think you mean will she survive Its impossible to answer that question When a person gets cancer there is always a chance of it spreading or returning whether or not they receive additional treatment like chemotherapy Your mother is not very elderly at age 75 but it sounds like she has made a choice in favor of quality of life This is certainly her decision to make You can give your mom peace of mind by being very supportive of her choice Do not feel if the cancer returns that she made a mistake by opting out of chemotherapy Having the drug treatment may not have kept any future cancer away anyway Enjoy the time you have together now and try not to worry too much about what tomorrow holds Your mother may outlive us all Wishing you and your mother well If youre so weak you truly feel almost lifeless you really need to seek immediate medical attention Any number of things could cause you to experience sharp stomach pains but an inability to eat combined with extreme weakness is cause for alarm Please have someone take you to the emergency room or call for an ambulance Im sorry youre going through this and wish you all the best Im sorry your husband is going through this and its good of you to help him with it Several conditions can cause the symptoms you describe so it wouldnt hurt to see a medical professional for an opinion Assuming the cause is benign that is not lifethreatening however your husband or you might consider keeping a diary of what he eats every day and how it affects his stomach issues If this is a  it might come to light through a diary Your husband also could try going on a bland diet to see if that helps his problem In a bland diet foods generally are cooked free of fiber and excessive fat and not spicy Examples are white rice chicken and broth If you begin with this type of diet you can then add foods one at a time to see if any one of them triggers an adverse reaction in your husband I hope this helps No this is not OK Yes you should see a doctor or psychotherapist or psychiatrist is very common and there are many very good medications available these days to treat it The same is true of  which might be what youre experiencing and which could cause the shortness of breath nausea and stomachache you describe You are not alone in your feelings Many people experience the same things which I hope brings you comfort A doctor can help you figure out whats going on and suggest treatment for you You deserve to live a happy full fulfilled lifeYoure worth it Personally I do not believe in taking antidepressants without talk therapy also called cognitive therapy I think you might benefit from a combination of both and I encourage you to seek this help I wish you all the best  specifically is known to turn the tongue andor stool black temporarily This condition can persist for a few days after you take the product The effect depends on how much Pepto you took too If the black stool goes away after a few days you probably have nothing to worry about If it persists for more than a week you probably should see a health care provider Bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract everything from your stomach to your rectum can cause the stool to turn black Im going to assume however that the situation is temporary due to the use of pink bismuth Wishing you all the best for a speedy recovery Im sorry this situation is causing you distress Normal bowel frequency can range from about three times a day to about three times a week Bowel frequency is highly individualized Since you have a history of frequent bowel movements it sounds like thats the normal rhythm of your digestive system But it also sounds like the situation has changed recently since you say its now interfering with work That means you should get checked out by a health care professional You can start with your primary care provider He or she can help you determine if theres anything abnormal going on with your system and if it needs to be treated Best wishes as you get this sorted out The short answer is this Your father should continue taking all these medications until a doctor tells him he can stop Perhaps it would help to explain what some of the medications are for As you indicated the metformin is for blood sugar issues Part of the reason your dads blood sugar is controlled is because he is using this pill He should follow up regularly with a doctor regarding his diabetes and should get a hemoglobin A1C blood test every 3 months at the lab The is indeed a blood pressure pill Again the reason your dads blood pressure is controlled is at least partly due to taking this pill Its very important he not stop or decrease his blood pressure medication after having an angioplasty is a blood thinning medication If your dad had stents placed in the arteries of his heart during the angioplasty the doctor may want to keep him on clopidogrel for a year or longer This medication helps prevent the bloods platelet cells from sticking to the stents and causing a blood clot is a medication to help keep your dads cholesterol within normal limits Excessive cholesterol in the blood can cause clogged arteries and heart problems Sorbitrate treats a couple of different heart conditions including angina chest pain So as you can see your dad needs all of these medications to help manage his diabetes blood pressure and heart problems He should not stop or reduce his use of these medications If you have any questions about this please follow up with his doctor Best to you both Im sorry to hear youre going through this Unfortunately a number of things could cause the symptoms youre describing Id suggest you keep working with your health care provider to find a cause for these symptoms Even though youve undergone some testing already if you dont have a diagnosis you need to keep pushing Dont give up on this A number of conditions that could cause the symptoms you describe can take a long time to be diagnosed Its important you work closely with your health care providers to get all possible testing done in order to arrive at a diagnosis Also sometimes tests need to be repeated and the results compared to previous tests in order to get an accurate diagnosis I suggest you keep copies of all your own medical records including films from CT MRI etc in case you have to change doctors or opt to get a second opinion Again Im sorry youre dealing with this and hope your care team can arrive at a diagnosis and some treatment options soon All the best to you This concerns me too and I want to urge you to make an appointment with your health care provider to have this checked out Its impossible to say whats going on without doing a physical examination lab work and so on But the situation you describe doesnt sound normal to me and I think it warrants an investigation I hope Im not alarming you I dont think you need to run to the emergency room or anything like that There could be a very simple reason why youre experiencing this big belly issue but I dont want you to delay getting checked out by your primary care provider I wish you all the best If you have routinely taken your birth control pills with no lapses it would be very rare indeed to become pregnant But not impossible You should see a gynecologist immediately for a serum pregnancy test to make sure you are not pregnant No one who is pregnant should take birth control pills but you do not give any indication of being pregnant other than your perception that your abdomen looks larger Normally this is not a sign of very early pregnancy Under typical circumstances a womans pregnancy doesnt start showing for at least four or five weeks Again though just to be safe you should get to a doctors office as soon as possible to find out for sure whats going on Wishing you well Congratulations on losing 40 pounds That is amazing and you should be proud of yourself What youre perceiving as fat around your midsection may in fact be excess skin Sometimes when a person loses a large amount of weight the skin that had stretched out is not able to firm back up when the weight is lost If this is the case theres no exercise you can do to help that flab You can confirm whether or not you have excessive belly skin by consulting your health care provider He or she can tell you if you have more body fat to lose or if you have a skin problem If its a skin problem your only recourse is surgery to remove the excess skin This surgery is called   or tummy tuck Regardless pat yourself on the back for that great weight loss Honestly the only way to diagnose strep is through a lab test Even if all the signs like throat redness and symptoms like soreness are there it still may not be strep Even white spots in the back of the mouth are no guarantee its a case of strep is almost always accompanied by fever Are you using a thermometer to measure your sons temperature or are you relying on the old handtotheforehead method Its very important to use a thermometer when assessing fever I mention this because it never ceases to amaze me how many people do not have this basic tool in their medicine cabinets Keep in mind also if youre giving your son acetaminophen Tylenol to ease the pain of the sore throat this could cause him to register a normal temperature on the thermometer because acetaminophen is a feverreducer Instead of speculating about what might be going on with your son I suggest you take him to his pediatrician Since the problem has been going on for nearly a week its not a bad idea to get medical attention I hope your little boy feels better soon Wishing you well So sorry to hear youre going through this How unpleasant Many conditions could cause the symptoms youre describing Anything from food poisoning to the flu could be at work here If you spike a fever over 101 degrees then its time to seek medical attention If you dont have a thermometer for taking your temperature I recommend you get one Its impossible to determine whether or not someone has a fever by simply feeling their forehead or judging by whether theyre sweating or things like that You really need to get a thermometer and measure your temperature accurately If youre not feverish then you probably can take a waitandsee attitude Drink plenty of fluids and dont try eating anything while youre actively vomiting or nauseated sick to your stomach If the symptoms continue to get worse if you get a fever or if you get sharp pains on the right side of your abdomen then it would be a good idea to see a health care provider I hope you feel better soon Im sorry to hear youre going through this Pain certainly is never fun Unfortunately its impossible to say whats causing this pain Diagnosing this requires a physical examination and possibly other testing Several conditions could cause the pain youre describing including simple constipation Specifically if youre over age 50 and have ever smoked if you would describe the pain as a tearing sensation I would not delay getting this checked out There is a rare condition called that can cause the type of pain youre describing and this would require immediate attention from a medical professional If youre under age 50 and this pain doesnt go away on its own within a few days you might make an appointment with your primary care provider to have it checked out I hope you feel better soon Well not exactly specifically refers to chest pain that occurs when the hearts oxygen supply is reduced This typically happens due to  which is a hardening and narrowing of the arteries that supply oxygenrich blood to the bodys tissues including the heart However there is a condition called also known as intestinal ischemia dead bowel dead gut and intestinal necrosis Ischemic bowel is caused by a lack of blood flow to the intestines and can cause severe abdominal pain Like angina ischemic bowel also can be caused by atherosclerosis If you have severe abdominal pain especially if its accompanied by vomiting diarrhea or fever you should seek medical attention Hope this helps Sorry to hear youre going through this It sounds awful Many conditions could cause those symptoms One possibility is food poisoning If youre not running a fever its probably OK to wait things out to see if the symptoms get better Meanwhile try to sip water or at least take ice chips The combination of vomiting and diarrhea can cause dehydration pretty quickly If youre still sick in a day or two it probably would be wise to call your health care provider or go to an urgent care facility Hope this helps Let me start by saying that is no less dangerous in terms of causing cancer than cigarettes I hope your husband realizes this Even if the stomach problems and diarrhea are new symptoms they could indeed be caused by smokeless tobacco usage People who use smokeless tobacco and spit still swallow some of the saliva that contains harmful substances Thats why some of the use can include cancers of the stomach pancreas and colon Of course smokeless tobacco use also can cause many types of oral cancers If your husbands symptoms dont clear up on their own or if theyre accompanied by fever pain or shortness of breath then he definitely should have them checked out by a medical professional You can start with your primary health care provider Best wishes to you and your husband Unfortunately no thats not normal Id suggest you call your OBGYN as soon as possible to report this If the baby had been moving before but has stopped you will want to get that checked out This helpful WebMD page on gives some good guidance about assessing and tracking how much your baby moves and when to call the doctor Wishing you and your baby all the best Im sorry to hear youre going through this Chronic can be more than a painful nuisance It can cause other health problems such as a bowel obstruction The bleeding you see after you have a bowel movement may be caused by  especially if the blood is bright red in color However any type of bleeding from the colon is worth having checked out by a medical professional Your best bet is to attack the cause of your chronic constipation Eat plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables to get needed fiber Avoid using laxatives as this can make the problem worse in a yoyo sort of way Be sure to drink plenty of water Hydration is very important for avoiding constipation I hope you find some relief soon The exact cause of isnt known but stress and anxiety are believed to be factors Its important to note IBS is a longterm disorder It is not something that comes and goes Usually a person who has symptoms of IBS has them regularly for many years On the other hand stress and anxiety can cause temporary upsets of the digestive tract too This is not IBS per se because the episodes go away Stress and anxiety can cause Stomach upset Nausea Diarrhea Among other things Its also important to note colonoscopy and endoscopy tests are not used to diagnose IBS These tests may be given to rule out more serious bowel problems like Crohns disease So the fact your colonoscopy and endoscopy results were fine does not mean you dont have IBS You should talk to your primary care provider to find out what your diagnosis is  if you have a diagnosis at all Wishing you well Id say if this has been going on for several days that you should seek medical attention You may not necessarily need to rush to the emergency room but you should at least call your primary care provider Several conditions can cause the symptoms youre describing including  an which is not cancer so dont get alarmed or  Its impossible to say whats going on without getting a physical exam If you begin to exhibit any of the following symptoms then you should go to the emergency room Fever over 101F Vomiting Yellowing of eyes or skin Pain getting much worse instead of better Difficulty breathingshortness of breath I hope you feel better soon Im sorry youre going through this It sounds miserable My initial reaction is that you should make an appointment to see a medical professional Diarrhea by which I mean mostly watery stool with little to no solid waste in it lasting longer than a week is not normal for an adult Usually if diarrhea is caused by food poisoning it resolves within a few days The pain you describe in conjunction with the diarrhea also is concerning While Im not suggesting you have any type of lifethreatening condition I would suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider as soon as possible Meanwhile its crucial for you to drink plenty of fluids Because your diarrhea has been going on for so long you might also want to sip a sports drink like Gatorade Dehydration might explain why you feel so weak I wish you all the best in finding out whats causing this problem Im sorry to hear youre going through this It sounds miserable and worrisome I want to emphasize your need to stay hydrated even if drinking water gives you nausea Maybe try drinking water at different temperatures to see if one is more palatable than another Or see if theres a vitamin water flavored water or type of sports drink you can tolerate Despite the fact youve been tested for and other conditions in the past my advice to you is to keep pursuing a cause for your symptoms Some conditions take a long time to be diagnosed such as  Sometimes tests need to be repeated periodically and the results compared in order to reach a diagnosis Its OK to be very proactive with your health care providers in pushing for additional testing or repeated tests depending on how much time has elapsed in order to get a diagnosis Id suggest keeping copies of all your lab results and imaging films Usually these can be provided to you on CDs for easy storage Youll want to keep these for new doctors you may consult and for comparison of test results over time I wish I had some magic suggestion to offer you in terms of a diagnosis but thats not the case Like I said hang in there and dont give up just because youve had a few tests done Keep going back to your providers to let them know you still have symptoms I wish you all the best The good news is that bright red blood on the surface of your stool or in the toilet water or on the toilet paper usually isnt the type of blood associated with a cancer of the digestive tract Usually bright red blood like that is more associated with or a minor rectal bleed due to passing hard stool or straining hard during a bowel movement When we talk about blood in the stool related to a cancer this blood usually isnt recognizable as blood It usually turns the stool black or tarry The pain in your upperright abdomen could be caused by many conditions including gallstones Because the pain has persisted for over 2 weeks Id suggest you get it checked out The pain may or may not be related to the other symptoms you describe Only a medical professional can give you a firm diagnosis I hope you feel better soon Well no thats not normal Its probably something you should have checked out by a medical professional Many conditions can cause this type of bloating from to issues Your primary health care provider can evaluate whats going on and help get you proper treatment if its needed Some things that cause bloating such as food intolerances only require an adjustment to your diet Other problems such as acid reflux may require medication Wishing you all the best My best advice in situations like this is dont give up Some conditions can take years to diagnose so its crucial for the patient to routinely follow up on symptoms new and old I suggest your husband continue to seek a diagnosis for his ailment Id suggest he return periodically to report his symptoms havent improved and have tests repeated at appropriate intervals Sometimes just getting a long medical history recorded can lead a health care provider to see a pattern emerge which in turn can lead to a diagnosis Meanwhile make sure your husband maintains good hydration because chronic diarrhea can be very dehydrating Also you might consider keeping a log to record the datestimes of his bowel movements and also what he eats Sometimes correlating these two factors can help with diagnosis too Wishing you both all the best Its good of you to be aware of this potential complication of antibiotics the infection Azithromycin Zpack isnt as wellassociated with as broadspectrum antibiotics like penicillin or cephalosporins are but I still would suggest you take your daughter to the doctor for this I mean having diarrhea 10 days after finishing a course of antibiotics isnt normal and that alone warrants having it checked out Until you can get your daughter in to see the doctor this isnt something you need to go to the emergency room for be sure to keep your daughter wellhydrated I usually suggest drinking plenty of plain water with a glass of sports drink thrown in every now and then for electrolyte balance You also can water down a sports drink by half with water Mainly just fluids fluids fluids Also its crucially important your daughter washes her hands thoroughly with soap and water each time she goes to the bathroom is not affected by hand sanitizers Lots of handwashing will help keep this from spreading if it is in fact  I hope your daughter feels better soon Sorry youre experiencing this Bloating is especially uncomfortable Usually pale or claycolored stools indicate a lack of bile in the stool However the color change can also be related to consuming antidiarrheal medications like Kaopectate If your symptoms persist or get worse Id suggest you see a doctor Sometimes claycolored stool can indicate a blocked bile duct such as from a gallstone If your scelera the white parts of the eyeyball start turning yellow or your skin gets yellowish or if you spike a fever or start vomiting you should seek immediate medical attention by going to the emergency room These could be signs of a serious bile duct obstruction I hope you feel better soon Yes you certainly can from freaking out If I had a nickel for every patient who fainted from stress when receiving an injection or having an IV started Id be one rich nurse Frequently when a person passes out from stress its due to whats called a vasovagal response This refers to a momentary malfunction of the parts of the nervous system including the vagus nerve that regulate the heart rate Heart slows down blood vessels dilate blood pressure drops and you pass out However you seem to faint more than would normally be expected Vasovagal syncope the fancy medical term for fainting while freaking out usually requires a strong trigger I would think back relaxation would bring on feelings of euphoria not stress that causes fainting Because youre still having fainting episodes after several months its time to go back to the doctor to see if something besides a vasovagal response is causing this Also if you can feel a fainting episode coming on try to quickly sit down on the ground before you fall And always try to protect your head Best to you Im sorry to hear youve been going through this Nobody likes being ill Many different conditions could cause what youre describing One likely candidate is  Certain types of food poisoning can cause bloody stool These types often are accompanied by a high fever over 101F You should seek medical attention if your symptoms havent cleared up within a few days If this is indeed food poisoning it probably will go away on its own Meanwhile you need to be sure to drink plenty of fluids to avoid becoming dehydrated Assuming youre otherwise healthy I often recommend halfstrength Gatorade or a few glasses of water alternating with one glass of Gatorade to help you stay hydrated and maintain electrolyte balance One thing you dont want to do is take an overthecounter antidiarrhea preparation If this does turn out to be food poisoning diarrhea is your bodys way of getting rid of the toxin So if things dont clear up within a few days see a health care professional before you think about treating yourself Feel better soon Its definitely possible to experience real physical symptoms from emotions So yes that sick feeling in the stomach could be a true physical symptom of your guilty feelings Stress can produce many physical symptoms from a racing heart to dermatitis Some peoples bodies are very sensitive to emotion and express those emotions through physical symptoms Im sorry youre going through this and suggest you get counseling to help relieve both your feelings of guilt and the physical symptoms those feelings are causing Best wishes to you Im sorry to hear youre going through this It can be very discouraging when we feel were going our best for our body but then we get sick anyway From just the information youve given its impossible to tell if youre doing anything wrong or not It sure doesnt sound like it Make sure youre eating a balanced diet and consuming enough calories Exercising every day increases your calorie requirements Remember that supplements are OK but theyre no substitute for food Make sure youre getting enough water Make sure you practice good hand hygiene by washing your hands thoroughly or using an antibacterial rub regularly throughout the day and especially after touching any fitness equipment at the gym Avoid touching your eyes nose or mouth as much as possible Many germs get transmitted this way If its been more than a year since your last physical exam why not schedule an appointment with your health care provider He or she can order a full set of blood work labs which will help discover if you have some underlying medical condition that is causing your symptoms I wish you all the best First Im very sorry to hear of your loss My sympathy to you and your family As to your question it sounds like youre asking about the manner of death listed on the death certificate In general a death certificate has a section called Cause of Death which lists the direct event that led to a persons death such as myocardial infarction heart attack The death certificate usually also has a section called Manner of Death which often consists of checkboxes labeled natural accident homicide suicide undetermined etc  a perforated bowel would be considered a natural death A natural death usually is one that arises from a disease process or aging Keep in mind I am not a physician or lawyer Im just offering information based on my best knowledge of death certificates If you have questions about your motherinlaws death certificate you can consult the physician who certified the death certificate His or her name should be listed The Centers for Disease Control CDC has a page on its website about how to fill out a death certificate I am unable to link to it here but a search of their site should reveal it Again Im very sorry for your loss Aw Im sorry for your little one Youre certainly describing the classic symptoms of  Luckily there are a few things you can do at home to see if you can help your child have a bowel movement However if your child goes more than a couple of days without a bowel movement you need to call your pediatrician One thing you can do is give your child some prune juice Unless your child has blood sugar problems diabetes he or she should be able to tolerate this treatment just fine Prune juice is a tried and true approach to constipation relief The best way to treat constipation is to prevent it Feed your child a healthy diet that includes plenty of fiber from whole grains fruits and vegetables Also make sure your child drinks plenty of water and gets some exercise every day These three components are crucial in preventing constipation Please do not give your child a laxative without consulting your pediatrician Dosing can be tricky with children and your pediatrician is in the best position to advise you about what laxative to use and what dosage to give Wishing you all the best Im sorry to hear youre going through this Sometimes pregnancy can stretch the abdominal muscles out so much that they cant snap back Theyre kind of like elastic that way  and Im sure youve seen how floppy an elastic waistband gets after its been overstretched Id suggest you visit your doctor to find out if he or she thinks this is the problem in your case If so he or she may be able to tell you whether or not abdominal muscle exercises will help If all else fails you can have this corrected with a cosmetic surgery procedure called abdominoplasty or   In this surgery the abdominal muscles are literally sewed back together to give your belly a tight look again However this surgery is not recommended for any woman who plans to have more children Save it for the time when youre confident your family is complete Probably not the news you wanted to hear but I wanted to be honest with you Wishing you all the best Oh ouch So much for that whole working out is healthy thing right ha ha Well I think you need to get this checked out Id suggest making an appointment with your primary care provider You may merely have strained a muscle but then again you could have torn one And that would require medical attention Luckily the abdomen is protected with layer upon layer of muscle so its not too likely you suffered say a bowel herniation or something Nonetheless if you start running a fever or vomiting or develop any other unusual symptoms you might consider heading for an urgent care Otherwise youre probably fine to just check in with your primary care provider And of course dont do any weightlifting of any kind until youre cleared by your doc to do so Even leg work can strain your abs and you really need to rest them for now Best wishes Im sorry to hear your granddaughters going through this especially at such a young age Im obviously not a doctor but the first thing that comes to my mind when you describe your granddaughters symptoms is  In this condition a persons stomach does not empty as quickly as its supposed to Even though gastroparesis is not common Ive known several people with the condition All of them said they experienced pain in the upperright quadrant and all of them were frustrated that physicians told them pain is not a symptom of gastroparesis In my opinion gastroparesis is not wellunderstood by most physicians If your granddaughter ultimately is diagnosed with this condition I suggest you find a specialist to help her She will need someone with deep knowledge of this unusual condition in order to help her learn how to meet her nutritional needs with a stomach that chronically malfunctions Note Im not attempting to diagnose your granddaughter with gastroparesis Im only saying this is one possibility of whats going on based on the information you provided It may be worth checking into this possibility more  or at least getting it ruled out Wishing you and your granddaughter well Great question Sorry to hear about your concussion though I hope youve been taking things easy as your brain heals Tylenol generic name acetaminophen with codeine is fine to take even if you have a concussion In fact its a better choice than something like ibuprofen because Tylenol with codeine does not thin the blood By the way your concussion symptoms should clear up by the threeweek mark If youre still experiencing any symptoms at that time it would be a good idea to get checked out by a health care provider to make sure you didnt hurt your head worse than you thought Also whenever you have a question about a medications usage you can call and speak to a pharmacist If he or she cant give you specific information such as the safety of taking TylenolIII when you have a concussion feel free to call your primary care providers office and ask to speak with a nurse there Theyre always happy to help Best wishes to you Im sorry to hear youre feeling poorly Often the best initial treatment for is to avoid taking anything by mouth including water until the vomiting stops Then start with small sips of water to make sure you arent going to start vomiting again Work your way up to regular food slowly After the vomiting stops be sure to stay as wellhydrated as you can without triggering more nausea If the vomiting is severe or doesnt clear up within a day you should seek medical attention Also if your  such as severe abdominal pain or head injury you should seek immediate medical attention If you have no allergies to medication you can probably treat the vomiting and aches with overthecounter medications Ask a pharmacist what he or she recommends If you did not get a  be aware the is already underway Wash your hands frequently to avoid spreading the flu if thats what you have or any potentially contagious illness Hope you feel better soon Im sorry to hear youre going through this Have any of your medical providers done an Xray of your abdomen If not I suggest you contact your primary health care provider and request one Tell him or her you just want to make sure youre not walking around with a retained instrument or sponge An Xray is a cheap fast way to make sure the surgeons left nothing behind by accident If youve already had an Xray to confirm there are no foreign bodies in your abdomen then Id suggest you consult a different doctor for a second opinion on what could be causing this pain It seems like pain this severe should be attributable to some cause Id suggest you press your health care providers to find a cause for this pain Wishing you all the best Well the first thing I have to ask is Is your daughter sexually active If so and shes missed a period then it might be wise for her to take a home pregnancy test At age 15 the menstrual cycle isnt necessarily settled in yet Irregular periods arent uncommon in that age group and the stomachaches and nausea could be due to stress or anxiety In other words I wouldnt jump to any conclusions If your daughter is not pregnant and the other symptoms dont go away then its worth a trip to see your primary health care provider He or she can investigate the cause of your daughters symptoms and recommend treatment Wishing you both all the best I guess my main concern here is that youre not following up with your medical provider Who ordered the blood work Did they tell you to come back for a followup appointment If not you need to schedule an appointment anyway because youre symptomatic Your health care provider is the only person in a position to give you a diagnosis and help interpret the lab results so I suggest you go back to see him or her as soon as possible I hope you feel better soon The classic instructions for taking thyroid hormone have always been to take it on an empty stomach and not to eat for an hour after taking it Whats more important I think is to take your thyroid medication in a consistent manner In other words if you have to take it with food every day to take it with food every day Dont take it with food one day and then take it on an empty stomach the next day Consistency in your regimen will yield the best results More importantly when you do your annual or whenever thyroid labs the results will reflect how much thyroid youre actually getting on your chosen regimen I would say if its possible for you to take your thyroid medication first thing in the morning on an empty stomach thats probably your best bet for making sure you get the maximum uptake from each dose

subspecialist as soon as you can If your daughter is complaining about her right lower quadrant of her abdomen she needs to be seen by a doctor Although one of the serious causes can be appendicitis there are other reason that can cause this Only after examining her can a doctor decide whether she needs a CT or not If the doctor is not suspicious about appendicitis he may advise against a CT

30 minutes after taking this medication It is important not to exceed the recommended dosage The common side effects for this medication are constipation and stomach upset This is largely due to the iron component and can be minimized by eating a meal when taking the tablet and by using a stool softener for extended complications with constipation If all the instructions have been followed and the side effects become more intense you should consult your health care professional You may also consider working with your pharmacist to find an alternative medication There are several brand names

time It is a safe and effective medication used within the recommended prescribing guidelines The medication is intended to decrease the release of stomach acid Therefore it is the most effective if taken 30 minutes prior to having a meal This medication has 24hour coverage Therefore it should not be taken prior to every meal It is intended to be taken on an empty stomach If you take it with food the stomach will release acid to digest the food The acid can decrease the absorption of the medication and decrease the effectiveness Therefore I would not recommend taking the medication with food or a meal It is important to take the dose 30 minutes prior to a meal or first thing in the morning Every antibiotic has different absorption characteristics Some antibiotics work better with or without food Some are better with a fatty substance such as milk However some may have a drug interaction with the calcium contained in dairy products In this case milk should not be drunk with the medication and the consumption of the two should be separated out by about two hours The best liquid to take medication with is water It is important to check with your local pharmacist at the time of picking up the antibiotic or any medication to see if there are any food restrictions with your prescriptions Revolution Abdominal Cuts is a product that is not FDA approved Therefore we do not know

that you are pregnant then consult yor physician for treatment of the ovarian cyst if you do in fact have one If it is large enough it may need to be removed surgically and if its just a small one it

never had a rash although many people do but had extreme fatigue neurologic problems and was often tachy Docs also were thinking thyroid but it was normal It was my eye doctor who finally figured it out and sent me to a specialist Just a thought because they are insidious underdiagnosed diseases and on the rise And I would sort of go in cycles too which is apparently common Some days I couldnt

central nervous system is damaged What State do you live in I have a similar issue and it has lasted about two months I feel fullbloated and really have not been eating much I have been burping a ton I thought I might be pregnant becuase I am a little nauseous too My sister thought my burping was funny until it happened to her She has been reading about hormone levels and found that Melatonin is a hormone in your body and changes all the time like insulin levels In the winter with lack of sunlight melatonin levels can be high and stay in the gut Her book said this creates high acid levels in the stomach and thus you will have more gas We are trying full spectrum light therpy to get our circdian rhythm back to normal and maybe surpress day time melatonin from producing Do you still have symptoms What are your symptoms I have been bloated and burping for two months I am nauseous too though My sister and I are looking into our hormone levels We found that Melatonin is a hormone in your

bladder This is a question that a pharmacist is going to ask that patient a lot of other questions I need to know who has the upset stomach And for how long have they had this upset stomach This could be some occasional heartburn it could be though something much more serious Sometimes upset stomachs can also lead to things like viral infections So we may not want to necessarily treat it We want to find out if this is an elderly patient may be theyve had it for a long time and there is another medication that could be causing this upset stomach as well So we are going to have to find a little bit more information So things like telling us what medications you are taking Are you taking any overthecounter or herbals because they have a possibility of possibly causing an upset stomach as well

than Percocet so there could be a possibility that you are allergic to the Lorcet Stomach upset is common in pain medications so you can also try taking the medication with some food more of a meal

provider about other options Great question Some medications have to be taken on an empty stomach because it helps the medication dissolve and get into your bloodstream quicker Certain medications

time each day so you benefit from the medication If you ever have any questions about how to take your medications ask your pharmacist We are happy to help I would highly recommend heading to the ER

to prevent the stomach bug for several years now We have NEVER caught the stomach bug while using fresh squeezed lemon juice I will share our regimen once exposed we drink an ounce of fresh lemon juice twice a day for TEN days We make it into lemonade for our kids One of my daughters decided she didnt want lemon juice on day 5 and by that evening she was sick The rest of us started over again and drank lemonade for another 10 days and we were fine Since this one incident my kids never ever stop drinking their lemonade in fact they remind me to get it for them It has been 100 percent effective for us I have taken probiotics that are not refrigerated and they do work It is important to take prebiotics with them because that is what feeds the probiotics I had pain and bloating for three years I tried all those medicines that I was prescribed I had an upper GI two ultrasounds two xrays a nuclear test and blood work No doctor could figure me out I tried their medicines I tried herbs and nothing seemed to work Finally I found mastic gum I started taking two in the morning along with Aloe Vera Within a week my pain was gone I have given mastic gum to a couple of other people who were miserable One of them had been off work for two months This guy was back to work the next week Another person who was having some testing done to figure out their problems took this stuff and the pain was gone within two hours I dont take it everyday anymore just when I need it I also try to eat very healthy and stay away from high fat foods especially I hope this helps I had this problem for years I started taking mastic gum for a month or two and it went away I paired it with Aloe Vera I dont have to take it all the time now I only take it when I need it Fast forward 6 months I start having heart racingpalpation problems again I go see my GP and she thinks there might be something wrong with my heart I get a echo and heart monitor exam both come back normal I was worried about my heart but I was more worried about the fatigue that had set in I was going to work groggy every morning and taking 23 hour naps when I got home I would sleep the entire night and still be tired the next day On the weekends I would sleep for either the entire day Saturday or Sunday and feel a bit better to start over again the next week I begged my GP to do a thyroid test on me since I have family history of it but everything came back normal range CBC is normal and metabolic panel is normal I asked her to check for thyroid antibodies and my TPO is very slightly high I get an appointment with an Endo This brings us up to present I have felt better for about a week I have changed nothing I had my Endo appointment today in which I tell her everything and she said I may have been having a Hyperthyroid attack when all this happened but Im probably better now and I should do nothing I beg her to take more blood work since I feel better than I did but I still dont feel right I have also

inflammation of the esophagus It commonly caused by acid reflux There are over the counter acid reducer medications called H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors that can help acid reflux symptoms Symptoms like you are describing can also be caused by a side effect of certain medications Some medications that can cause these symptoms include ibuprofen naproxen aspirin and other antiinflammatory drugs The antibiotic doxycycline and the bisphosphonate drugs for osteoporosis can also cause similar symptoms There are some less common but serious conditions that could also cause symptoms like you describe such as certain infections or tumors It is important for you to see a doctor if your symptoms persist for an examination and medical evaluation After surgical removal of the gallbladder it is

cause an infection in her pancreas if the stones didnt dislodge and return to normal Again she had sever pain and they only told us if it persists that that would need to be done Yesdefinitely I have

your stomach pain and get that checked out as soon as possible The other symptoms exept maybe the itchy groin area can be attributed to Diabetes but again this needs to be verified by further

that you have made a change and are more hungry its time to put more thought into your meals You want to eat 3 balanced meals every day that contain 35 food groups at each meal whole grain lean protein fruit vegetable dairy and healthy fat If you are hungry in between meals have a snack with 23 food groups eg apple with peanut butter yogurt with nuts cheese stick with whole grain crackers So if you are used to having some cereal in the morning that may no longer be enough to keep you going Adding a lean protein source and more filling carbs like oatmeal along with chopped fruit and nuts will stick with you longer Protein eggs lean meat nutsseeds soy fish cheese and fiberrich foods frutis veggies whole grains and beans are the most filling and will keep hunger away longer For more on

else going on There are a number of things that could be contributing to your gas symptoms The growling stomach you mention is actually your intestines contracting from the movement of air through the intestines Here are some potential causes of your gas Taking in air through drinking with straws carbonated beverages chewing gum smoking and eating hard candies Eating too many gasproducing vegetables such as cauliflower broccoli cabbage brussels sprouts onions artichokes beans and asparagus Certain fruits like apples pears and peaches may cause problems The inability to digest certain foods like lactose in milk Not enough beneficial bacteria in your gastrointestinal system This WebMD article provides more details on potential causes of gas You may want to see a registered dietitian

speaking from experience on this one This typically goes away in the second trimester Just try to plan and eat nutritious food at regular intervals and stay active Your doctor will track your weight so be sure to keep your appointments Because you are advancing your diet it could be a normal transition as long as it does not last but only your doctor will know for sure I would stay in close contact with your doctor about your bowel movements and what that means for your treatment and diet moving forward In terms of solid food a soft diet is the easiest on the gastrointestinal system because it contains little fiber The normal transition is moving from liquids to soft to regular You want to stay away from fruits more likely to irritate your stomach such as those with tough skins or seeds Check with your doctor to see how long you diet needs to be limited There is no research to show that the stomach shrinks when dieting or following a low calorie diet The only way to decrease the size of the stomach is through surgery which is certainly not for everyone But by changing what and how you eat you can change your appetite For example eating regular balanced meals at the table not letting yourself get over hungry fitting in regular exercise and getting adequate sleep can go a long way towards curbing your appetite Hunger is not a bad thing but something we all need to learn

food due to your disease your body likely got used to that Now that I assume the celiac is under control you are still eating the same way but your body is now absorbing the food Weight gain can also change hunger hormones increasing appetite further People who lose large amounts of weight may end up having excess skin Each person is different though and its hard to predict who is more vulnerable Some people choose to have excess skin removed once they have maintained weight loss for a period of time The key is to lose weight for your health and quality of life and then you can decide what you want to do if there is extra skin I am not aware of sweeteners sugars or artificial sweeteners causing problems for stomach ulcers That being said too much alcohol can make them worse The key is finding out the cause of the stomach ulcer and getting the proper treatment Here is more about Excessive production of gas by bacteria is a common cause of intermittent abdominal bloatingdistention Bacteria can produce too much gas in three ways First the amount of gas that bacteria produce varies from individual to individual In other words some people may have bacteria that produce more gas either because there are more of the bacteria or because their particular bacteria are better at producing gas Second there may be poor digestion and absorption of foods in the small intestine allowing more undigested food to reach the bacteria in the colon Examples of diseases of that involve poor digestion and absorption include lactose intolerance pancreatic insufficiency and celiac disease Third bacterial overgrowth can occur in the small intestine Under normal conditions the bacteria that produce gas are limited to the colon In some conditions these bacteria spread into the small intestine When this bacterial spread occurs food reaches the bacteria before it can be fully digested and absorbed by the small intestine This condition in which the gasproducing bacteria move into the small intestine is called bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine bowel Excessive production of gas by bacteria usually is accompanied by flatulence Increased flatulence may not always occur however since gas potentially can be eliminated in other ways  absorption into the body utilization by other bacteria or possibly by elimination at night without the awareness of the gaspasser Physical obstruction An obstruction blockage can occur virtually anywhere from the stomach to the rectum When the blockage is temporary or partial it can cause intermittent abdominal bloatingdistention For example scarring of the pylorus pyloric stenosis can obstruct the opening from the stomach into the intestines thereby blocking the complete emptying of the stomach An obstruction in the small bowel which is most commonly due to adhesions from a previous surgery is another cause of intermittent abdominal distention Severe constipation or fecal impaction hardened stool in the rectum can also obstruct the flow of the intestinal contents and result in distention Functional obstruction A functional obstruction is not caused by an actual physical blockage but rather by the poor functioning of the muscles of the stomach or intestines that propel the intestinal contents When these muscles are not working normally the intestinal contents will accumulate and distend the abdomen Examples of functional obstruction include gastroparesis paralysis of the stomach of diabetes chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction an unusual condition in which the muscles of the small intestine do not work normally and Hirschsprungs disease in which a small stretch of colonic muscle does not contract normally due to missing nerves There is accumulating scientific evidence that some patients with abdominal bloating and distention due to gas may have a functional abnormality of the intestinal muscles that prevents gas from being normally transported through the intestine and expelled Instead their gas accumulates in the intestine Among patients with irritable bowel syndrome IBS with abdominal bloating or distention as an important symptom the gas accumulates in the small intestine and not the colon The gas accumulates during the day and is greatest in the evening Dietary fiber or fiber used for treating constipation can cause bloating without increasing the production of gas in the intestine It is believed that this sensation of bloating and possibly even distention is caused by the slowed passage of gas through the intestine which is caused by fiber Of course some types of fiber may lead to increased production of gas because they are digested to some extent by the colonic bacteria Intestinal hypersensitivity Some people appear to be very sensitive hypersensitive to distention of their intestines and they may feel bloated even with normal amounts of digesting food gas and fluid in the intestine after a meal The bloating may be aggravated or even progress to distention if the meal contains substantial amounts of fat Possibly hypothyroid Look up conditions on here and see if they relate That would be my best guess without knowing more It can make you feel really bad if left untreated No increased heart rate is not a normal feature of heartburn However pain and anxiety can increase heart rate If youre still having this problem I would get

acute pharyngitis The nausea could be caused by the antibiotic or just by being sick Try to eat something if you can  anything But if you cant keep water or liquids down you need to let your doctor know You dont want to become dehydrated Also if youre not starting to feel better after a couple of days give your doctor a call Several of the symptoms you describe such as diarrhea chest pains and stomach pains are not symptoms of pharyngitis so thats something you need to discuss with your doctor to see if something else is going on You definitely should see your doctor The shortness of breath is a concern and you dont want to ignore that In addition your lack of bowel movements and change in size of stool is also something that should be checked by your doctor I would go ahead and make an appointment so you can get to the bottom of whats happening There is no particular connection between IBS and acid reflux People with IBS do not usually have digestive problems that involved the stomach Typically the problems are with the colon However in some people we do see IBS and acid reflux occur together but there is no know or specific association between the two It definitely sounds like it could be an abdominal hernia This most commonly happens around the belly button or in a previous site of surgery While most hernias are harmless some can be dangerous Its best to get your doctor to check it out to make sure its nothing that needs treatment right now The symptoms you describe can be signs of early pregnancy I have no way of knowing if this is it or what your GP suggests which is also a possibility A few days after conception the fertilized egg attaches itself to wall of the uterus This can cause one of the earliest signs of pregnancy  spotting and sometimes cramping

gastric sleeve weight loss surgery its very important to get enough protein to help with healing and recovery This is something you should ask your doctor as everyone is different In general most people need about 60 to 75 grams of protein a day Protein is important for longterm weight maintenance as well since it helps you feel full longer Due to malnutrition after weight loss surgery some people may also lose some hair Protein can help with that as well But again you should ask your doctor how much is right for you and also to get suggestions on the type of protein since its important to get complete proteins That means all the amino acids that help make up protein in the body Meats are complete proteins but most nonmeat proteins are not But if you combine certain proteins such as rice and beans you can get all the amino acids in one meal I am not sure of your diet but you may wish to look at common allergens such as wheat gluten and dairy Possibly a stomach ulcer worst case

your excess fat gradually as rapid weight reduction makes your skin looser  aiming for no more than 122 pounds of fat per week Weight lift 23 times a week incorporating core exercises along with the usual total body weight program Eat enough protein every day to build and maintain optimal muscle 6080 grams per day Core work does not affect loose skin but you need to do it to strengthen and shape your ab and Pilates is terrific Get your body fat  done and aim for 25 or so and then whatever the weight is commensurate with that go with that Once you have achieved the body composition that is optimal for you look at your abdomen There is no magic pill or potion or exercise that will eliminate your loose skin You will look and feel terrific at your goal body composition Youll then have to ask yourself how much your ab really bothers you  You might also meet with a plastic surgeon to discuss options Many people who have lots of skin sag do undergo a simple tummy tuck Some of my patients whove dropped 50 or more pounds live with their loose skin while others head for surgical correction This is a personal decision Yours is a common cry heard from women who tend to deposit their body fat in their abdominal area First you are not obese We have to keep these measurements in perspective Look at the other women on both sides of your family Do some of them have the same fat distribution Genetics does play a role Your waist size is very good at 30 inches but may seem to be large in your eyes because the rest of you is so much smaller in comparison Most women would love to have a 30inch waist Just as an aside ask your gynecologist to check you for ovarian cysts Sometimes women have polycystic ovaries that lead to a greater abdominal fat distribution There is a simple sonogram and blood test you would undergo If you dont have this issue then youre left with your genetics Some women simply have more active fat storage enzyme in their abdominal area Others bemoan the fact that they have it mostly in their buttocks or thighs Everyones different here Here are some tips to optimize your waistline 1 Watch out with overconsumption of alcohol It tends to favor ab fat distribution Moderation please 2 Eating too many breads pastas and heavy complex carbs bloats most women esp in the ab area 3 Watch your posture If youre tall hey Im 59 so I know and you stoop over that will make your tummy look large to you and the world Straighten up and practice good core power throughout the day 4 Speaking of core I would most definitely do a core program including pilates You need to keep that long waist and back strong and toned 5 Try to keep your calories spread out over the day Eating too much late at night leads to a tummy hang in the morning Yes your pain could be cardiac it also could be ulcer related among other things You really need to have this evaluated especially to rule out a cardiac event Good luck and God bless Absolutely people do get sick to their stomach when they are stressed and have a panic attack its a pretty common occurrence so dont feel youre alone or that you are in some way weak What do you do to handle your stress on a daily or weekly basis I would recommend that there are several selfhelp things that you can begin to do for yourself The first of these in addition to exercise would be to ensure that you were eating a balanced diet get sufficient sleep get out with friends and socialize on some semiregular basis get involved in activities you enjoy that are not stressful and used relaxation breathing on a daily basis One thing you should also consider is having a medical checkup just to ensure there are no physical problems I am having the same problemMy Stomach is so tender and soreI have excruciating pain I have had a lot of test and all the Doctors said was Gastritis and Colitis I am not taking any medication for this and just wondering what I should do I cant live in this kind of painThere should be some kind of cure for this I dont have Diarrhea or sick stomach Depends on how much has consumed Remember Lettuce is mostly water and roughage Consider also where the Lettuce came from  as if a salad bar  there may be bacteria such as ecoli or salmonella Best to have a stool culture taken if this continues beyond two days People just simply refuse to wash their hands  and contamination spreads Also depending on sprays  if it was washed before it was consumed Antibiotics are very hard on your stomach if taken without food Google The Chronic Sinusitis Cure on the web may take care of your problem over the long term I know what you are going through is scary I have had most of the symptoms you mentioned in the past I think that it would be worth seeing a doctor because they provided me with a lot help and now I am more stable I know that it can also be scary going to a doctor but remember that you are in control of the situation and if you feel uncomfortable suggest a new doctor I hope this helps My little girl was colicky as well and nothing helped but soy formula Its not harmful at all yo your child Your baby may have a sensitivity to milk based formulas Colicky babies seem to do better on soy because its seems to soothe there Stomachs and possibly a premature digestive system can cause flare ups of colic Had bad stomach and Back pain at the same time with a loose stool with blood in it but the stomach and back pain was severe not hurting right now though I wouldnt worry There are many factors that can through off a period However if it continues exactly the same for 23 more months I would get an appointment with a OBGYN There could fibroids ovarian cycts the list is long Please see a upper GI specialist Like yourself my stomach was in so much pain with eating and drinking and anything over the counter would not work I had out patient procedure today by the upper GI and the ulcers were confirmed I am now being properly treated and am on my way to feeling better Rai Starr on FB or raistarr1 on Skype Feel better soon Blessings My heart goes out to you and I certainly hope you have already discovered the problem Im replying for the sake of others who may read this and wonder People tend to assume that if you have always had the symptoms then you have Celiac and if the symptoms appear after some time you dont have Celiac This seems logical but the trouble is that Celiac can be asymptomatic or it can remain asymptomatic for a time before becoming symptomatic In other words you can have the condition for a time or forever without having any notable symptoms My daughter began to flatulate quite severely at about age 11 Unbeknownst to us this was actually an uncommon symptom At age 13 she was diagnosed with both type one diabetes and Celiac Unless she had presented with t1d we would never have guessed to test her for Celiac The truth is that many people who are Celiac were not diagnosed immediately and suffered silently for years before any pain or symptoms of poor digestion presented My daughter began a glutenfree diet and her flatulence disappeared as oddly and quickly as it appeared Nearly six months later after her intestines had healed she accidentally ingested gluten at a restaurant Severe abdominal cramps came upon her though she had never experienced strong symptoms if any prior to that day I suppose her body gave out a louder scream once it knew how healthy felt No you dont have to have the symptoms all your life for you to still have Celiac Go to back to the physician be persistant You might also consider getting a second opinion too Oftentimes it simply takes awhile to find out what the underlying cause is I noticed that you didnt mention a biopsy out of all the tests you have had A biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing Celiac It may give an answer to something that has remained hidden too I am not saying that Celiac what you have but if you have exhausted other options you may want to opt for a biopsy during which time a tiny piece of your intestines is taken and scrutinized Also has the doctor considered issues with your inner ears When I had nausea and vertigo it turned out the be an inner ear issue called BPPV It would certainly seem as if the symptoms you have are all connected but it is possible that the dizziness is only mildly connected to the abdominal pain or even that they are different issues Wishing you relief Sharon Also contrary to popular belief avoid dairy products Although milk may coat your stomach it makes your stomach produce more acid to break down the enzymes in it If yours has been only for about a month lucky you Ive had mine for almost 4 mos and nothing is helping I dont eat spicy food drink alcohol or do dairy and still cant figure out what to eat It also depends on what kind of ulcer you have If its from bacteria try asking for antibiotics They can do blood tests to find out Yes you probably can if you are comfortable At one point however you wont be able to comfortably be on your stomach Everything is about comfort and discomfort If you can go for it If you cant dont do it No If this person truly has gastric ulcers she should be under the care of a good medical provider and on medications that will WORK to alleviate her pain and cure the ulcers I dont know how she was diagnosed or what tests have been run to determine the type and location of her ulcers but perhaps seeing a gastrorenterologist would be advisable Treating something that can be potenitally seriousoverthecounteris really not the best approach I would suggest that you see your medical provider so that you can have your rectum examined or have a flatplate xray of your abdomen No bowel movement for a week would seem to indicate a possible stool impaction but your comment about the anal area being obstructed concerns me that you could have a foreign body do you think this is possible or even a rectal prolapse Even if you are carefully examined a week ago it would be good to be reexamined Something is amiss Yesyou need a medical evaluation You may have had trauma to your kidney or bladder Save money some other ways but do avoid seeking a proper medical evaluationj for abdominal discomfort and hematuria A 995 temperature is normal for anyone The average temperature is 986 so this is just a one degree variation that doesnt mean you have a fever Temperatures also vary by time of day lower in the morning higher in the late afternoon by as much as two degrees If you are also tired and have an upset stomach you may be coming down with an illness but not likely influenza Influenza is a respiratory disorder more associated with harsh coughing body aches headaches and a high fever Me too To make matters worse I have 12 chickens and lots of eggs that I have to give away Like you eggs in other products are just fine but plain eggs are not Many people develop food intolerances It may not be an allergy but it could be so ask your medical provider to order an EGG IGG allergy test It is not in your head How did it happen Depending on the strain of Staph MRSA it may have been hospitalacquired There are also communityacquired strains but based on your posting of multiple antibiotics and a rarely used one I suspect that she had a hospitalacquired MRSA You may have the answer Abdominal discomfort and inability to have a bowel movement in a five year old is typically constipation the pain may be caused by gas or even stoolholding a condition where the child does not want to defecate and tries to hold it If the continues to have pain and is not defecating he will need to be properly examined If constipation has been a longterm issue he will need to see his medical provider anyway or some specific dietary intervention or perhaps the addition of a stool softener in his diet You didnt really ask a question but nothing you have shared is that alarming This is typical of a viral infection but as you know I have no way of blindly diagnosing or treating your granddaughter over the Internet so you will need to have her properly examined if the symptoms persist or worsen The moving sensation could be gasor stool that is slowing moving through your colon The intestines and stomach do move because of smooth muscles You can basically eat anything you want  your normal diet whatever that might be Your body will respond if this stomach virus is still rearing its ugly head For instance if you get nausea or diarrhea again you may have to eat a bit more reasonably for a few more days Viral infections last about a week but most people feel better on day four No no type of hernia would be able to untie your tied tubes and cause you to become pregnant Tubes are not just tied they are usually cut cauterized burned and separated The remote chance of them becoming viable again would be astronomical The only stomach hernias are hiatal They are no where near your sterilized Fallopian tubes You are safe You are probably finetemporarily immune to the bug that you just had but please keep in mind that there are more than one species of viruses that cause gastroenteritis If you daughter is schoolaged she could easily bring home a different one for you to enjoy for another week Cross your fingers and wash those hands Hemorrhoid Anal fissures Rectal polyps It is not possible to determine a source of this blood over the Internet You will need to see a medical provider as soon as possible so you can be properly examined Gonorrhea and Chlamydia can be detected by a urine test DNA probe but not a simple urine dipstick test It may be all in your head but unless you saw a cardiologist had an chest xray andor echocardiogram there is no way to know if someone has an enlarged heart or any other type of heart anomaly by just looking at the chest wall These sudden deaths of heatlhy people do happen unfortunately and many never knew they had a problem Have a good physical exam If you have a family history of cardiac problem get a clearance from a cardiologist Since you are so worried this may relieve your anxiety They do NOT look alikebut a person can sure have both Eczema atopic dermatitis is a chronic itchy dry skin condition that really likes some of those spots that you mentioned Eczema can come and go over a lifetime A mainstay of treatment is moisturization reducing inflammation and controlling this itching using an antihistamine Poison oak dermatitis tends to form linear vesiculationsblisters that form a line of sorts It tends to ooze appearing on the mostexposed to the plant oils area first then to other areas that may have been touched by contaminated hands or objects After a shower and a change of clothes poison oak does not spread by this drainage nor can you spread it to others Poison oak dermatitis lasts a few weeks and is mosteffectively treated by oral and topical steroids Itching can be controlled by antihistamines Breast feed your baby The chance of you or your baby getting Reye syndrome or having any consequences after one dose for the tiny amount of salicylates aspirin in the Pepto Bismol would be highly highly unlikely What is more important is that YOU stay wellhydrated and nourished until the virus has abated If this is not possible you can temporarily switch the baby to supplemental formulas or any stored breast milk until you are up to the mission again Get better You baby will be fine if you resume breastfeeding No eight days would not be considered normal for gastroenteritis vomitiing nauses diarrhea Men can be stubborn but what can you do if he refuses to seek medical care Zofran only helps the vomitingnothing else Most of these occurences are viral and viruses tend to last about a week Since he has exceeded that normal time span it would be in his best interest to consult his medical provider There are no medication that will cure stubborness These are vague and nonspecific symptoms Unfortunately it would be impossible to blindly diagnose your friend based on such little information This person should be seen by a medical provider so heshe can be properly examined diagnosed and treated  three things that cannot be accomplished over the Internet Yes that is the best course Actually that is the ONLY course that can be taken since viral infections do not respond to antibiotics Fever is harmless Fever is actually beneficial so it does not need to treated You can treat discomfort of course As long as the vomiting has stopped and the diarrhea is not too bad the best treatment is to maintain hydration either with water or commerciallyavailable electrolyte solutions Do not treat the diarrheathis must run its course so to speak It has been said that viruses last about a week if you treat them and seven days if you leave them run its course Most viruses improve on day three or four so the worst days are likely over The fever response should be abating soon Her doctor was correct Not doing anythingother than supportive careis the treatment of choice for stomach viral infections No an ingrown toenail will not cause diarrhea There are no rules in medicine that states that a person can only have one medical problem at a time or that all symtpoms have to be connect to just one condition So the diarrhea is due to something else If you are taking antibiotics for your ingrown nail then that can cause diarrhea Yesthat would be one of the more logical possibilities to account for large reactive cervical lymph nodes I am glad you are seeing an ENT I dont personally use it in my practice but some medical providers do This is from an article published by the American Academy of Family Physicians Cimetidine Tagamet is known to stimulate Tlymphocyte populations which are important in controlling viral infections At a dosage of 30 to 40 mg per kg per day it has been tried with varying success in the treatment of warts A small trial 20 in children found cimetidine to be as effective as the usual topical agents or cryotherapy Another trial 21 combining cimetidine with levamisole an immunomodulator used in the treatment of colon cancer reported cure rates of 857 percent versus 455 percent with cimetidine alone However in a more recent doubleblind study 22 cimetidine was not found to be significantly more effective than placebo in adults or children although there was a trend toward efficacy in younger patients Cimetidine or watchful waiting could be considered for use in children who cannot tolerate destructive treatment methods Viral gastroenteritis is very prevalent this time of year Please keep in mind that this is just a blind guess since I have no way of examining you The most important thing is FLUID REPLACEMENT You must stay wellhydrated Dont eat very much for a few more daysmost of these viral infections resolve in about 710 days so hang in there At least you are not vomiting so be greatful In my practice we do not treat diarrhea with drugs at least at this stage but your doctor may have other ideas Your stomach pain may be cramps or gas but if you are concerned the only way that you can be sure is to see your medical provider so you can be examined Plenty of ideas hundreds in fact but an idea is not an accurate diagnosis A diagnosis or treatment can not be accomplished blindly over the Internet You will need to see a medical provider  someone who can take a good medical history examine you firsthand order any diagnostic tests and thenprovider a treatment plan for you Constipation is HARD DRY stools My guess is that your son is not truly constipated but may be having colic or gaspains Not having a BM for one day isnt constipation A child can go a week or more without having a bowel movement or have five bowel movements a day and still be considered normal In about a month after three months things will start to improve as he gets more beneficial bacteria in his colon that help him digest the lactose and proteins in his formula You can try other formulas but things may improve soon no matter what you do Talk to his pediatrician to see if some antigas drops would be appropriate or for recommendations on a more gentle formula although he is on a good one Hang in there Momthings will improve soon I do not know anything about you or your medical history but based solely on the brief information in your question I would say that worsening painand an enlarged spleen would meet the criteria for going to the hospital instead of waiting I have never heard that cholesterol causes stomach pains Just because a cause was not readily apparent does not mean one should blame this type of pain on cholesterol The fact that he is still in pain after eating and going through Pepto Bismol is proof that he needs to have a higher level evaluation Seeing a pediatric gastroenterologist would be the way to go if his pediatrician or primary care provider is not willing to order further diagnostic tests There are so many things that could be causing this discomfort for gastritis inflammation of the stomach reflux gallbladder disease especially if your son is overweight hiatal hernia etc Appendicitis would likely cause pain in his right lower quadrant down near the right iliachip area and would not really present symptoms like you are describing If he is under stress at home or school this could be making things worse Get a referral to a gastroenterologist so that he can be properly diagnosed and treated No drinking lemon juice will NOT prevent a stomach virus The citric acid on lemons can damage teeth if you eat them excessively but in moderationyou are not likely to have a problem Lemons are high in vitamin C but many scientific studies have not proven that vitamin C prevents colds or viral infections Babies under three months old typically get lots of intestinal gas mostly because their intestinal flora the good bacteria isnt sufficient at this point Sometimes they will swallow air when they nurse but most of the time the gas is just a byproduct of all of the mothers mild lactose being digested Breast fed is best so you are giving him the proper food Simethicone found in overthecounter products like Mylicon Infant Drops can be helpful in making some of those big bubbles into tiny bubbles Talk to his pediatrician first to make sure this would be appropriate for him continue to burp him after nursing and hang in there Most gassy babies will miraculously improve after age three months Not unless the scoliosis is so severe that it deforms the rib cage unlikely You figured it outEither dont eat foods that cause constipation or take the appropriate precautions if you do Your plan of using stool softeners is just fine Yes a person can have a gastointestinal virus without vomiting or diarrhea but those symptoms are typically the things you get If you had this virus before or a similar virus you may only have a mild infection with nausea You cannot definitively diagnose a Norovirus by symptoms alone since everyone responds to a viral infection differently Atenolol is a blood pressure medication that has been used for some anxiety issues If this seems to help him in these social situations then I do think it justifies using it I dont believe he will experience any adverse effects from taking this low dose There are other medications that may be more helpful if this does not work I dont know anything about your boyfriendhis medical history his habits medications etcto be able to blindly offer treatment over the Internet for his abdominal pain While the pain could be related to gas distention from being constipated there can be NUMEROUS other considerations that can only be sorted out by a medical provider during an examination I think you are talking about PROSTATITIS  a prostate infectioninflammation that can have many causes The treatment depends on the presumed cause and the severity of your condition so it would not be wise to selftreat this problem See a urologist so you can be properly examined expertly diagnosed and treated based on those findings Gastritis from his alcohol ingestion would be high on the list of possibilities Alcohol use can lead to gastric bleeding and ulcers as well There is no way to accurately diagnose your husbands stomach burning over the Internet so I would strongly suggest that he a stop drinking and b see a medical professional to start the diagnostic process A tapeworm or gallbladder disease in a fiveyear old is extremely rare so instead of trying to diagnose her it would be best for her to see a pediatric gastroenterologist for a diagnostic workup There is really no way to blindly narrow down the many possibilties over the Internet The anus and the stomach are on opposite ends of the gastrointestinal tract  quite a distance away I would not think that an anal fissure would cause any stomach pain at least pain as a direct relationship Certainly if you are having severe anal pain this may potentially cause nonspecific constitutional symptoms upset stomach nausea headache etc but as a rule they would be considered two isolated symptoms Stomachemptying time varies from person to person but generally two hours is a reasonable average When you are ill food can stagnant in the stomach for longer periods of time or even quickly move on to the small intestines When you are having surgery they will want you NPO nothing by mouth for about 812 hours just to be sure Maybe It would not be overly harmful to eat expired yogurt or drink sour milk for that matter but expiration dates are there to insure freshness of the product and safety There are many reasons for a child to vomit but that yogurt may have been contributory Vomiting is one way for your body to get rid of an offending substance so maybe most of the yogurt was expelled The next step would be to see a gastoenterlogist  someone that can visually inspect your stomach with a fiberoptic scope or at least run some additional diagnostic tests Medications used to block or reduce your stomach acid or an antispasmotic medication taken prior to meals would be one treatment consideration once you are properly diagnosed No the stomach is likely in the right place and not put in backwards Talk to the surgeonthere is likely another reason you are seeing this difference Yes this is possible Lymph nodes react enlarge and become tender in response to inflammation and Shingles can certainly do that I dont have a clue what your doctor meant by that statement My suggestion would be for you to ask him to comment on this finding One can control postnasal drainage by using an antihistamine but I do not know anything about you or your medical history to know if this would be recommended for you since the underlying CAUSE has not been determined The brownish mucous is a a concern and could indicate a sinus infection so it would be wise for you to see your medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated Try a few nights without the orange juice and then try it again If you do find a connection then just dont give OJ at night For most people this would not be an issue but it may be for you and your child Freezing does not necessarily kill germsbut baking those cookies in a hot oven certainly can While germs can remain viable on certain objects for hours or even days I would not think that your hard work making cookies would put others at risk You can send them to meIll eat em Nothis is not normal You may have a rectal prolapse I would suggest that you see a proctologist rectal specialist for an examination Orsomething very serious is happening When you have a bleeding area in the stomach the hydrochloric acid will turn it jet blackand this will cause tarry stools I have no idea if this is the underlying reason but it would be in your best interest to see a medical provider right away to determine if this black stool is blood or not Another possibility would be Pepto Bismolif you were taking it Without the ability to examine you first hand I would have no way of determing the reason for your symptoms but I can tell you that there are many arteries in the abdominal cavity that pulsates as well as intestinal parestalsis the rhythmic movement of the colonnot unlike a snake moving If your doctor cannot find a reason consider seeing a different medical provider for a second opinion or ask for an abdominal ultrasound Probably but I do not know any of your medical history I can tell you that Benadryl has been known to effect your REM dream state sleep so people who routinely use this antihistamine as a sleep aid do not sleep as deeply as they should Talk to your medical provider There may be some better alternative for you to get a more restful sleep Teething is a process and getting that first tooth can take longer in some children The lack of drooling is really not clinically significant but if he is having loose stools he could be a bit dehydrated A dry mouth lack of tears and less wet diapers would indicate that he needs more fluids If he does have a mild stomach bug it doesnt appear that it would be too bad since he is acting well Just treat any discomfort if you notice it and make sure the gets plenty of fluids OtherwiseI suspect he will be fine You need to get to the ER now With your medical history it is not that important when you started bleeding but rather HOW MUCH you are bleeding right now A rapid bleed in the stomach could cause black stools relatively fast Because you are weak and out of breath it would not be wise to delay an immediate medical evaluation Not a virusit is a bacteria called  If she is not feeling betterlike her old self in a few more days the medical provider is really obligated to run a series of diagnostic tests to ascertain the reason for her fatigue Clinician often wait a week before running diagnostic tests since viruses a common reason usually last this long Some viruses however like mononucleosis can last much longer She also needs to be checked for anemia Prenatal vitamins are fine to take even if you are not pregnant or wanting to be Vitamins are not a substitute for good nutrition and regular exercise so please do this as well You didnt mention the name of the stomach med you were taking so I dont know how to advise you for that part of your question but if you are not going to attempt to conceive until next year you can problem keep taking the stomach medication until that time Ask your doctor for specific advice I dont think that the penny will cause in corrosive response but it is concerning that it is still in the stomach and has not travelled to the intestinal tract after 10 days At some point in the near future if the penny still remains in the stomach it may need to be removed under sedation using a gastroscope I bet that you want to know why since a daily stomachache is problematic Unfortunately since I do not know anything about you your medical history or have any way of examining you or ordering some diagnostic tests you will need to see a medical provider There is not way for me or any medical provider to be able to blindly diagnose you over the Internet based solely on one sentence Sorry If you have classic signs of appendicitisworsening right lowerquadranat abdominal paintenderness then why wait In the past we would watch patients in the ER for several hours but now the diagnostic test of choice is an abdominal CT scan Most medical professionals would prefer that you do not wait I dont know if you are male or female but women would also need to consider ovarian or tube problems that could cause similar pain A CT would rule this out as well Milk is primarily a liquid that contains water You can use it for some not all of a recommended water intakekeeping in mind that milk is FOOD and has considerably more calories and nutrients than water You will need to see your medical provider  someone who knows YOU and your medical history and someone who has the ability to examine you first hand It would not be possible to determine a specific cause of YOUR stomach ache blindly over the Internet let alone treat it I have no way of blindly determining if you are pregnant over the Internet so I would suggest that you repeat the pregnancy test in a week to see if the results are more definitive or call your medical provider to order a moresensitive blood pregnancy test Dont be too anxious If you are pregnant you will be pregnant for quite a while If you are not pregnant you should know in a few more weeks when the tests fail to show evidence of a pregnancy Usually not Leg cramps are due to spasm of skeletal muscles the stomach cramps are smooth muscles an entirely different system Not all cases of cirrhosis are the same so this very difficult question is best addressed to your mothers doctor  someone who knows your mothers case but even doctors may not have that answer for you My heart goes out to you your mother and your family Your first and most important step is to see a medical professional so that you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated It appears that your problem is gastrointestinal so if your primary care medical provider cannot help you a referral to a gastroenterologist would get you on the road to recovery I am sure I am surprised that you have waited five months to get this problem evaluated Yesit will make your abdomen HUGE Ice cream is high in fat and calories so keep it in moderation It will not damage your stomach but gaining a lot of weight may damage your selfesteem Obviously without the ability to examine your son firsthand I would not be able to provide you with a definitive answer but if those little pimplelike bumps are firm and pearly and have a tiny belly button umbilication in the center you have to look very very close then they may be molluscum contagiosum  You can do an Internet or WebMD search for more information and some pictures Molluscum are very common viral wartlike skin lesions found in children I treat them with liquid nitrogen freeze them or use a chemical blistering agent called cantharidin Your son should first be properly diagnosed by his pediatrician or primary care medical provider It would not be wise to try and treat them over the counter until you have a definitive diagnosis If you do have a jaundice a yellowing of the skin and the whites of your eyes then it is not likely from a stomach infectionespecially one that you had two YEARS ago Usually liver or gall bladder problems can do this but you did not mention anything about jaundice in your postingjust the heading It is not possible to blindly determine the reason for your weakness and your fever three days ago so I would strongly suggest that you see a medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated It would be extremely unlikely if not impossible for you to become pregnant from the scenario that you have described but if you and your boyfriend are already experimenting in sexual play it may only be a matter of time before one or your activities sexual exploits progresses to a point where you will face a real risk of an unwanted pregnancy Lots of things can cause an itchy rashthousands of diseases and conditions in fact You and your sister need to be medical examined so that you can be properly diagnosed and treated  not something that can be accomplished over the Internet Yes that can happen It is called a perforation Hopefully if you have an ulcer you are on some appropriate medications Vomiting yellow liquid is just gastric secretionsit does not mean your ulcer has burst It doesnt A stomach virus infection can occur anytime day or night It just happened to show up at night in YOU Not very likely Umbilical hernias  at least the small ones  are usually asymptomatic Eight weeks of nausea is not likely related to an umbilical hernia so keep looking for the causereason Dont let your doctors throw in the towel The transit time is quite variable in all peoplethere are no set times Food can remain in the stomach for two hours or so then progressively travel into the intestinal tract where it may process for several hoursor days In babies the transit time is surprisingly rapid Babies often poop while you are feeding them In some adults the transit time can be days especially in older people or people prone to constipation Transit time can be influenced by the type of food ingested the volumesize of meal the amount of waterfluids and the amount of fibersolids Spicy food may be faster than you anticipated A heavy Thanksgiving dinner may bloat you for a day or more Just about all one month olds have fussy periods so dont read too much in to it Thrush is not that painful As long as she is nursing or taking a bottle it should be fine Either amount is fine on the nystatinI give my patients one ml on each side of their mouth about four times a day the medication is very safe It should not upset her tummy but she could have an upset tummy from a bit of colic It is okay to give Tylenol at the proper dosage for her weight if you think she needs it We have a saying in medicine Gone is Good Now that your pain has completely resolved it is debatable whether a handson medical visit would reveal the true cause It is really up to you whether to seek care or not I used to be like that I bought ultimate flora 50 billion critical probiotic at vitamin shop its wonderful I went through this with my own son We decided to take him off of Concerta  pills for adHd Tried the Feingold diet  saw great improvement But you have to be a stickler to the healthier nutritional plan Its tough but we put all the kids on it Diet isnt magic but it made us feel like it was I hope after 3 days you are either feeling better or have gone to see someone If your BM is quite bloody you should see someone soon If it isnt too bloody a doctor visit or urgent care center would be okay There are a couple of bacterial infections that produce bloody diarrhea You MAY need an antibiotic YES  I am not a doctor but do have liver cirrhosis You need to get to a liver doctor ASAP This is called ascites and is caused by your liver not fuctioning properly They may put you on water pills or drain the fluid If you have gotton to this point please seek medical attention now You need to be evaluated as there are many other effects of liver disease that are of concern The sooner you are treated the better I eventually had a procedure done called TIPS which helped me a great deal if you are a candidate for this I would recommend it Not sure what you mean by a spot but please seek help NOW Hope this is helpful and you can be helped soon Good luck and God bless SILKY61 check with your doctor but mineral oil worked better for my son Definitely sounds like it could be an ulcer Id talk to your parents and get to the doctor i also have a loss of appetite After reading your whole post sounded like if I were typing it I had all your symptoms for as long as I can remember Tried everything for gas and bloating even Probiotics with little to no comfort After convincing my Dr I was tested for H pylori Helicobacter pylori Look it up after reading about it I told myself this couldnt be it me having a bacteria that is possible to contract through food and water being higher rates in developing countries But the symptoms of always feeling bloated even on a empty stomach convinced me to get my Dr on board for the testing I had the Urea breath test done which is a test used to check for the presence of a gas produced by the bacteria I had a positive test result and after treatment symptoms went away You need to schedule an appointment with a GI

to have a period while pregnant I never had that happen to be however i have heard that its not uncommon I would take a pregnancy test and see what it says and if says u arent go to the doctor Is the bleeding like your normal periods Prednisone definitely causes swelling and minimal weight gain You should call your surgeon and ask to either cut your dosage in half or consider a different medication Do you have a history of ulcers Sounds like classic ulcerative conditions You should try not drinking coffee or smoking both of which can aggravate the pain You may also need to see a gastric specialist You might check for Shingles I know you are only 18 but I know several young people that have had it In some cases you have the pain before you see any rash or blisters I was one of

cellulite with the number of treatments like swimming walking weight training there are also number of spa treatments and laser treatments and endermologie treatment which can healp you to get rid of cellulite But the question is that these method help you to get rid of cellulite permanently because many people complain that after taking those costly treatments they are not able to vanish those cellulite completely Here I know and used a cream few months ago which helps me to recover the cellulite permanantly till now and is very reasonable which is within your budget you can use revitashape cream it is really very effective The best thing would be to seek a urologist They can run tests to determine what is going on That is a high protein count and my first thought is infection especially since I have chronic infections But see a specialist not only for a second opinion but because they know much more about urinary and testicular problems My advice would be a change in diet and if this has been going on for awhile like more than 36 hours to see a doctor In could be a lot of minor or even serious problems with your stomach A pregnancy test only reacts to the pregnancy hormone human chorionic gonadotropin HCG However if you are pregnant this hormone will not be present in your urine or blood until 13 to 16 days after ovulation the release of an egg which is around the time that you would normally get your period Until this time has passed it will not be possible to see a positive result in a pregnancy test Urine tests require a certain level of HCG to be present in order to indicate a positive pregnancy result Blood tests are more sensitive because they can detect a smaller amount of HCG which means that pregnancies can be picked up earlier usually between six to eight days after ovulation You can have a blood test at your GP surgery but it is recommended that you take a home urine test before booking an appointment Source  Pharmacysell There are positive

concern about the loose skin is a common one in an individual who has lost a great deal of weight sometimes quickly While your skin is adaptable it can take quite a bit of time for it to return to its more firm suppleness after experiencing weight loss as you have done Try not to expect it to get better overnight or even in a couple of weeks Youre young enough that it is not necessarily recommended to seek surgery to take care of the excess skin If it continues to be a problem after several months you could discuss it But Im sure you will find that by that time it will be much better In the

intolerance and your doctor will help you determine if it is lactase enzymes are a common option As Im sure you know lactose intolerance refers to those who  You can either take it before you consume dairy products or you can mix it into milk and take it at the same time Be sure you discuss any medications including over the counter meds like multivitamins and painkillers or other medical conditions with your physician Throwing a new medication or supplement can potentially cause side effects or even inhibit the effectiveness of medications youre currently taking If you have an interest in doing so another option is to consume foods either lactose free soy milk or specially made for lactose intolerant consumers such as Lacteeze Lacteeze is advantageous because you still get high levels of calcium while avoiding lactose Soy milk is a viable alternative but has much less calcium than either dairy milk rice milk or almond milk Or you could have regular dairy milk with lactase enzymes While Prilosec or Gavisconor even PeptoBismolmight help the reflux as well as the stomach pain if you have chronic pain when eating there is a possibility that you might have a peptic ulcer Generally pain increases whenever food is consumed ie when your body initially begins production of gastric acids in order to start digesting your food and can be excruciating Have you been sexually active since stopping your birth control and if so did you use another method of contraception If you havent been sexually active youre not pregnant This sounds like concern and if your HPTs have been negative your best bet is to get to a physician and find out whats going on Is this your first time taking birth control and did you have a period during the first month of your pills When in your cycle did you have unprotected sex If it wasnt in the first month first pack of your pills it seems unlikely that you are pregnant since most pills provide contraceptive protection after the first month If you jumped from one pill pack into another ie skipping to avoid a period this can play with your cycle a bit I would contact a physician but if you didnt have unprotected sex in the first three weeks of your first pill pack pregnancy is unlikely You have to drink water Water has lots of amazing benefits to our bodies Aside from the fact that it can ease gastroenteritis stomach

makes it so that the muscles in your GI tract dont contact as muchoften as they would normally Typically Drs will prescribe a mild stool softener to help with this drink water chamomile tea Sounds like a bacterial infection Get an antibiotical ointment or cream for the penis Give it five day to a week to heal Also dont wash the penis with soap I know that you wish to teach him cleanliness but there is a possibility that soap could be caught between the penis and the foreskin causing bacteria to build up Warm water on a cloth is good penis health Keep a relationship with your pediatric doctor just in case the ointment or cream does not help Congrats you are preg but to be sure have a talk with doctor also  i have tried chacoal pills and seemed to work for me find at vitamin stores

different pill I ask your doctor to do a ct scan of your stomach You want to make shore the inside and the outside of the stomach is good A couple of things I found this information in an article  on the symptoms of heart burn Many people have different acid refluxrelated heartburn triggers but most people have similar heartburn symptoms A burning feeling in the chest just behind the breastbone that occurs after eating and lasts a few minutes to several hours Chest pain especially after bending over lying down or eating Burning in the throat  or hot sour acidic or saltytasting fluid at the back of the throat Difficulty swallowing Feeling of food sticking in the middle of the chest or throat Heartburn may cause chronic cough sore throat or chronic hoarseness Reporting these symptoms is usually all that is needed for your doctor to make the diagnosis of heartburn However your doctor may perform special tests to determine the severity of your problem or to monitor your treatment Special tests may also be needed if you have unusual symptoms such as weight loss or suffer from the complications of GERD  httpwwwwebmdcomheartburngerdguideheartburnsymptoms I hope this helps Sounds like typical diarrhea to me You should maybe revel in the fact that its just once a year You might want to try and think through what you ate or drank when this happened in the past and stay away from those things If it totally makes you sad you should talk to your doctor It sounds like you have been diagnosed with acid reflux If you look at some of the symptoms there may be some overlap with IBS but just cause you have acid reflux doesnt mean you have IBS httpwwwwebmdcomheartburngerdguideacidrefluxsymptoms I hope this helps Yesif it is something simple greatbut if it is the beginning of something more serious earlier intervention will save you stress and her suffering Have you had your Thyroid checked Have you gainedlost weight Hmmm you could or your body could just be changing im

MotrinIbuprofin that is causing the bleeding that doesnt sound right Hernia  maybe He needs to see a pediatrician I had gastritis and an ulcer and that was a symptom I have had the problem for a while and it has gotten worse with age Mild cramping is normal in early pregnancy If the bleeding gets heavier or the crams get worse I would call you OB right away Trust your gut I you feel its something bad then call Good luck Sounds like you could be going through menopause Either way you should get a check up by your gyno and rule out some things stress produces gas by way of tightening the stomach walls Perhaps you need to find a way to express that anger perhaps talking with someone Diet Pepsi helps a lot as well take pepto bismol take pepto bismol Yes there are so many different types of flucold bugs out there that if your immune system is compromised it is easier to catch another one I suggest starting taking a vitiman C supplment and increase fluids to help flush your system Elizabeth is right If its part of your history to go that many times in a day then I wouldnt be too worried about itI used to have to go only once per day and now I go 3x everydayIt was something to get used to so I totally understand how it can get in the way of work I feel your pain but Ive learned you have to be intune with your body and pay attention to what it needs Needing to go is a basic biological need and no one is going to stop you if you gave to go I believe this is a sign of too much fiber intake If you are taking supplements I suggest you stop or lower the amount t youre taking because those supplements can actually Mae you very gassy Since there is only one spot And it sounds like it is infected since there is puss coming from it It does sound like a spider bite Applying some antibiotic ointment on it should help The dog may try to lick it off Just keep applying it 23 times daily If it is just a average spider bit it should start getting smaller However if it was a recluse spider it could get worse And a hole will open up with more infection If this happens see a vet And get a antibiotic shot to get it into the blood stream faster There are a lot of over the counter medications for your condition And they do help I would suggest you ask your Pharmacist for the best one to fit your problem Yes this is very normal I believe When i was pregnant I had this same problem and the only thing that worked for me was to drink a glass of cold water and to eat a small amount of mustard I am not an MD Are your sure you dont have severe acid reflux Also I suffered from ulcers for years not sure if they show up on ultrasound or not but ulcers made it painful to eat any solid foods but liquids were generally okay if you do end up having an ulcer I would suggest a 2 week treatment of Prilosec OTC I did one treatment five years ago and havent had a single problem since Its possible you have Food poisoning or Gastroenteritis If you have diarrhea for over a week call your doctor I would also question an ulcer My 7 year old had the same problem off and on all year Her doctor prescribed an acid reflux medicine She also recently tested positive for hpylori which can cause ulcers I would suggest keeping a food journal of what she eats and scheduling an appointment with a doctor warm water and a few drops of corn syrup or 2 tbl spoons of sugar Dont put too much sweets or baby will have a blowout and the mess is not pretty  mom of 2 Have you been to the dentist It could be an abscessed tooth in your upper jaw i hope she is old enough but she can be pregnant and if she is not then it can only mean one thing she sick and need medical attention immediately it can be an appendix bursting or it can be kidney failure if i were you id take her to ER now I would get my gallbladder checked Ventral Hernia i have the same thing an i done some research and i am pretty sure it is a Ventral Hernia but i will no very soon for a have made an appointment for my family doctor and i will post the results on here for you good luck to you and i hope its fixable i read about it and with surgery it can be fixed but dont leave it too long ok cheers and talk to you soon

no vomitting The best thing to do is to consult a doctor What is the answer to my question about pain front to back lower left quadrant of front Make sure you dont have h pilori causing ulcers I was just treated You have alot of options here as its so early but it wouldnt show up yet it takes 23 weeks for the best most sensitive tests to pick up the hgc hormone in your pee which tells you if you are pregnant or not Itchy nipples can be hormonal sue to your period or even not related just a body wash or friction from clothes could do that Well its either your appendix had mine removed at the ER visit or it could be gallstones Id say its more likely to be your gallbladder and a flare upgallstones My family has history of gallstonesgallbladder issues and both my parents have their gallbladder and appendix removed My mom had the same symptoms you had and went to the ER after her pain was so bad and had an emergency removal of her gallbladder Hope you find the answers you need Have you always been this way If yes then it could be Celiac SEEleeak disease A digestive condition triggered by consumption of the protein gluten which is primarily found in bread pasta cookies pizza crust and many other foods containing wheat barley or rye People with celiac disease who eat foods containing gluten experience an immune reaction in their small intestines causing damage to the inner surface of the small intestine and an inability to absorb certain nutrients Celiac disease can cause abdominal pain and diarrhea sounds a lot like what i am having myself i dont really have any concrete answers but from recent research i have done and the fact that you mention the yellowish stool a semieducated guess on my part would be something to do with your pancreas Two basic possibilities a food poisoning or what is sometimes called stomach flu and b some more lasting problem Either way you need to stay hydrated and go see a doctor Actually you need to see a gastroenterologist GI doctor who specializes in digestive issues and diseases I wouldnt jump to celiacs because celiacs is a fairly rare condition Much more likely that you have some form of inflamatory bowel disease I would suggest seeing a GI doc as soon as possible Youll need a colonoscopy in order to get a better idea of whats actually going on I think you feel bloated most of the times This may be due to lack of thyroid hormones which may cause some other symptoms like sluggishness fatigue constipation etc If you have a confirmed diagnosis of thyroid deficiency better consult a endocrinologistfamily physician who will put you on appropriate medicine like Synthroid Levothyroxine this will better your condition for sure I agree with all the information provided by Maryann Other than that eating spicy and dry foods may cause bloating and flatulence caffeine can cause heart burn and upset stomach This may be an infection but its better for you to go to the doctor if you havent already because the only way to have a centain answer is by excamining you None at all I am an adult with add and I was always sick to my stomach taking Ritalin I lost 17 pounds and felt agitated most of the time I stopped using Ritalin and started taking a product that my neighbors daughter was having good success with So I started taking the flavay got my weight back and no more nausea Sometimes I have gas but I dont think its related I think I snack too much anyway thats what my wife says Sounds like food poisoningfrom undercooked food I would seek medical treatment If it grows rapidly in size and is extremely hard and painful it could be MRSA or Staph infection However if it is staying the same size it may just be an ingrown hair Ingrown hairs can get infected and become staph so make sure you clean it and not mess with it no Yes you can have a rise in temperature as your body is trying to cope with it but it just cant quite do it so yes there will be a rise drink lots of water and if gets worse i would immediately go up to the emergency cause if you are to dehydrated and can make you not very well and they can put a drip in and give you fluids Test again and if its still negative go get checked out could be stress causing it or something else Just keep at it Diets take time to progress and it is good that you have been cutting sugar and fats while doing some physical exercise I am not sure if you consume alcohol or anything that has loaded calories but those should be avoided as well The way I work my diet is on Sunday after eating healthy all week I reward myself with pizza ice cream bar or something tasty I would recommend you keep watching your diet since that is 75 of losing weight and absolutely do not eat any trans fats such as any fast food place because that will take you back about a week Your saturated fats are the next on the list and should be significantly cut down to about half of your body weight Keep getting mono and polyunsaturated fats because they are completely natural and can be found in almonds seeds and fish Some healthy foods on my diet include rice greek yogurt chicken not breaded fish almonds pasta oatmeal and eggs Eggs are great in the morning because they contain the amino acid carnitine which helps your body turn fat into energy I usually wake up and drink a coffee for a boost in metabolism and also take a green tea capsule because it is a natural fat burner The next point of focus is your workout program Instead of doing a 3 mile walk you should really look into High Intensity Interval Training This process speeds your body up boosting your metabolism drastically for 1224 hours and that will help you lose weight This requires very tiring exercises that are performed at a fast and hard level There are other exercises for abs that work 200 better than crunches If you are trying to lose stomach fat you should do higher reps at a fast pace as another boost of metabolism Planks side planks oblique sit ups bicycles and mason twist will hit all of your abdominal muscles much better than crunches as they only focus on upper central abdominals Keep doing yoga because that is a great trick for relaxation and helping muscles out Also womens weights fluctuates a lot with menstruation so dont go to the scale more than once a week Remember losing weight takes time as most people on the proper diet and exercise program will lose a couple pounds a month Eat healthy and keep at it Hope this helps Please take your child to the Emergency Room as soon as possible if you havent done so already Pain in the back and stomach could be a variety of things He could have Appendicitis a bowel blockage a GI tract infection any number of things but with the vomiting fever and pain as you described it could be something very serious and you shouldnt wait any longer Better to be safe than sorry Good luck with your little one I will say a prayer for you all you may want to check it at a free clinic It can be caused by many things I had vertigo from a medication I was on once The ER doctor asked me if the room felt like it was spinning or did I feel like I was spinning He explained that usually if the cause is from the neck up inner ear ear infection etc you will feel like the room is spinning and if the cause is from the below the neck such as cardiac issues you feel like youre spinning Some of your symptoms are also those of diabetes If the room is spinning you can take Meclizine OTC check with a pharmacist if you are taking other medications If the problem is inner ear or an ear infection this should help your symptoms If it doesnt help or your symptoms get worse you should probably see a doctor to rule out more serious conditions Do you detox your system every season three to four times a year also are you drinking plenty of water and watch what you eat I would say it is due to your food digesting I have lower abdominal cramps Have been taking antibiotics and now I have a black stool Is this normal for this it varies in women i had miscarriage and i think my cramps after the surgery was a few days stomach bigger feeling movement in upper stomach period regular are you sure the period are regular and are you sure the tubes are secure i heard stories on i didnt know i was pregnant that women got tubes tied and still end up pregnant but that is my best guess other than that i do not know what else it could be probably better check with your doctor you should go to your dr for a blood pregnancy test they are more accurate and some women get negative results from home pregnancy tests Ask your doctor about diverticulitis im currently in the same boat as youugh and i find that instant plain oatmeal with bananas and yogurt with canned peaches and bananas work welli am a die hard coffee drinker but i try hard to stay away from iti bought boxes of pudding and jelloand some lite cool whip to go with itim not a fan of sugar so i stay with the lite stuffand im not starvinggood luck Its not heartburn this a way different pain then heartburn feed her prunes or some other laxative Do you mean Bile by any chance NO COULD be jaundice but id just go to your doctor to get a more accurate diagnosis get your apendix checked out Close your eyes and pray is all I can think of Hope this dosent happen Take care I remember my mother complaining about this same thing everyday for 3 years What I can tell you is that my mother was type 2 diabetic and had lung cancer She recently died in May 2012 I am not assuming that her food lodging or feeling lodged was associated with her lung cancer however it may have something to do with her being a diabetic She was never able to get an answer from her doctor to what may be causing it I sometimes feel guilty because there were times I thought she was just using that for an excuse not to eat I was worried because she was losing weight Thats why when I read your question it just immediately jumped out at me My answer to you would be to get your sugar tested And whatever you do dont ever give up on finding an answer because it could be something serious Hope you are better soon This could be caused from a pulled muscle Using ice for 20 minutes followed by heat for 20 minutes may relieve this pain If this does not seem to help contact your MD Good luck My son went through this same thing when he was younger the doctor ran all sorts of tests and did the IV antibiotics and no change If your daughter is sleeping a lot along with the other symptoms have her doctor check for mono disease This is what my son was diagnosed with and it took a month and a half after diagnoses for it to go away Also try the mixture of ibuprofen and Tylenol together for the fever I hope she feels better soon Good luck COULD BE A NUMBER OF THINGS SUGGEST SEEING GASTROLOGIST AS SOON AS POSSIBLE MOST LIKELY COLONOSCOPY AND ENDOSCOPY UPPER GI WILL BE SUGGESTED THIS IS TO CHECK BOTH SYMPTONS TO EITHER RULE OUT OR VERIFY A CONDITIONS Its the Pepto It happens to me every time I take it and if you read all the warnings on the package it even says you may notice a change in your stool color Nothing to be too alarmed by but if youre still taking the Pepto try laying off for a day or two and see if that helps I think you need to see a doctor after 3 weeks of vomiting This sounds like more then the flu or gastroenteritis Could you possibly be pregnant I suggest seeing your doctor or going to the ER where they can run tests Good Luck and hope you feel better soon Ive read a lot lately about how this could be caused by hi stomach acidity related to body pH levels My suggestion is u get pH levels checked and if below 70 pl chk not too sure of the fig u are too acidic and need to set that right It will need expert opinion I can suggest a website which claims to deal with this successfully and has a lot of commonsense advice to boot Look up Sherry brescia at wwwgreattastenopaincom i have a period calculator that tracks my period ive always had a normal period thats why this is bothering me this was helpful though im gonna just have to go to my doctor short answer not usually might wanna get checked out by a doc hope that this helps could this be a hernia yes if there is a muscle you worked you did tear it She should be fine depends on the location and intensity of the hit to be on the safeside I would suggest she sees her dr to make sure the baby is fine You need to visit a Gastroenterologist to classify what type of disease you have this may be a serious Gastrointestinal disease that depends on the location of his penis and how much sperm was ejaculated however it is very unlikly That is okay but you have to make sure that you are also eating other foods that contain

pain started and we had these square floor scooters Well a friend was pulling me around on one using a jump rope I went extremely fast the rope broke and I went hurtling into the cement wall smashing my left side on it My entire left side bruised and was swollen for a while I think that during that injury I might have slightly fractured a rib or something I didnt go to the hospital after the injury so I dont know and maybe when it healed it healed slightly out of place In the part where it hurts there is a red line going straight across where the skin is actually pinched in I dont remember exactly when the pain started but I feel like this must have been the time since it was several years back Does this sound right Even if that was the issue how could it even be resolved Thats how my stomach flu virus started Good luck Yes the tests for celiac have a lot of reasons for potential false negatives  not eating gluten until right up to the test is one of them sounds like it

thing that gave me great work out and didnt injur me 4 star advice good luck You might want to go to a doctor to see whats going on Although a virus can last up to a week or 2 its a good idea to get a

Chrones disease if it is that bad have someone take you to a doctor hope you feel better Just wanted to add That I have seen my doctor yesterday I didnt think to ask him whether I should be off of work He did mention that this may take a week to recover from My pregnancy test came back negative as well I would go to the dr and get a pregnancy test done BC is not always effective Dont know I would buy one of those pregnancy tests and try it I hope you arent pregnant but you need to find out what is going on Do a pregnancy test and then go to a doctor Best wishes for a speedy recovery If you are having constipation or bowel movements with it it could just be IBS Drink lots of water and increase your fiber intake Go to a doctor and get it check out to be on the safe side Antibiotics are great for getting rid of infections but they also get rid of good bacteria in your stomach Probiotics replace that good bacteria Even though I am not a doctor I took antibiotics for almost 2 years and it has helped me greatly to take a daily probiotic I am feeling good Sounds like pancreatitiswhen you have the pain go immediately to the doctor It is difficult for them to diagnose it unless you are having an attack My husband is experiencing the same thing The doctor told him when he has an episode go straight to the clinic and get a blood test and a scan He has a standing order for both You may want to ask your doctor for the same thing so the next time you have a flair up you can get the tests done that day sounds like it could also be kindey stones  either way if the pain gets worse or of u begin to have pain when u pee call the doctor  if u have fear to go maybe justa consult can let u know weither its something to go in for  hope u feel better if your trying to gain weight  taking on carbs  good carbs is a good idea as long as you workout they should stay in your belly  just be sure to eat the most carbs in the daytime  so your body can break them down and use them for engery  if eatten later in the day or night time your body will store them as fat im 52 110 i finally just got myself up to that weight  i was always very skinny  no hypothyrid just nautrally  by doing just

asap  a back up like that can posion your body and make u very very sick hope this helps feel better How is your skin Any yellow tint If so go to the doctor right away You may have jaundice which means something is affecting your liver functions I just got back from Arizona where I helped my friend who had similar problems She was pre diabetic her kidneys were bleeding she had parasites and amoebas She was overweight had fibromyalgia and no energy She couldnt work anymore She took some supplements that I take one is just for energy its called Vitality by Pharmanex You can get it at wwwscannsedreamscom She also started taking a Nano Pack same site Its a vitamin packet you take twice a day Some of the antioxidants are nano sized that means very small so they get in your cellsMy friend is 30lbs lighter and working two jobs now Hope that helps The thing I love about this company is their quality and purity of the products My friend is a walking testimony There are many reasons why you could have stomach pain after eating and nausea Some diagnosis are serious and need medical attention right away I would schedule an appointment with your doctor ASAP Be prepared with a complete list of symptoms and see if you can identify potential triggers ie certain foods beverages time of day frequency duration etc The more information you can provide your doctor up front the faster he might be able to give you a diagnosis and treatment Im wondering why this appears under Ulcer Have you been diagnosed with Ulcers before try excersizeing more fast oftenand harder I have had ever test there is upper gi ct scan and colonoscopy everything is normal next step is the nervo team thats why Im lost on whats wrong with me Right now my husband is going through the same thing they cant find anything either  With blood present an imbalance of hormones could be the problem I experienced something along those lines without the added pain My doctor told me to get in to see her asap  no one should experience blood during menopause An adjustment of my prescription hormone therapy was diagnosed I have experienced this on several occasions Once is was related to new medication I began taking The next it was associated with stress and one other time it was the early symptoms of gallbladder stones The symptoms also resemble gallbladder kidney or bladder stones however these should have already been ruled out with a CAT Scan My mother diabetic experienced something as that which lasted quiet awhile she lost a significant amount of weight during her sickness Doctors were also stunned and diagnosed something as gastritis Researching the web of her symptomsI found that she was probably experiencing an inflammation of the outer lining of her stomach She was given antibiotics from her doctor which was appropriate however I advised a change in diet until better Her symptoms lasted for several months The nausea prevented her from eating as she should resulting in a unhealthy weak appearance There was significant sporadic work loss during that time Antibiotics were prescribed at least twice as I remember The one thing I have learned of the medical field is that they are forever making mistakes and usually it is good to rely on your own thoughts and those of family and friends Never ever hesitate to get a second or third opinion If your doctor is located in a small town seek out a professional in the closest large city as the state capital or one of its size It seems the most knowledgeable and creative doctors practice in larger cities One last thought Not knowing more information the thought of an appendix problem popped to mind  I am not one to vomit unless deathly sick however when experiencing PMS my belief is that anything can happen It reminds me of the menopause I experience now Fever is usually related to some type infection either bacteria or viral Hives or rash Hives is a dangerous symptom to have and a doctor should be consulted Stomach pain could be many different problems These symptoms seems related to asthma or COPD A doctor should be consulted Another possibility could be sleep apnea do you snore while sleeping It too is an issue that needs professional attention Speaking to a medical practitioner has to be the best thing that you have to advise your daughter Do an action now before it is too late It is just like the same quick action that you have to do in dealing with unwanted fats You can also check out wwwbodytreatmentcentercom for a fat removal in NYC I had same problem and found out it was my thyroid I gained 56 lbs in 4 weeks have some blood drawn but tell ur doctor to test ur thyroid There are 75 of americans who have thyroid disease and it goes untested try that and congrats on the new baby God Bless and hope this help u out to ease ur mind some I had same signs your having I still have my gallbladder still The pain and Bowel problems were sometimes embarible then I had a colonoscopy and the specialist found out that I had Hpyloria Bacteria and actually had sores in my stomach and small intestine ducts so he put me on Nexium and the acid reflux is way better the stomach pains better and my food is digesting now it wouldnt digest just sit in my stomach for days and rot and thats were the stomach pain and bowel problems came in hope this helps ya out God Bless Have your doctor go over your previous last test and blood work my doctor said most doctors dont know or think to look for the HPyloria disease until brought to the attention Best of Luck and prayers for ya I had a close friend who had same problem with her son who at time was 3 years old now 5 years old I told her to give him Lactose and Glucotin free foods stop all daily vitamins he might be taking Pedlite that first thing in the morning small 4oz to start with Decrease all spices in his food to almost none No fried food at all If you go to your grocery market get the Gerber Graduates for him but dont let him see it cause hes a big boy not a baby and will not eat if he sees the baby food jar Best of luck to you and your son I had to raise my friends son for almost 2 years cause she couldnt handle him being in pain with or without food So me being in medical field and having 5 medical degrees didnt mind hes all better now and back with his momma now with an ultra sound they can tell at about 2 12 weeks With a test it can pick up as early as 4 weeks Try taking iron supplements your levels may be low You could look into the possibility of a gluten or wheat allergy since many high fiber foods contain gluten andor wheat Otherwise try something that relieves gas as high fiber diets can cause gas buildup No Period issueare you menopausal or could be I would research effects of various stomach problemsperiod issues on net in case it is caused by some food issue Also antibiotics will do thisprobiotics might fix Yogurt and other food with good bacteria might help Have you tried gas removal things like GasX Hey you never knowno insurance here so I try everything I can before seeing Drso expensive Good luck Your symptoms arent very specific What side is the pain on and is it high or low what other symptoms You might be stressed especially worrying over whether or not you are pregnant Are your periods always regular Try not thinking about it If you dont get your period within a week or if you need to settle your mind go buy a pregnancy test I dont know which one would be better Just go to the store look and pick the one that works best for you Considering you had your baby in February I am assuming that your placenta was removed shortly therafter If so it is quite a few months afterwards so you shouldnt have any bruising You would have notice bruising shortly after having your placenta removed Since you have the bloating I would follow up with your physician You may want to have the doctors check you for Gastroparesis Diabetics are more prone to get it but I just found out I have it and had it before I became type two diabetic It causes problems with the emptying of your stomach some medications like proton pump inhibitors can cause an increased heart rate though I have psoriasis I cannot see my back But the symptoms sound the same Sweating and getting hot increases it Try a cool bath or shower with oatmeal soak See a dermatologist dont eat too much white rice it is not so healthy it is like white bread so limit your intake of white rice and you will feel better it is as easy as that i do not know the answer i am trying to figure it out myself you should probably go see a doctor and make sure you take a sample of that with you so that the doctor can check that outadn if he cant help you then i dont know what you could do my daughter had a feeding tube for almost 2 years because she refused to eat 90 of the time when she would get sick is if the food was going into her belly too fast maybe if you try slowing down feedings and give less more often it could help that way the body has to work less hard to try to digest what is going inso instead of say 20 oz in 5 mins every hr try 10 oz every 10 mins every hour and a half It can be very serious and gastroenteritis lasting more than a week really should be assessed by a physician Most food poisoning will resolve in a HEALTHY adult within a week If you go more than that you run the risk of throwing off electrolytes your body minerals salt potassium magnesium and so on You can suffer some cardiac events without the proper balance of minerals If you have bloody diarrhea this should always be assessed by physician Blood in vomit could indicate an ulcer bowel movement with coffee grind look indicates digested bloodulcer or intestinal bleed Is she on antibiotics Amoxicillan is an antibiotic that can cause rash Its not necessarily an allergic rash just a side effect Keep up with the ibuprofen no aspirin Keep her comfy and hydrated not with sugary drinks and juices which are sugary drinks Water is best if she is not eating try some of the drinks for children that replace electrolytes and have some vitamins If she has no fever is eating and drinking ok dont get too upset Assuming she has been vaccinated against all the nasty bugs I dont know for sure but i have GERD and it causes my heart rate elevate consolt her kids md Same thing happened to my sister turned out she had a cist on her ovarie that burst during sex it is not IBSit is bile refluxu can probably get GERD or gastritis or even peptic ulcer if this condition is prolonged um it was pretty close to a normal one maybe a day or so shorter but since then now i havent had my period since then so idk if its because i have had my period twice in one month or what but i plan on getting a test if i dont get my period within another week  I just had a colonoscopy and was told I had a bleeding ulcer and acid reflux I had absolutely no symptoms for either I had a little swallowing and that was the reason for the test as long as they are not red around the area and not itching you should be safe find new doctor I had the same symptoms with appendicitis See your doctor asap to be evaluated yes wether he is diabetic or not kind of sounds like vge dosent it only takes 30 mins  I would seek a Gastroenterologist I think you might have an upper GI ulcer of some kind If you do not usually get period due to your medications I would honestly advice getting blood work done and an ultrasound from you OBGYN It sounds like you have all the symptoms of early pregnancy I hope this helps Best of luck I dont know how often or how much you eat but from someone who has had similar problems I would suggest cutting back on high fiber foods to like once a day with a meal and take a good probiotic with dinner each night Be sure the probiotic kills more than 1 strain Its over the counter This should relieve your symptoms My stepmother is going through the same thing She also went 4 12 months without a period and then began having 2 periods per month for 3 months She visited her doctor many times who always told her its early menopause Her mother went through menopause at 43 years old Check with your doctor You might want to ask doctor why you are not on carafate liquid to coat and protect your ulcer in addition Percocet is okay you cant take motrin or ibuprofen or NSAIDS with ulcer Percocet has acetaminophentylenol in it but of course you should also get your doctors advice  You probably have hemmoroids I had them and required surgery to have them removed after alternative therapy didnt work creams You need to discuss with your primary physician and he will probably refer you to an general lapro doctor Hope this helps I dont have any problem with my stumic Im sorry that you have to feel sick It says on the label that hydrocodone will cause constipation and u can also have reverse reactions to pain medicine such as if your having trouble sleeping that is the opposite of what the label says about it making u drowsy When I get a bad case of heart burn I can feel pain in my jaw It feels like its in my teeth as well Or maybe its indigestion  chest hurts stomach hurts wonder if its a hart attack Ends up being one of the above not heart attack  You may need a process of elimination Ask your primary care Dr for a referral for a gastroenterologist Have you had a colonoscopy  its NOT as scary as you think If you do get one you should bring someone with you they wont let you drive yourself home If or when they find nothing then go from there I had something similar thats who I went to Calm down a good patient is an educated patient You may be pregnant You shold get a pregnancy test from a store or go see a doctor ASAP get your blood tested may be the iron level is low or B12 painful cramps can be an indicator of miscarriage if you thought you were pregnant what were you doing to get kneed in the stomach that hard im going to guess and say u did lose the baby you should see your doctor so you dont get an infection Pickle juice has salts and electrolytes in it much like gatorade which replaces the electrolytes you lose through sweating preventing cramps My cousin played football in high school in georgia and he says the football team would drink pickle juice during 2 a days in the summer to stay hydrated He swears by it and says itre hydrates faster than water Id say it takes well hour 24 hrs for the virus to die by itself You can use a Lysoltype spray that should help Wash your hands frequently and use sanitizer frequently See your Dr immediately it could just be symptoms of your period Hi not sure what pill ur using but I would talk to your dr because if you are not used to having cramps this bad and now you are it could be a bad reaction to the pills not sure but either way better safe then sorry talk the dr hope u feel better soon  It sounds like you got food poisoning You were probably up all night vomiting and having diarrhea It usually goes away within 2448 hours I have similar symptoms but I also have burping episodes aswell and I was just diagnosed with an hiatial hernia he needs to see a doctor there is something wrong with his blood oxygen levels "}
