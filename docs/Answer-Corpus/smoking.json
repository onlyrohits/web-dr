{"text": "I have been a long term smoker and have tried multiple different methods I am determined not to go into 2013 as a smoker I happended to pick up an electronic cigarette at a store while purchasing other items I also purchased the Nicotine longengers Between these two items I have not smoked in over a week for me a huge improvement I also have not experienced an ill side affects and I dont feel like I am being deprived I really do believe this is helping me as I have never been able to go this long without smoking before Definately worht a try if you have tried everything else I was on Chantix and I did not have all these symptoms but I did get sick to my stomach and had horrible nightmares and bad mood swings I quite on day 8 of taking it and have been clean for two years I learned that drinking milk before I went to bed would make the nightmares go away and it also helped me with the stomach pains through out the day as for the mood swings I warned people to stay away The simple answer to this question is that at this time short of surgically removing the esophagus there is no guaranteed treatment to prevent esophageal cancer in Barretts esophagus But we do have treatments that are helpful and the risk of developing cancer is very low Barretts esophagus occurs when a different cell type replaces the normal cells lining the lower esophagus Usually this is caused by stomach acid backing up into the esophagus gastroesphageal reflux disease GERD Twenty percent or more of adults have chronic GERD and of these 10 to 15 will have Barretts esophagus If you have GERD its important to know if you also have Barretts esophagus Thats because Barretts esophagus can later turn into precancer or cancer of the esophagus Adults with chronic severe reflux have over a 50 chance of having Barretts esophagus The good news however is that recent studies show that the risk of developing cancer from Barretts is low Every year only 012  of the patients with Barretts or about one in 860 people develop esophageal cancer Barretts is diagnosed by an upper endoscopy During an upper endoscopy a doctor puts a tube into your mouth and down into your esophagus and takes samples An endoscopy is recommended for patients with Barretts and no dysplasia every 3 to 5 years The majority of patients with Barretts have no evidence of dysplasia This means that although the cells lining the esophagus have changed to a different cell type they are still healthy A small proportion of people will have dysplasia or cancer For the majority of patients with Barretts and no evidence of dysplasia the recommended treatment is the use of proton pump inhibitors PPIs Some examples of these drugs are available over the counter omeprazole Prilosec lansoprazole Prevacid and pantoprazole Protonix but the doses recommended for Barretts are prescription strength and often given twice daily Treatment does not usually cure Barretts but it keeps it from getting worse PPIs have not been proven to prevent esophageal cancer in Barretts Other treatments for Barretts include general recommendations for GERD such as Avoid alcohol fatty foods caffeine drinks and other foods or beverages that can make GERD worse Dont eat a large meal before bed Raise the head of the bed when you sleep There are other treatments such as radiofrequency ablation of the esophagus or antireflux surgery that have been used in some patients with Barretts and no dysplasia but this is not generally recommended Some studies have suggested that aspirin and other similar drugs like ibuprofen Advil might reduce the risk of esophageal cancer but this is not currently recommended If you have Barretts talk to your doctor about your symptoms and concerns Your doctor will be able to help you weigh your risk of developing dysplasia or cancer and help you design the best strategy for your care I dont even know what kind of stampede therell be to answer this one but first comes to mind is the increased risk of ca er cancer and using nicotine also a ca risk at the same time would compound your vulnerability  Being healthy with good circulation diet energy etc do play a role Could be side effect of drugs or medications youre on if youre taking any Could be something more complicated too which you have to go to urologist They are pretty cool and get questions like that all the time Vitamin E might help It has been said to work Otherwise urologist have meds that help Im sure youve seen the commercials A nusance but not a daunting problem Could be your mood too I have had phases of superhyped to nothinhappenin back and forth throughout the years Sometimes its the chick Wait it out Try a health kick Maybe vitamin E If it doesnt go away then see someone but dont freak out I wish that I had better news for you It is a certainty that you did everything you could to help your son before he passed away And now you are facing the same scary situation again Unfortunately sometimes despite our most valiant efforts to help a sick family member they seem to be on a selfdestruct mission and will implode At 21 years old your grandson is all grownup and considered a man You cannot force him to change his reckless lifestyle or to seek professional help To be honest he seems to heading for either death or prison Here are my recommendations to help with the challenges that he presents to you Do not enable his behavior by giving him money or by helping him to circumvent his personal responsibilities Keep yourself physically and emotionally safe If you feel that danger is in the air by way of your grandson then detach yourself from his life That may mean having him legally removed from your home having locks changed on your residence calling the police for help or by obtaining a restraining order Sometimes mentally sick individuals along with their friends are capable of causing their well meaning family members physical emotional and legal harm Do not blame yourself for his negative lifestyle It is not your fault Your grandson will exploit any guilt that you may display He is most likely morally bankrupt and will rob you of your physical property and health as well as your love for him I wish you well during this time of uncertainty  Non airborne asbestos means that all of the asbestos material remains undisturbed with its particles remaining intact Airborne asbestos represents just the opposite with particles disbursed throughout the air and now having the potential to be inhaled into the lungs As you may know asbestos is a natural occurring mineral that is highly toxic when inhaled into the lungs Years ago asbestos was used as a construction product for soundproofing insulation and fireproofing Its use has been banned in most countries since the 1970s1980 but remains in many previously constructed buildings Asbestos related disorders may be in a dormant state and take from 10 years to 50 years before materializing into symptoms The two 2 approved methods for asbestos remediation are Complete removal This type of removal may cost as much as 2000040000 per hour by licensed professional contractors The technicians must dress in full protective gear including respirators Disposal must be completed as hazardous material to the accepting facility for final disposition Encapsulation of all undisturbed asbestos Coating of the material with ordinary paint may actually cause more problems than it solves Scrapping and brushing of the asbestos can cause the fibers to dislodge and become airborne Special paints are available to permanently seal the asbestos Of course and type of remodeling or demolition projects can again cause the asbestos to become airborne In summary and my opinions I am not an expert in the radiation process for asbestos But I believe that asbestos could be in part a contributing factor influencing the development of your sisters COPD Smoking absolutely Smoking hastens the period of time for symptoms to become obvious Your sister needs to findout who did the coating of the asbestos and with what material Wetting of the asbestos causes it to break down into a chewylike substance with the possibly of it become airborne a very real possibility Your sister should find out if air samples of her apartment were made before and after the remediation process I would recommend that she inspect all of these reports She may also wish to conduct her own air quality testing Kits are sold at modest prices and sent to independent labs to be analyzed for a fee of about 2500 per kit Several kits placed throughout the apartment are recommended Asbestos remediation should always be completed by professionals It is too important of a health concern not to require complete disclosure by the property manager of all asbestos actions An evaluation of the completed remediation actions should be conducted by your sisters own independent company The short answer is yes Each asthma patient responds differently to firsthand smoke and secondhand smoke Much depends on the severity of the individuals asthma disease progression other breathing compromises such as COPD the overall health of the patient the age of the asthma patient and the degree of smoking being done in the home that is being visited An attack of breathing difficulty can occur even hours after leaving the offending house Some recent studies have begun to evaluate the danger of thirdhand smoke  This is another form of environmental smoke It is the residue of tobacco smoking that is found on the clothing or hair and skin of a smoker and on the furniture or in the car where people have been using tobacco products Studies have also shown that the smoke residue from 2nd and 3rd hand smoke is even more dangerous than that of 1st hand smoke This is because more toxic chemicals are received by the victim of environmental smoke then are received by the smoker themselves Asthma patients sensitive to a smokers poor home air quality should consider that location Out Of Bounds For Visitation Explain to the smoker that you have asthma and cannot visit their home due to your lung disease Also explain to them the definition of thirdhandsmoke Sure some folks will balk and claim that thirdhandsmoke does not exist But responsible family members and true friends will understand your lung heath needs and concerns I am sorry but there isnt any way around my answering this question without injecting some medical terms into the discussion The sense of smell is referred to in medical terminology as the Olfactory system What you are describing in your question is called Olfactory Hallucinations In the medical community the technical name for Olfactory Hallucinations is called Phantosmia probably derived from phantom Phantosmia can present itself in a very real manner Suffers smell an odor like smoke or some other odor and may even experience a gaging sensation In actually there is really no smoke or environmental cause supporting that reaction Phantosmia can be caused by some serious medical conditions that require discussion and investigation with a doctor These may include brain damage caused by tumors or trauma epilepsy and infectious damage to the olfactory system I am sorry but there isnt any way around my answering this question without injecting some medical terms into the discussion The sense of smell is referred to in medical terminology as the Olfactory system What you are describing in your question is called Olfactory Hallucinations In the medical community the technical name for Olfactory Hallucinations is called Phantosmia probably derived from phantom Phantosmia can present itself in a very real manner Suffers smell an odor like smoke or some other odor

discussion and investigation with a doctor These may include brain damage caused by tumors or trauma epilepsy and infectious damage to the olfactory system  Second hand smoke is tobacco smoke exhaled by a smoker and involuntarily breathed in by another person Here are some 2nd hand smoke facts according to the National Cancer Society At least 69 chemicals produced by 2nd hand smoke are known to cause cancer 2nd hand smoke does cause cancer in nonsmokers 2nd hand smoke has also been associated with heart disease in adults and ear infections asthma sudden death syndrome in children 2nd hand smoke has no safe exposure level I am not an expert on building structures or their air circulation systems and do not have technical details of your buildings air circulation system With that said Ill provide my understanding of the air quality in many office buildings occupied today and referred to as sick buildings These buildings may have poor air exchange systems filtering systems that are inadequate in size not adequately cleaned or otherwise properly maintained My own anecdotal accounting is that many of these types of building almost never receive fresh air as windows are only for the aesthetic purpose of providing natural light The windows are sometimes permanently fixed shut In effect the building occupants may be continually breathing the same polluted air Irritations of the eyes ears and throats are frequent complaints of these building occupants due in part to chemical and environmental containments from indoor and outdoor sources In summary 2nd hand smoke is dangerous It can cause cancer and other chronic health problems Many office buildings today circulate unhealthy air  My conclusion is that your health problems at least in part may be due to the effects of 2nd hand smoke being breathed in while working in your office building Yes it could cause the baby harm According to NBCs nightly News and numerous other sources a clinical study has revealed that smoke on indoor surfaces like carpets upholstery and even clothing can mix with the air to create a cancer concern A chemical reaction can occur when the 3rd hand residue of cigarette smoke interacts with nitrous acid to form a carcinogenic substance This type of pollution is particularly threatening to infants and toddlers The other grandmother needs to be made aware of the danger posed to her innocent grandchild through this underappreciated type of toxic exposure Someone perhaps the grandmothers son or daughter can gently and seriously present the reality of her holding a child while ridden with smoke infected clothing and hair she almost certainly is unaware of the inherent harm being created   on your stoke recovery and smoking cessation I smoked 2 12 packs of cigarettes per day and made a conscious decision to stop before overt signs of lung or heart disease surfaced I read that a person who stops smoking at the age of 50 adds six years to their life expectancy People who quit smoking after having a heart attack reduce their chances of having another heart attack by 50 But with a history of smoking for 40 years lung and heart disease can still materialize even after years of abstinence For example I stopped smoking almost 30 years ago and thought that I was out of woods only to have been recently diagnosed with COPD Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and a rightsided heart block The great news is that you will have decreased by 50 after 10 years of nonsmoking your chances of succumbing to cancer of the mouth throat esophagus bladder cervix and pancreas Yes it is possible that you have emphysema Please make an appointment to be evaluated by your personal physician Chances are that he or she will request chest xrays blood work an EKG and other studies They may also refer you to a cardiologist pulmonologist gastroenterologist and other medical specialist for consultation Youve come so far and deserve an opportunity to lead a productive life After all youre only 50 years old and should have many good years in the future Please do not dismiss the shortness of breath and changes in the anatomical look of your stomach accompanied with distress  I do not believe that you have a mental condition THC the active ingredient of marijuana has a metabolic 12 life of approximately 20 hours Some of the THC is stored in fat tissue and eventually released into the blood stream with elimination through the kidneys and processed as urine It can take the average person 2030 days or even longer to metabolize all of the THC The psychological and physiological effects of one marijuana joint may last 8 hours or longer Reflexes may remain impaired for 5 hours or longer even when the THC concentration is lowered Having flashback symptoms as you describe lasting 40 minutes may be unusual for you but may be typical for other people Much of stoned flashback episodes are individualized according to the person THC concentration exposure the frequency of usage body type whether you regularly or only infrequently smoke marijuana tolerance builds up to regular THC exposure and the overall health condition of the person Some individuals never experience flashbacks You may be experiencing the lingering effects of THC and are not mentally ill As you know your mind and body are in a state of arousal while under the influence of THC causing motor coordination emotional and behavioral changes Please be careful and do not over use this drug  It is a positive preventive measure to regularly check your blood pressure You may follow the doctors advice on when and how often to measure the readings I suspect that 2xs per day should be sufficient over a 47 day period to see a pattern of BP measurements I always record the following data details in addition to the BP readings date time arm used sitting standing recent engagement in activities that I was involved with such as eating and exercise also smoking if applicable as well as emotional factors such as stressful situations It is then recommended to show your journal readings to your doctor for their assessment If you are using your own BP machine it is not a bad idea to also take the machine with you to your doctors appointment and have its accuracy verified  I also read about this study and will expand on the details listed in your question It is an interesting study that ultimately must be verified and judged by the scientific experts Although nutrition and medical experts say that its too soon to draw cause and effect conclusions some of the points reported in the study cause me genuine health concerns Here some factors considered in conducting the study The findings emerged from a study of 6381 people aged 50 and over who took part in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey which tracks a representative group of adults and children in the US People who took part in the study consumed an average of 1823 calories a day with 51 coming from carbohydrates 33 from fat and 16 from protein of which two thirds was animal protein Here are some of the points developed by the study High levels of dietary animal protein in people under 65 years of age was linked to a four times increase in their risk of death from cancer or diabetes and almost double the risk of dying from any cause over an 18year period researchers found The overall harmful effects seen in the study were almost completely wiped out when the protein came from plant sources such as beans and legumes though cancer risk was still three times as high in middleaged people who ate a proteinrich diet compared with those on a lowprotein diet My impressions and conclusions are Its one study and more research needs to occur The validity of the study must be confirmable through the official publication of its results to the scientific community for peer review The study must be able to be replicated One group of people the senior citizens actually seemed to benefit from a diet rich in proteins In the over 65 age population  a highprotein diet cut the risk of death from any cause by 28 and reduced cancer deaths by 60 according to the published study The one point made in the study that I cannot endorse is in comparing the effects of smoking with the effect of a high protein diet Maybe its me but I question which step in the Scientific Method was employed to draw such a conclusion Personally Im not waiting for more evidence to convince me that the studys conclusions are at least plausible and most likely accurate I see enough of a correlation in this study for folks under the age of 65 between consuming a protein rich diet and cancer to adjust my eating habits Smoking and pulmonary exertion can definitely effect Asthma If you have been told you may have it in the past my advice would be this 1 Put down the cigs and avoid smoke strong smells and fast temp changes ie stepping out of a warm car into cold air 2Start deep breathing exercises My doctor had me start with just ten a day He said to find a quiet relaxing place where I can time my breaths Breath in slowly and deeply until it is uncomfortable and hold it until you cant Do this ten times timing each trying to hold it the same amount with each breath Each night try holding it a little longer You will be amazed how well this will help 3 Check with a doctor Your lungs are just one of the things that may be causing shortness of breath You may need an inhaler to help open your pulmonary tubes 4 Ask ten smokers over 40 when they started and why Also ask if they had it to do over again would they do the same Both my kids tried smoking in college After doing the math on how much the habit will cost in a life time and talking to experienced smokers they both decided to stop before it became additive and believe me no matter how little you use cigs they will become additive Good Luck and use your head Fever isnt necessarily a bad thing its a sign that shes fighting an infection A temperature of 105 F is high in anyone And a fever will only contribute to her misery and put her at risk for dehydration The first step is to make sure she gets plently of fluid Ibuprofen acetamenophen or aspirin can help improve how she feels Check the labels on the medications shes getting since you want to avoid excess dosing Many cold and flu remedies contain many of the same ingedients as these pain relievers If these simple steps dont help Id suggest taking her to the local urgent care center yes In my opinion it may be because cocaine screws up the membranes in your nostrils Sorta like if you burn your tongue on soup or whatever your sense of taste is temporarily just not there no Instead of eating those greasy foods you should really just try do do regular small bowl of lettuce or a carrot or any kind of veggie or even a fruit I am not a bright one but I try to eat healthy When you have high blood pressure or diabetes I heard that eating fruit or a veggie will help You get healthier or better I am not a expert I am a regular person so ask you friend family neighborsbut eat healthy and you can may be get better So stay strong and go on It usually takes about a month regaurdless if this is your first time or your tenth Best solution dont smoke weed simple as that  My understanding is that the nicotine is out of your system within 24 hours Just one more source of info for you One of the first steps in quitting smoking is to examine the different methods to become smoke free and decide which one would work best for you Some of the options include nicotine replacement therapy NRT such as gum or patches prescription medication like Chantix or Wellbutrin or methods like tapering postponing or cold turkey Do research beforehand to weigh the pros and cons of each method before implementing a program Next think about how ready you are to quit smoking on a scale from 1 to 10 with 1 being not ready to quit whatsoever and 10 being ready to quit right now Pick a number that best represents where you stand at the moment Why didnt you pick a number that was lower Here it may help to think about the benefits that you stand to gain from quitting smoking or your reasons behind wanting to quit What would it take for you to be higher on that scale towards a 10 then At this point it might help to think about what you would need to become fully motivated and put your thoughts about quitting smoking into action Its important to develop strategies to help you be successful What are potential barriers that may get in the way of your success and how do you plan to overcome them It might be helpful to tell your friends your desire to quit and enlist their support in working towards your goal No matter what dont give up Many people have several unsuccessful attempts before they finally are able to become smoke free because quitting smoking can be an incredibly difficult thing to do for some people The WebMD smoking cessation center would be a great resource for more information and for direction on where to get more help regarding becoming smoke free Talk to your doctor for further guidance as well Nicotine levels in your body will drop significantly between 8 to 12 hours after your last cigarette Your body wont be completely nicotinefree until 24 to 72 hours afterwards however Do an internet search for smoking cessation timeline if youre curious about some of the other benefits that youll notice by becoming smoke free For example after 24 hours your risk of having a heart attack decreases dramatically and your ability to smell and taste will be enhanced after 48 hours After years of having quit smoking your risk of developing cancer having a heart attack or having a stroke decrease significantly Quitting smoking is one of the most important things that you can do for your health Keep up the great work There are many great resources available if you are looking to quit smoking Heres just a few of them  WebMDs smoking cessation health center  lots of good information tools and resources to help you quit smoking httpwwwwebmdcomsmokingcessationdefaulthtm  A list of other websites organizations and quitlines available to help with smoking cessation as well httpwwwwebmdcomsmokingcessationquittingtobaccouseotherplacestogethelp  WebMDs smoking cessation community  speak with other people going through the same process httpexchangeswebmdcomsmokingcessationexchange  Try browsing WebMD Answers for similar questions that have already been answered by other experts searching for words like cigarette or smoking cessation  Ask a human resource person if your place of employment or insurance company offers any tobacco cessation benefits Of course its always recommended to speak with your doctor for more insight or information too No I would suggest you tell them to check your levels Often times they will record the thc levels on a failed test They should be able to determine by your levels that you have not smoked again Im a cannabis patient and have used bactirm ds before you will be fine It is HIGHLY unlikely your psychosis was caused by marijuana I find that many physicians are quick to blame marijuana for any psychological problems they cannot explain not realizing that most times the patient is using marijuana to selfmedicate their already existing symptoms I would first seek a second opinion Also pay attention to the details did your psychosis go away as soon as you stopped pot Did it start shortly after starting pot Did you have any signs or symptoms before you ever used pot Did pot make it worse or better If it correlates with the psychosis I would recommend not using it again its not for everyone However if you have any question I would seek a second opinion It sounds like you are having symptoms of GERD or acid reflux disease With your age and history and the length of your symptoms it is HIGHLY unlikely you are having a heart attack If you have a history of anxiety and heartburn it could very well turn into GERD I have acid reflux and the symptoms your describing coincide with GERD I find taking an extra strength Zantac 150 mg once every morning keeps me from experiencing any symptoms If that doesnt help or doesnt help ENOUGH you can always speak to your doctor There are proton inhibitors they can prescribe you that will work much better Proton inhibitors slow the production of stomach acid However if you are having any other symptoms or your current ones get worse I would definitely contact your doctor right away I smoked for almost forty years I have diabetes high blood pressure and high cholesterol I started using an e cigarette 3 years ago My blood pressure has improved My cholesterol has improved and my diabetes has improved I have more energy I completely stopped smoking I can breathe again and I dont get winded easily All the controversy about e cigarettes is crazy Anyone who has been a smoker and uses an e cigarette will see all the benefits compared to smoking No one knows of long term effects but it has to be better than smoking I know because of how I feel now that I dont smoke anymore If the FDA wants to study e cigarettes they should do it with all the e cigarette smokers Im not a doctor but I know that I feel ten times better using an e cigarette Im sorry to hear youre going through this Anxiety is no fun no matter what causes it I suggest you investigate CBT This type of therapy is issuebased and is designed to help resolve issues like yours quite quickly  often in four to five sessions If that sounds impossible take it from me It can happen In a nutshell cognitive behavioral therapy helps you recognize the early symptoms of in your case an anxiety episode coming on so that you can disrupt your bodys physical response to the trigger You already know your trigger heights Since you cant avoid the trigger CBT will teach you how to change your thought patterns and behaviors to derail the panic attack before it can get started It sounds easy and it actually can be easy  with some practice You can find many therapists who specialize in CBT I urge you to find one and get started soon because theres no reason for you to continue limiting your life and experiencing the nasty symptoms of a panic attack for even one more day Wishing you well I applaud your decision and fortitude in quitting smoking when you got pregnant Its not easy to quit and you should pat yourself on the back While I sympathize with and support your sentiments the truth is no one person can ethically coerce another person to do their bidding It probably will be harmful to the baby to be raised in an environment filled with cigarette smoke Studies confirm a link between infant exposure to secondhand smoke and asthma rates Nonetheless you cannot force your husband to quit smoking Each person has to come to that decision on his or her own Can you compromise and convince your husband to smoke outdoors only This would benefit his child and at the same time allow him to live the lifestyle he chooses It also might make it easier for you to maintain your personal smokefree lifestyle I wish I had more to offer but your husband is going to do what hes going to do You have to do what you need to do And Im glad you chose to quit smoking Wow So many issues here Where to begin I think there may be some miscommunication going on Sepsis is a lifethreatening condition that normally leads to immediate hospitalization People can die very quickly from  so I think its unlikely your friend is home lounging around smoking weed after being diagnosed with this illness Next theres the obvious issue that no 17 year old should be taking illicit drugs Not only is it illegal but the brain is not fully developed at age 17 No 17 year old is truly able to make informed decisions about using such drugs In fact your question about whether or not your friends use of these drugs is essentially bad for him illustrates that neither of you know the first thing about how these agents work or what effects they have on your body No one should take any drug including prescriptions without knowing the answers to these questions Lastly smoking is bad for you If everyone on the face of the earth doesnt know that by now woe betide them Its one of the worst things you can do for your health can lead to many types of cancer and may shorten your lifespan I wish your friend all the best He needs to stop all of these bad habits to overcome whatever illness he has and to go on to lead a long healthy life Longterm smoking generally does increase the likelihood of developing  If the coughing and spitting up mucus while smoking are new symptoms it could be a signal that lung damage is occurring including the development of COPD Id suggest your husband see a doctor about this The coughing and spitting may or may not be related to the smoking He will only find out by having a physical exam Keep in mind smoking damages more organs than just the lungs Smoking can have a negative impact on the heart urinary bladder colon mouth throat and many other parts of the body Quitting smoking is always the best option but I realize it can very difficult for some people to do And some people simply dont want to quit smoking I hope your husband goes for a physical exam to find out how his lungs and heart are doing I wish you all the best Well first Im obligated to note that marijuana smoking is illegal under US federal law even in states that regulate the use of medical marijuana But as to your question There shouldnt be any conflict between cannabis use and Vicodin hydrocodone Cannabis is not an opioid the way hydrocodone is Both substances provide mild pain relief so if anything cannabis might make you feel as if the pain relieving effect of the hydrocodone is enhanced That said its generally not a good idea to mix drugs with similar properties such as pain relievers So your best bet is to avoid smoking marijuana while taking hydrocodone The hydrocodone should provide sufficient pain relief on its own If it doesnt please contact your health care provider for a different pain reliever There are plenty to choose from Hope this helps Well this is an interesting question Im not sure theres a straightforward answer because Im not sure anyone has studied this Heres what we know Smoking around infants and children can cause them to inhale secondhand smoke which may be linked to higher rates of certain lung problems like asthma We also know secondhand smoke contains harmful chemicals and that this smoke containing chemicals can settle on surfaces such as clothing draperies countertops and so on Will coming in contact with this potentially toxic material on someones shirt or fingertips cause problems for your baby My guess and its strictly a guess is probably not If this were the case the entire Baby Boomer generation would probably exhibit symptoms because nearly all of our relatives smoked and held babies at the same time You can reduce any possible risk by gently wiping off your baby with a damp cloth after he or she has been cuddled by someone you believe has tobacco smoke residue on their clothing or hands You probably dont need to be overly aggressive about this Dont scrub the little ones skin off But a simple swipe should do the trick Hope this helps I think youll probably be in the clear For most occasional smokers nicotine is cleared from the system within 34 days For people who smoke regularly or who are exposed regularly to secondhand smoke nicotine can be detected in urine for up to about 25 days after the last exposure If youre smoking one cigar a month I wouldnt consider you to be in the regular smoker category That is unless you make that cigar last for days or weeks in a row But assuming youre having one nice evening a month with a cigar you should probably pass your urine test I know I should be discouraging you from smoking in any way shape or form but I find it pretty hard to chastise someone who simply wants to enjoy a cigar once in awhile So let me just say that all inhalation of tobacco smoke even if you just pull it into your mouth has the potential to cause cancer Be sure to receive regular oral exams to make sure youre not developing any suspicious lesions from your habit Take care Good for you for quitting smoking That is a true achievement to be proud of In terms of the persistent cough one year later That is a good question and I would advise you to take it up with your primary care provider physician nurse practitioner or physician assistant Several possible explanations for the coughing come to mind First depending on how long you smoked you may have permanently damaged your lungs which results in their inability to clear mucus Although youre not coughing up any phlegm it could still be residing down there in your lungs and triggering a coughing response Second smoking damages more than just the lungs Again depending on how long and how much you smoked you may have damaged your heart muscle If the heart cannot contract with enough force to move blood through the lungs properly it causes to occur This congestion can cause a dry hacking cough  especially when youre lying down I think you definitely should see your health care provider for an exam The cause of the cough may be highly treatable if caught in time Best wishes to you To answer your first question No A urine test that checks for bacteria will not look for other substances in the urine To your second question If you inhale a small amount of secondhand marijuana smoke might it show up on a drug screen test Id guess its doubtful but not impossible It definitely wont show up on a urine culture designed to check for bacteria I hope that helps This is a great question and one you should ask your health care provider Its a bit too involved to go into here but Ill briefly outline some not all of the options And luckily WebMD offers this handy  A water pill or diuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide or furosemide lowers blood pressure by getting rid of excess water in your system This essentially lowers your overall blood volume If you have or ringing in the ears you should talk to your health care provider about using a potassiumsparing water pill because the other type can make tinnitus worse ACE angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors have become a popular choice These medications basically cause your blood vessels to relax which lowers your blood pressure These medications usually have few side effects Beta blockers work by slowing down the pace of your heartbeat and also reducing the force at which the heart contracts This combination causes your blood pressure to come down If your doctor suggests a beta blocker be sure to get specific dosing instructions Some beta blockers shouldnt be taken when your pulse rate is low Again you ask a good question for your doctor If you go on a blood pressure medication be sure to know what it does specifically why its a good choice for you and what possible side effects you should watch out for Hope this helps I wish I could give you a good answer but I dont think researchers have studied smoking at quite that micro a level In healthcare we measure smoking by the packyear We calculate this number based on the average number of packs smoked per day times the number of years the person has smoked For example a person who smokes one pack per day for 20 years has a 20 packyear history A person like yourself who smokes on average 20 cigarettes per week which calculates to roughly 015 pack per day for 20 years would have a roughly 3 packyear history  the same as a person who smoked one pack per day for three years Regardless of the manner in which you smoke a lot at one time or a few spread out over a longer period youre probably doing about the same amount of damage to your lungs and other vital structures Intuitively I would think the damage would be worse from smoking many cigarettes all at once as opposed to smoking the same number spread out over a greater length of time Rapidly introducing a volume of carcinogens and toxins probably is worse than trickling them in You sound wellinformed about the risks of smoking so Ill leave you with one little tidbit Did you know one of the morecommon cancers related to smoking is bladder cancer especially in men So the next time you light up ask yourself if you can envision the day when youll be emptying your urine through a pouch strapped to your thigh If not then you might want to rethink the whole smoking thing Wishing you well I wish I could give you a good answer but I dont think researchers have studied smoking at quite that micro a level In healthcare we measure smoking by the packyear We calculate this number based on the average number of packs smoked per day times the number of years the person has smoked For example a person who smokes one pack per day for 20 years has a 20 packyear history A person like yourself who smokes on average 20 cigarettes

damage would be worse from smoking many cigarettes all at once as opposed to smoking the same number spread out over a greater length of time Rapidly introducing a volume of carcinogens and toxins probably is worse than trickling them in You sound wellinformed about the risks of smoking so Ill leave you with one little tidbit Did you know one of the morecommon cancers related to smoking is bladder cancer especially in men So the next time you light up ask yourself if you can envision the day when youll be emptying your urine through a pouch strapped to your thigh If not then you might want to rethink the whole smoking thing Wishing you well Sorry youre going through this While youre obviously young to have heart trouble thats always the first thing that comes to mind when someone complains of chest pain In fact if your chest pain begins to feel like a crushing or squeezing type discomfort that wont go away you definitely should go to the emergency room However I think the more likely culprit here is a condition called  This is an inflammation of the cartilage between the rib and the sternum breastbone near the top of the sternum Its quite common in young women Several things can cause it but its not usually serious You probably should have this checked out by a medical professional just to be on the safe side But unless youre having other  I wouldnt run off to the

heat the drug and inhale the toxic fumes These fumes affect the dopamine in brain which is released when the body experiences pleasure Crystal Meth triggers that reaction which in turn produces more dopamine Over a long period of time the brain may suffer trauma from increased drug abuse which could lead to memory loss and emotional instability Studies by the International Journal of Drug Policy have indicated that individuals who used Crystal Meth in large amounts even for very brief amounts of time experienced panic attacks paranoia violent behavior as well as irregular heart rate and chest pains Many individuals who abuse or are addicted to Crystal Meth often times result to illicit behavior in order to support their drug habit  which is not the best environment for children to be part

pharmacist if you decide to change your multivitamin or add other supplements to your routine Smoking is not recommended under any circumstances but it does not interfere with these medications Based on my own experience having smoked for over 25 years nonstop what finally worked for me was to do it in 3 steps over a period of 34 weeks Go down to 10 a day for a few days but no more that a week then 5 and then stay on 1 a day for 12 weeks making sure the 1 a day is smoked at different times of the day avoiding as much as possible favorite times such as after a meal or with coffee or a drink by the time the last week is over withdrawal effects after complete stoppage will be negligible if absolutely necessary you may extend the one a day or reduce to 23 a week for another week or 2 but the key is to never go back up to higher levels After completely off the habit it is not catastrophic to smoke ONE cigarette if you feel a real urge to do so as long as you NEVER exceed your min exit dose If that ever happens it becomes crucial to go 100 smoke free at which point the addiction is 95 gone One thing to examine is the chemical attraction Is this still at pretty much the same levels as when this relationship started or has it deteriorated too New post marriage annoying personality physical andor behavioral discoveries could impact chemical attraction and lead to difficiencies in otherwise perfectly normal individuals You may want to in addition to testing your T levels reassess that side of the relationship Blockages in coronary arteries are caused by inflammation which

lot of bacteria in your mouth Some people due to cultural social or bacterial reasons will have different types of bacteria in their mouth as you ones that youve never encountered before So when you kiss you probably french kiss and when you do you exchange those germs in turn effect your throat and give you a bacterial infection Cavities plaque on your teeth are all caused by bacteria eating and growing on the food particles left in your mouth after you eat POSSIBLE SOLUTION You can try using mouthwash afterwards and try to kill the bacteria that enter your own mouth or if your close enough to your partner both use mouth wash before making out If you live with them you can try to convince them the increase their oral hygiene In theory youll eventually build up an immunity to his standard regime of germs in his mouth Youre probably as sensitive as I am this used to happen to me all the time with a previous partner but since Ive become older I dont have the problembut my current partner is better at oral hygiene Also you can talk to your doctor about things that you can do to prevent this Obviously no longer kissing is going to be a solution but I doubt that will happen If it becomes a serious issue and it doesnt go away within 3 days go to a doctor and tell them the possible origin As some one else pointed out there are also STIs that can cause oral infections ones that are transferred from genitals tofrom your mouththroat If youre getting seriously sick you need to consider that possibility that they need to be checked out He may be a carrier or host But that needs to be discussed with a doctor as well You were diagnosed with psychosis from merijuana Then if you smoke youll suffer from psychosis again Did you do research as to what psychosis is how it evolves and how bad it can get You need to look at your family and see if they have any mental illnesses But honestly look up psychosis and do your research A sever case can be a horrible way to live If you cant stop smoking due to a mental illnes and you want to take the risk you should go into addiction counseling first Also look into pschizophrenia and merijuanna use in young adults You wont find very much information in regards to developmental issues and the use of drugs The theory is that the brain develops as you get older and if you introduce a chemical constantly to the brain the brain wont develop as well or as it could because it designed and developed itself under the use of something that shouldnt be there It changes how it functions Its why antidepressents are bad for children From my understanding Good luck and dont end up in a psych ward Those places arnt fun A metaphore Developing mental illness is like falling asleep You can never tell where it happened and the only way you knew you were asleep is when you wake up Some people never wake up or are unable to Often laryngitis that is caused by a cold or flu virus will resolve within 2 weeks Its great that you quit smoking There are other several conditions that can cause laryngitis or hoarseness Vocal cord nodules vocal cord polyps acid reflux irritation from smoking or overuse of the vocal cords from yelling are some common causes One serious cause of persistent hoarseness is cancer You can ask your doctor about referring you to an otolayrngologist to get an examination of your vocal cords if your symptoms persist  Im pretty sure they recommend you wait at least 24 hours although it would be optimum to quit  sometimes that is a little harder said than done I was lucky to make it one hour when I smoked lol

Here are some ideas Exercise on a regular basis  30 minutes of cardiovascular exercise on most days Replace saturated fats animal fatsbaked goodsfried foods etc with plant sources of fat including vegetable oils olive oil and canola avocado nuts and seeds and nut butters Drink alcohol in moderation if you dont drink now there is no need to start Eat a diet that is low in refined carbohydrates white bread sugar candy etc but high in fruits vegetables whole grains lean protein and healthy fats Include soy in your diet For more details on increasing HDL cholesterol see this WebMD article Good luck First off congratulations on your weight loss I think you have a couple of choices right now You can focus on maintaining your weight with healthy habits instead of losing as you deal with your back issues and surgery In order to lose weight you will need to lower the calories you take in to make up for the lack of activity Its best to do this with professional help such as a registered dietitian or through a medically supervised program I dont know how much weight you have to lose the calories youve been taking in or the state of your health which are all factors to take under consideration I think the first choice makes the most sense because lowering your calories without exercise can slow down your metabolism You can also see a physical therapist to get ideas for exercises you can do I encourage you not to go back to old eating habits and use this as an opportunity to live a healthy lifestyle without focusing on weight You may be tempted to eat because of your situation but if you can maintain your weight and learn how to deal with stress in a healthy way that is true success And just because you are not losing weight now doesnt mean you wont be able to in the future Good luck Quitting smoking makes a difference right away in the way you feel You can taste and smell food better Your breath smells better Your cough goes away These benefits happen for men and women of all ages even those who are older They happen for healthy people as well as those who already have a disease or condition caused by smoking Even more importantly in the long run quitting smoking cuts the risk of lung cancer many other cancers heart disease stroke and other lung or respiratory diseases such as bronchitis pneumonia and emphysema Moreover exsmokers have better health than current smokers For example exsmokers have fewer days of illness fewer health complaints and less bronchitis and pneumonia than current smokers Finally quitting smoking saves money A packaday smoker who pays 400 per pack can expect to save more than 1408 per year Whats more it appears that the price of cigarettes will continue to rise in coming years as will the financial rewards of quitting After a tooth has been removed a blood clot forms in the area This protects the bone and nerves and helps the area to heal If the blood clot becomes dislodged a very painful condition called a dry socket can occur This is more likely to occur if you smoke suck on a straw or other device or take certain medications If your mouth has been feeling better every day and then suddenly starts to become worse you need to see your dentist right away Here is the link to a WebMD article that goes into more detail about dry sockets  As a doctor I am much more concerned about your drinking and smoking habits I urge you to talk with your healthcare provider and get on a more healthy path You are not alone One out of every 10 people in the US gets heartburn at least once a week One of the most common causes of heartburn is acid reflux This happens when stomach acid washes back up into the esophagus or food tube It is good that you dont smoke or drink These are major triggers for heartburn in many people Acidic foods and coffee can also cause heartburn Some other things that may help prevent heartburn include \tElevate the head of your bed with 6 or 8 inch blocks or use a wedge under the mattress \tWear clothing that is loose around your waist \tDont lie down after eating \tAvoid foods that cause you symptoms Some people get heartburn with fatty foods chocolate peppermint or soda \tLose weight if you are overweight \tEat smaller meals If you have been having heartburn more than once or twice a week or if has been going on for more than a couple of weeks you may have a more serious condition called acid reflux disease or GERD gastroesophageal reflux disease Symptoms of heart disease can also feel like heartburn Make an appointment with your doctor He or she can find out what is causing your symptoms and help you get relief For more information check out the WebMD HeartburnGERD Health Center It sounds like you have canker sores also called aphthous ulcers They are quite common and can typically be easily treated by your primary care doctor They will typically go away on their own To help with the pain and healing your doctor may prescribe a mouth rinse Certain medical problems can also make canker sores more likely Conditions often associated with canker sores are autoimmune conditions such as MS and even hypothyroidism  conditions where the immune system mistakenly attacks parts of your own body So if you tend to get these frequently you should let your doctor know so you can be better prepared to treat them when they happen Ive

tells it like it is Youve likely read how smoking can cause lung cancer and heart disease Now its time to read about what smoking does to your feet Sometimes a doctor can tell just by looking at patients feet whether they smoke says James Mahoney DPM an associate professor of podiatric surgery at Des Moines University in Iowa The skin on their feet is often thinner shinier and reddish in colour he says Your feet are located a long way from your heart which means that even under the best of circumstances they dont receive as much blood circulation as other parts of your body And if you smoke your body is definitely not working under peak conditions A condition called peripheral arterial disease  which affects about 8 million Americans  is one way that smoking can seriously harm your feet Did say tells it like it is Good Luck Hi Your not that far over the top there are lots of ways of bringing it down even before you think of statins these you dont really want to take more later

There are chemicals in marijuana that initiate the production of immune system cells called myeloidderived suppressor cells Immune system cells are usually protective but these cells will suppress the immune system yes i can tell you from personal experience that it can and does just keep staying away from the stuff theres a lot of people who dont feel like that and they will pressure you and pressure you to keep smoking it but you have to just not smoke it its still gonna be in your system for awhile if you just dont smoke it in time the symptoms will get milder and milder and will eventually dissipate just do not smoke that sh anymore and you will be fine trust me If your son has a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia he is trying to fight very powerful demons It is one of the most difficult psychiatric disorders there is and as you say it comes with other problems including severe anxiety Many individuals with this diagnosis do try to selfmedicate with alcohol smoking and using street drugs It is a painful situation as you well know He requires the help of highly experienced mental health professionals because he has what is known as an illness that requires MICA program intervention This stands for mentally ill chemically addicted I would think that he should be in individual counseling as well as receiving substance abuse counseling Usually there are local programs which have been developed for individuals who have a MICA profile When I worked in psychiatric hospitals we always had family programs in the evening where families of these patients would come together to offer each other support and suggestions on workable interventions I would suggest that you inquire of social service agencies in your area to see what might be available for you your family and your son If possible avoid TVVideo Games everyday or play by taking break within specific time interval If you play video games everyday continuously then definitely they affects on your eyes health Im sure this wont come as a shock to you but you need to quit smoking Are you aware that if your lungs get compromised enough you can have a heart attack Not the smell but the carcinogen cancercausing residue that may be on your clothes or skin This is called thirdhand smoke Before you hold this little infant take a shower wash you hair and change your clothes Andif you have plan on having a meaningful contact with this child as it grows you had better stop smoking now so you will be around to enjoy this new life No it is not very likely you would have inhaled enough during that very brief encounter to cause any effects What kind of apartment lets anyone some anything in the halls That is ridiculous so report it and complain You should not fail a drug test from your husbands marijuana use however there have been cases where second hand exposure to the smoke has tested positive in very sensitive lab tests It would be best not to be around the smoke but semen should not carry sufficient amounts of cannabis to cause a failed test The medical provider is quite skilled at smelling tobacco on your breath but there will not likely be any telltale signs of your smoking from just looking at your tonsils You are more prone to tonsillitis and other upper respiratory infections BECAUSE you are a smoker Dont be a fool my young friend When you start smoking young you are more likely to start having serious consequences at a younger age so dont be surprised in the future when a doctor tells you that you have cancer or some type of other serious cigaretterelated illness STOP NOWnot because it is illegal but because only stupid people and people who do not plan on living a long and healthy life smoke The only way you can test positive for marijuana is to be smoking or ingesting weed unless the urine test was somehow flawed or mixed up not likely OTC cold meds will NOT cause a positive THC result Get another test but no one is going to buy your story that you have not be indulging in cannabis if you test positive again You can get a blood or hair test as well as urine If the use of ecigarettes help you permanently STOP SMOKING then this could be useful to you Eventually you will want to be off of the ecigarettes as well It can be very difficult to know how much damage that 13 years of smoking has caused You can see a pulmonologist to have a few tests run Over time the lungs will repair a certain amount of damage but the legacy of your smoking will still remain as a health risk factor for years to come Obviously the longer you are a nonsmoker the better it will be for your entire body not just your lungs You can do this You are correct No one really knows of ecigarettes are safe when you are pregnant For some strange reason pregnant women have not volunteered to find out if it will hurt the baby or not My advice No ecigarettes The baby doesnt need the nicotine and you dont need it either You need to just STOP SMOKING Period No Just forgive yourself for a bit of human weakness and keep up your nonsmoking efforts It is still smoke and any substance that is brought into the lungs could have potential harm to your baby These things have NOT been tested so why take the chance Why would you consider smoking ANYTHING around a child This is very poor modeling as a parent If you must smoke those concoctions in a hookah  combinations that have never been tested on children exposed to secondary smoke  do so in private and away from the kids Children have enough bad exampled in their lifedont have the grow up thinking that smoking a hookah is just fine It is not a good idea for the patient or the doctor to smoke marijuana before any surgery It has certainly happened to others depending on the type and sensitivity of the testI guess you will know as soon as you have test I dont think your work place with test you for myrrh so unless you have been taking or smoking something else your drug test should be clean It is not likely that cigarette smoke in another apartment 50 feet away would have long term health consequences for you but if you are sensitive to that smoke smell you may have to move Marijuana can be quite stable so it is likely still in your systemenough to be detected by newer more sensitive tests I would have been best if you did not decide to smoke at a party Now you are flagged for failing not one but two tests Many people try to beat the drug tests so unless you get a 0 amount detected it will be reported as positive A good psychologist therapist or psychiatrist can help you overcome this fear using a variety of techniques This can be fixed Not a good ideatoo much nicotine Yes moderate smoking is still harmful That is like asking how much poison should I take every day before it becomes harmful You are nearly a nonsmoker so why not just go all the way and stop completely Stopping things that you enjoy are difficult I know but in the case of cigarettes there are really no safe limits Secondary smoke and even thirdhand smoke has been found to be harmful so even a pack a week is going to cause problems over time Clearly the more cigarettes that you smoke the worse your risk becomes While you are pleased to have cut down our 12 pack a day habit to a pack a week you need to do your body one more favor by stopping altogether You can do it If you are crazyor have a desire to be crazy Well obviously you completely stop smoking weed or hanging out with people who do There are no magic weed detoxification methods The residuals should clear in about a month after you completely stop No drinking alcohol cigarettes or other drugs either This baby is dependent on YOU starting at the moment of conception and for the rest of hisher life You are going to be a motheryou life will change or need to change forever  None How many bullets does it take to kill someone How much poison can you ingest and still live Any person regardless of age who smokes even ONE cigarette is a fool Addiction is unlikely to occur with that few cigarettes but addiction isnt the issueit is health Have him take a big inhalation on a cigarette and then blow it through several folded layers of white tissue That black stuff you see is only a fracture of what sticks to the lining of the lungs and that black stuff is loaded with cancercausing chemicals Sohow many cigarettes can one smoke over a lifetime before that get lung throat or mouth cancer I dont know but only a fool would take the chance to find out Smoking adversely affects that stomach For instance smokers have a higher incidence of stomach ulcers so it would not surprise me that your smoking is causing issues in your esophagus and stomach Your body is sending you a message to STOP SMOKING  A wise person would listen and comply Smoking anything can cause a sore throat You should wait at least 60 or 70 more years before you consider smoking again Specific recommendations regarding smoking after a tooth extraction should ONLY come from the oral surgeon that did the work Those sutures are most likely the dissolvable type and it can take weeks for them to dissolve Call your oral surgeon and serious consider permanent smoking cessation This article should answer your question httpwwwwebmdcombreastcancernews20110301smokingmayincreasebreastcancerrisk No smoking does not usually cause any abnormal thyroid tests but a person with COPD should NEVER SMOKE You need to do what you can to stop smoking or the COPD will become progressively worse Discuss your thyroid tests with your doctor since there are many different types of tests I dont knowthat is up to surgeon and the anesthesiologist so you will need to discuss your case individually with them There are no set rules about this so they will make the decision I am surprised that you are still showing positive drug test results two months after not using marijuanaare you sure about those dates If you are gaining weight then eat LESS of that healthy food and exercise more Your body will eventually drop the extra weight if you keep up your new healthy habits There are no magic solutions other than this By stopping cigarettes you have given your bodyyour ONLY bodyand your family the best gift ever  THC will not likely be detected in a routine urine test only a specific drug screen Whether it will show up in your body from someone else smoking marijuana in a vehicle and NOT you is iffyit depends on the sensitivity of the drug screen and the amount you may have innocently inhaled NoI think the baby will be absolutely thrilled that you have stopped smoking It maysmoking increases the risk of just about anything including pancreatic cancer Alcohol use definitely increases the risk of pancreatitis If this person you is the one who is smoking then STOP Rather than worry if smoking is a specific risk factor be more concerned that a person can have more than one medical issue If this person continues to smoke pancreatitis may be the least of their problems I dont think that parents who use methamphetamines should be caring for ANY childrenat any age It is not the smoke but the drug use that is the problem It is difficult enough being a parent but when the parent is chemically impaired even if they think they are not it can be dangerous In older children watching their parents smoke crystal meth is not the best modeling as you know Unless your company is willing to get you a fullhead respiratory system there is really no simple mask system I am absolutely appalled that you have to inhale secondary smoke at your place of employment NO ONE should be smoking around youperiod If they cannot provide you with a smokefree environment while you are pregnant then they should be required to pay your FULL salary for you to stay home I think it is time for you to call the labor board and complain Do you work in the United States No meth users do not have parasitic worms they just think they do Meth users will tweakpick at their skin pick and scratch until their bodies look terrible There is really little that can be done over the Internet other than to offer you some advice I dont know your husbands complete medical history or have any way to medically evaluate his memory issues but he does have some obvious contributory factors tobacco marijuana use poor nutrition a guess insomnia due to unknown factors and perhaps many many other issues He will need to see a medical professional to start the evaluation process assuming you will be able to convince him to do so Encouraging him to give up tobacco and marijuana may be futile but at least you can try and work on him I am sure that it is not a good idea Your lungs are having a difficult time as it is recovering from your pneumonia so why make things worse with cigar smoke You may not feel that you are inhaling but enough smoke is getting into your respiratory tract to cause an inflammatory response increase mucous production and trigger a new round of coughing I am sorry that you are stuck in your house and are bored but smoking a cigar when you have pneumonia is not wisenot wise at all Some authorities believed that smoked anything is not really good for you Depending on how a product is smoked smoke can contain residue that may be carcinogenic cancercausing It is not your age that is the factor but rather the possibility that smoked food my be hazardous at any age Moderation is the key so an occasional piece of smoke salmon is not the same as a cigarette Has her prescribed any prescription medications that may contain cannabis Why were they drug testing your elderly mother anyway These tests have to be order for a reason cannabis does not just show up on a routine urinalysis It doesntunless the test was wrong or mixed up with another specimen can happen While there are occasional falsepositive tests for cocaine these tend to be rare If you have used cocaine in ANY form like snorting it or on a cigarette your test may be positive Repeat the test of course if you know in your heart that you have NEVER had contact with cocaine You can also ask for two tests  one sent to a different lab I dont believe this combination has ever been studiednothing in the literature so my personal recommendation to you is dont do it or you could theoretically become the first BactrimMarijuana adverse reaction case You should tell BOTH your surgeon and your anesthesiologist about your marijuana use A routine urine sample is not a drug test but your surgical team MUST have this information so be open and honest Only if you smoke instead of drink water Cigarettes do not cause dehydration but a reduced intake of fluids andor diarrhea certainly can THC can be stored in the body fat for weeks especially a heavy user I am not sure at 41 days if he will test positive or no but he can do his OWN test to be sure Many drug tests are very sensitive and some are using hair samples instead of urine or blood There is really nothing he can do to clear the THC fasterit is what it is I dont knowI guess you will just have to wait and find out Cannabis is fatbound can can be detected for several weeks but this is variable depending on the amount you use and how well your body eliminates it variable Some urine tests are more sensitive than others too You should ALWAYS tell your anesthesiologist and surgeon about your marijuana use Let them decide if your occasional use is significant or not You and your baby will be fine but you need to keep tract of where you put your beverage next time It is not a good idea to be pregnant and get exposed to any secondary smokeperhaps one of those smokers mindlessly put the cigarette in your bottlecan Nicotine is a powerful stimulant and you can definitely get reactions While your anxiety may be more complicated than just nicotine it would obviously be best for you not to smoke anymore There are medications that can help but you will need to see your medical provider to have them prescribed The effects of the nicotine exposure should be waning each day so it is unlikely that you will have any permanent effects Again since anxiety can be much more complex as to the causes seeing your health care provider would be advised Nosinusitis is not contagious Now that you have a son this is another big reason not to smoke If my sexual partner smoked I would not have sex with them I am not sure what you mean by weakness unless you are talking about the will NOT to smoke You will not likely have any longterm health effects from doing this once but dont make it a habit All forms of smoking is bad for the lungs but our body does have a remarkable way of forgiving these isolated transgressions Take care of your lungs my friend Why take the chance I found this article very informative httpkellymomcombfcanibreastfeedlifestylemarijuana I guess you can come in work in my clinic or volunteer at a daycare center Those things should get you sick Some people are just blessed with a wonderful protective immune system The average person gets about three colds a year you are getting one Now if you would just quit smoking and start eating better there would be no stopping you Even people with great immune systems can get better I have an Aunt who never smoked ate very sensibly mostly foods that she grew herself very little meat worked hard in the garden and around the house She passed away this morning at 98a long and healthy life I wish that for you True asthma is an allergic disorder Smoking can cause an asthmalike condition called emphysema or COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as well as cancerof course Only a fool would choose to smoke While smoking including second hand smoke has many negative effects on your health it is not clear that it has a significant effect on seizures While strong stimulants such as cocaine can cause seizures the milder stimulant effects of nicotine and caffeine dont seem to impact on seizure frequency except with extreme excess use It is not physically dangerous to smoke and use Zyban at the same time But you will seriously lower your chance of breaking your smoking habit if you smoke after the date you set to stop smoking Ill tell you the same thing my OBGYN told me about cigarettes and coffee while I was pregnant You can have them  if you want to It technically is your choice your child doesnt yet have the luxury of making one for themselves they have to live with yours They are always looking for statistics to go off of for future reference Its up to you if you want your child to be used as a statistic or not If you it you will never know because you will be dead Excess alcohol can mess with erections as can tobacco Plus stress fatigue anxiety worry performance pressures guilt fear  pretty much anything involving your thinking can block erections If you have never had good erections it could be hormonal or other medical problems so you should talk to a urologist for a basic evaluation

think using a mouse would do that but if its in your right arm Id definitly go get checked out I have had several friends that have been on probation and have tried to use the response that they failed a urinalysis because of friends that have smoked around them Each time their probation officer has told them that in order to get even trace amounts in their system they would have to be literally inside of a car with the windows up and smoke large amounts I think that both you and your husband have taken adequate precautions to protect your child  Probably not my lungs didnt but they wont get worse no you will not pass Have you tried a condom You should definatly go to a doctor about that 12 years is a very long time If you are smoking a pack a day that could be a HUGE reason why
