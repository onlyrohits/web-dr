the eye and specially conjunctivaAccording to me your conjunctiva might have got damaged due to certain reason Conjunctiva is a soft smooth transparent membrane membrane covering the white part of our eye sclera  This membrane is vascular in nature and contains supply of blood vessels Due to extra pressure on the supplied vessels in the conjunctiva they may get burst sometime suspending the blood in the conjunctiva membrane This makes our eye red or pink blood vessels in conjunctiva are very much fragile Coughing Sneezing Straining the eye can cause pressure upon the blood vessels  which can cause flow of blood into the membrane  Your eye doctor is right for 3 weeks sleep with a teabag on your red marks that happened to my best friend and this cleared it right up  As a pediatric nurse i would say that the change in light intensity from indoor to bright sunlight is the cause Sunglasses are a good idea even in infancy to protect the eyes a most important commodity Put his glasses on before he steps outside to prevent trauma Most importantly take him to a Pediatric Ophthalmologist for a full exam not an Optomotrist May God Bless the Little Sweetheart You might want to read the big folded paper that comes with Lyrica Vision problems are a side effect of this medication and one of the reasons I chose not to take it When the possible side effects start more complications it is difficult to take the risk sinus infection sounds like u have the flu or cold and sinus an infection both  So whats your question You could try putting a mixture of baking soda and water on the effected areas and that should help clear it up in a few days Hello Greetings from Advanced Eye Hospital CCL  C3R CXL or Corneal Collagen Cross Linking is a technique in which the bonds in your cornea are strengthened Riboflavin a type of Vitamin B2 is first applied followed by treatment with Ultraviolet A Light While conventional collagen cross linking required that ones cornea be thicker than 400 microns it is not true today Today we have a newer technique called KXL wherein the time is drastically reduced from an hour to just about 3 minutes Also individuals whose corneas are thinner than 400 microns can now be considered for this procedure using this new technology If you suffer from Keratoconus and wish to ascertain whether you are a suitable candidate for this procedure do drop in to Advanced Eye Hospital Navi Mumbai for a comprehensive eye check by our Cornea Surgeon Regards Advanced Eye Team No you shouldnt but get a piece of paper towel damp and wipe it off of his eyes every time  Tooth infection A corneal abrasion is a scratch on the eyes cornea The cornea is the clear protective covering over the iris which is the colored part of the eye and the pupil  the black circle in the middle of the eye Its important both for vision and for protecting the eye If you poke your eye or if something gets trapped under your eyelid  such as dirt or sand  your cornea may become scratched When it does it can cause significant pain and discomfort If you get something in your eye do not rub it Try flushing it out with water or seek help from a doctor  UV protection is not related whatsoever to how dark the lens is The primary goal of sunglasses is to protect your eyes and your childrens eyes from UV light Once you make sure that everyones sunglasses provide 100 protection then the degree of tint can be an individual decision based on personal preference The amount of UV protection provided by a pair of sunglasses is independent of the amount of tint Some dark glasses can provide little UV protection and some lightly tinted glasses may provide 100 protection The key is to read the label on the sunglasses Look for an indication that the sunglasses provide 100 UV protection these glasses may be labeled UV400 instead Another key to the amount of UV protection will be the lens material Polycarbonate lenses generally provide 100 UV protection whereas CR39 plastic provides 88 protection and cheap triacetate lenses only confer 40 protection Health care professionals were not as aware of the longterm dangers of UV exposure many years ago I know that when I was growing up in the 60s and 70s there was no emphasis on UV protection for skin or eyes Experts now feel that childhood is indeed the critical time to protect the eyes from UV exposure There are several reasons for this First kids spend more time outdoors than adults this is likely true even in this day of video games and cable TV Second childrens pupils are larger as a percentage than those of adults It is estimated that 50 of ones lifetime exposure to UV light occurs by age 18 Unequal pupils is called anisocoria and is most commonly caused by HJorner syndrome or a Third nerve palsy In both conditions an abnormality or asymmetry of the lid will likely be noted With Horners the problem is on the side with the smaller pupil with 3rd nerve palsy the larger pupil is the problem side Other causes coud be trauma vision problems or even familial Insulin affects your vision because insulin lowers blood glucose levels which in turn effects the lens of the eye not because insulin has a direct effect on your eyes When your blood glucose sugar levels go up fluid enters the lens of your eyes and when your blood glucose goes down the fluid shifts out of your lens These changes in fluid in the lens cause blurred vision so both high and low blood glucose levels affect your vision As your blood glucose levels stabilize on insulin these shifts become less and your vision improves So be patient In most cases the blurry vision after you start insulin settles down Usually these vision changes resolve within a few days or weeks depending on how quickly your diabetes comes under control After examining your eyes your doctor will be in good position to hopefully reassure you that these vision changes are temporary Therefore unless you are really having serious vision problems wait until your blood glucose levels settle before having your vision tested for a new pair of glasses Nowadays there is a solution for each and every problem So no worries Hi Im sorry about your nephew And glad that he has a wonderful aunt I had a neighbour who had a autistic child she too was in denial of the fact that the child needed help She didnt even accept the opinion of her OBGyn who assisted in her childbirth This kid was 3 12 when he wouldnt even utter a word but was humming songs in sync Like wise Austin might have some special skill which you could nurture and approach thro that area for therapy at home It could be that  some people think denial or looking away makes the problem disappear We do know that it might be painful for the mother to hear such a thing about her child Probably you or other family members could take her for counselling first and make her realise that care and cure is available And you all are there to support them Wish you get all help for your little nephew Hi there My two year old also had that She ended up having to have an inhaler because her airways would inflate when she was active therefore causing her to have trouble breathing After she used the inhaler for a while it went away and now she is a healthy almost 4 year old We only ever used it the one time I would reccomend it good luck Hi Yellowing of the eyes is a type of jaundice I would make a doctor appointment  Normal eye pressure is debated Many eye experts use 1021 as being normal Your values of 23 and 29 are out of range high but not overly indicative of eye disease I know someone with glaucoma and pressures have been in the 40s With that background please allow me to answer your question directly Yes eye drops not laser are the preferred first treatment for high eye pressure value  It is possible that you have a medical condition called Trichomegaly which presents in the form of excessive eyelash growth Some of the conditions causing Trichomegaly are associated with eye infections I suggest that you withhold trimming of your eyelashes and instead to be assessed by your physician  A certain amount of edema tissue fluid buildup in the arms hands ankles and feet is a normal occurrence for a woman in her 3rd trimester of pregnancy Drinking additional amounts of water can be a helpful form of treatment for your edematous condition  I recommend that you contact your doctor about the swelling of your face and puffiness around your eyes It is important to eliminate a serious medical condition as the cause for your facial and eye symptoms One of those serious medical conditions is called preeclampsia Preeclampsia can cause a spike in blood pressure and result in kidney function irregularities Conclusion Most women experience swelling of the arms hands legs ankles and feet during pregnancy A sudden swelling of the face and puffiness around the eyes should be assessed by a medical professional I hope that this answer has been helpfulBest wishes for the upcoming birth of your child May labor and delivery be a positive experience full of joy I had the same experience in the past which spontaneously resolved itself My medical doctor explained to me that this occurrence can be a result of innocent voluntary and involuntary acts including eye rubbing sneezing straining contact lens and a host of others He called the condition sub conjunctiva hemorrhage a broken blood vessel in the eye Since the blood has nowhere to go it collects under the eyelid like hypertension can also cause leakage of blood vessels in the eye It is never a good idea to overlook this symptom Based the fact that a month has elapsed I suggest that you see your medical doctor who may make a preliminary diagnosis and refer you to an ophthalmologist for additional study and possible treatment Having giddiness feelings while thinking of something unpleasant may in itself be an inappropriate laughter response But experiencing negative neurological symptoms accompained with giddiness needs to be assessed by a medical professional The type of euphoria that you detail is typically a result of drug abuse or taking medications that are producing emotional sideeffects tic conditions tourette syndrome where outburst of laughter can occur anxiety sleep deprivation and other emotional and physical disturbances I suggest that you have a conversation with your family doctor who may order blood testing and complete a through evaulation of both your giddiness and balance defects That person may then refer you other medical professionals such as a neuroligist or psychologist to determine an exact diagnosis and treatment Your chemotherapy of a year ago is probably not related to the white of your eyes taking on a yellow color Sometimes yellowing of the eyes can be a sign of serious medical conditions such as liver disease It is best to be assessed by the family doctor obtain a complete physical receive some diagnostic blood work and possibly be referred to an appropriate medical specialist  It is good news that the eye condition was found early and that corrective actions can occur After the age of 9 years old many eye conditions remain for life Astigmatism may be an inherited trait It can present itself as blurred vision with sometimes headaches and squinting it is really not an eye disease Treatment may involve corrective glasses Laser surgical intervention is recommended by some eye professionals but is overall regarded as a controversial choice This controversy surrounds the fact that a childs eyes are still growing It is interesting that astigmatism in infants and toddlers sometimes self corrects itself as the child gets older Of course it could also not change or even get worse as the child gets older The below link is from a WebMD article talking about astigmatism httpwwwwebmdcomeyehealthastigmatismeyes I suggest that you take your son to at least 1 or 2 pediatric ophthalmologists to confirm the condition and to receive the latest and best treatment options Astigmatism in children is one case where one size does not fit all Eye treatment for young children is best individualized according to their unique problems  Here are my thoughts that are intended to be helpful 1 It is not normal to still be in pain two years after surgery 2 Anything is possible but I do not think that you had surgery without the break being repaired But it is very possible that the surgery was not successful or that damage occurred after the surgery 3 You should not be subjected to a life full of pain 4 By the way what happened to the original doctor who performed your surgery That individual had a responsibility to follow you postsurgically 5 You need to see a different doctor one that does take you seriously Taking of an xray would seem to be a necessary diagnostic tool that was not employed Having of an xray is rather routine cost effective and many times can even be done in the doctors office I am surprised at the omission of an xray in your case because doctors today can be held accountable for Failure to Diagnosis Chances are that at the age of 25 youve had a number of eye exams It is unlikely that AE would be missed during these exams and that your family has not noticed your eyes converging inwards Additionally AE may cause other eye abnormalities which you did not mention in your question As a matter of fact your vision was reported to be normal Most AE patients require treatment with bifocal glasses as a child It is not unusual for an individual during early adulthood to experience a temporary awkward tendency in maintaining eye contact with others Perhaps It is just a thought that what is happening is a normal growth and development phase where your social anxiety level is high With time and some work this condition can usually be overcome I suggest that you see your family doctor and have a complete physical exam Additionally be examined by an eye specialist Optometrist or Ophthalmologist at least once to either rule in or rule out diseases of the eye Once medical reasons are eliminated as a cause for your difficulty in maintaining eye contact then you can move forward and explore a possible anxiety disorder This response is being submitted with caring and respectful intentionsYou deserve a conclusive answer to your concerns by being evaluated in person by a medical professional Many of the over the counter pain relievers contain at least some common ingredients Since you do not really know which ingredient in these medications is causing the negative sideeffects it may be a good idea to discuss the reactions with the family doctor and to be referred to an allergist specialist Its really not the that she is reacting to but instead at least one of its ingredients Another valuable source of information is the neighborhood pharmacist This individual if the sideeffect is frequently seen in  may be familiar with the ingredient responsible for the negative reactions It sounds like you may have stopped taking antidepression medications on your own Many people either feel better or experience side effects that prompt them to stop taking the medication Stopping of antdepressants needs to be medically supervised by tapering and weaning methods It may have taken as long as 6 weeks for the medicine to take effect in your blood stream it only stands to reason that a person cannot safely stop this treatment in a risky cold turkeylike fashion According to a WebMD article symptoms of Antidepressant Withdrawal may be serious Symptoms most often occur within three days of stopping the antidepressant They may be mild and go away within about two weeks or end up causing catastrophic problems WebMD reports that symptoms can include In rare cases in people who have bipolar disorder antidepressant withdrawal has been known to trigger mania Withdrawal from certain older types of antidepressants called MAOIs has also though rarely been reported to cause confusion and psychotic symptoms In conclusion abruptly stopping antdepressants may cause physical problems emotional turmoil set your recovery back further from where you first started and even result in experiencing suicidal ideations  I recommend that you seek medical attention for your withdrawal symptoms Yes get another opinion from a retinal specialist Also get treatment options Dont know whats wrong Do know that you should see an eye doctor I would strongly suggest that you take him to a doctor since he has had lingering problems after the falls If he has not gotten better after so long it is unlikely to improve by just waiting Severe psychological events can potentially cause hallucinations but I think its rather uncommon for a panic attack to do so It would not be impossible however for you to have the panic attack first and the hallucination to begin afterwards Its possible that you simply noticed the visual disturbance the physical sensation of being afraid and that coming down from the panic left you physically or emotionally tired I would recommend that you tell someone if this happens again since a lot of other things can cause hallucinations Its possible that this was an isolated incident but it never hurts to be sure  First make an appointment with your doctor as it is probably pink eye which is contagious A warm tea bag placed on the eye with eye closed of course helps with crustys that may form and will also help with the excess of mucusand timepatience is needed as this may last up to 7 days yesand sometimes all he way around the whole eye Call your Doctor they will have all the answers that you need for post op recovery BLOOD PRESSURE You should see a doctor Ive suffered from migraines for years Medication has helped but by far the best thing I ever did was go on a glutenfree diet about 4 months ago Since then Ive had only 1 one migraine  hallelujah My 7year old boy has the same issue Did your neurologist find anything Id definitely give your pediatrician a call in the morning Purulent eye discharge can be a symptom of a bacterial conjunctivitis or sometimes even a sinus infection In the meantime warm compresses can help remove the discharge and will help him feel much better If the eye looks like it is bulging there is high fever or you have other concerns Id give your oncall doc a call tonight or head into a 24hour urgent care or ER It is never a bad idea to share your concerns with babys parents and see if they can pass along your concerns to the pediatrician Until 8 weeks of age we really dont expect babies to track with their eyes He might spend some brief moments staring at a face or looking at patterns with bright colors or shadows As the next few weeks come along I suspect that you will see him following your face or becoming more interested in watching a mobile I hope that helps alleviate some of your worry Congratulations on the new grandson A unibrow can be safely treated by a boardcertified dermatologist using a laser The doctor will protect your eyes with laser shields You would usually need three to five treatments about a month apart No waxing or plucking between laser treatments is allowed Usually a onceayear touchup is needed Ok well I dont know the solution but if you have no understanding of the tear gland or the orbicularis oculi it may help you to have a little medical insight Tunnel vision is a medical condition that results in a loss of peripheral vision As a result the patient can only see objects from within a circular field This condition has many possible causes including problems in the brain some eye diseases hallucinogenic drugs and certain extreme activities Blood loss to parts of the brain can lead to tunnel vision as can a tumor pressing against the optic never fibers A person who is exposed to air that has been contaminated by oils and hydraulic fluids such as may happen in an airplane and during hard exercise may also develop this condition Becoming ill while in an aircraft can cause temporary vision problems The pressure placed on the optic nerve causes the eye to lose retinal ganglion cells which can eventually cause the patient to go blind For some patients a loss of peripheral vision may be experienced prior to blindness Sounds like you may have the beginning stage of a sty Stys are normally found under the eye lid or along the eye lash area When I get a sty I take a small amount of rice and put it into a baggie and place the open baggie with a wash cloth under the baggie into the microwave heat it for one minute Remove the baggie and wash cloth seal the baggie then fold the wash cloth around the baggie this will be hot if you wish wrap another wash cloth around the baggie and first wash cloth to avoid burning yourself Apply to your eye to help with the swelling and help the sty to come to a head so it can pop on its own Do not try and pop a sty as this could lead to infection and a longer period of time to heal Allow the sty to pop on its own always If need be see your doctor if the swelling gets worse or is still swollen for more than a week If you have waterproof makeup chances are you do need an eye makeup remover to get that makeup off your eyes If you are using waterbased nonwaterproof then you can use your general cleanser to get your makeup off When you get that raccoon eyes you do need to wash afterwards Because that is makeup left on your skin so you do still need to wash afterwards to get all that makeup removed from around your eyes Dark circles are a problem for everybody and sleep is a critical factor thats a really good point However there are other things that people also do to make dark circles and discoloration around the eyes I have noticed that people who have allergies who tend to rub their eyes a lot will also have dark circles So you have to be aware of how much you are touching your eye Otherwise its really a matter of managing your stress getting enough sleep and drinking enough water because dehydration will also cause that change there Theres two different components that can cause discoloration around the eye One is pigment Thats what gives your skin color The other is blood supply So when you have a change in either or both of those two you see that change around the eye The skin around the eye is very thin so you notice it there before you see it on other parts of the face or body and thats just a very sensitive area The only thing you can really do is get a good concealer Hope your kids grow up fast and learn to sleep through the night or maybe close the door tighter As long as your kids are safe and you know they are okay I think that a little bit of discussion with your children about their sleep patterns if they are old enough might also help but you really have to get enough sleep There is just no other way around it Dermal fillers are used more and more often around the eyes with really great results When you see a dark circle under the eye it can be from two different things It can be from pigments or blood supply and those are the two main things When you also see a discoloration it could be because there is a shadow effect from the skin being sunken in that area or depressed or lower than the surrounding skin So by adding a dermal filler and putting the skin on a more even plane that alone takes away the shadow and makes the skin looks smoother You can also use brightening creams that contain ingredients like niacinamide sepiwhite mulberry root extract or hydroquinones that can even out the skin tone and when you add ingredients in like caffeine and the niacinamide as I just mentioned that also can help with the redness and altogether that will help that area look as good as possible You also have to add in getting enough sleep drinking enough water having a balanced diet managing your stress and if you have allergies you need to keep your allergies under control One thing you shouldnt do is have an injection around the eyes if you have active or uncontrolled allergies because that can make that area more puffy and can make the outcome less than optimal Look for undereye creams that contain retinoids niacinamide peptides and caffeine The next step is to see your dermatologist for an evaluation for a fractional CO2 procedure which can tighten and smooth the skin very nicely Be careful to also manage your salt intake get enough sleep and try not to rub the area around your eyes If you have allergiessinusitis be sure to keep them under control as much as possible since that can also contribute to the puffiness in this area The undereye area is also one place where stress shows very quickly so managing your stressors is helpful as well Undereye circles are due to a combination of factors  genetics allergies rubbing stress lack of sleep dehydration leftover makeup Look for products that contain peptides sepiwhite caffeine niacinamide mulberry root extract or retinoids Chin firming creams should contain retinoids peptides hyaluronic acid growth factors Speak with your dermatologist or plastic surgeon to see if a radio frequency procedure such as Thermage is appropriate for you The results in the chin area can be dramatic Any age really It is helpful to use an antioxidant under your sunscreen and again at night to help prevent wrinkles The most important antiaging cream you can use is sunscreen every day all yearround even if it is cloudy Damage from sun exposure is cumulative It is so much easier to prevent wrinkles than it is to fix them afterwards I like products that contain retinol niacinamide peptides and caffeine Dark undereye circles are due to several causes genetics allergies rubbing and stresslack of sleep Part of the issue is vascular due to the blood vessel network just under the skin and part is due to actual pigmentation It is important not to rub the area ever to control allergiessinusitis as much as possible to get enough sleep and to use a good concealer Look for undereye creams that contain ingredients such as niacinamide peptides and caffeine Be careful to also manage your salt intake get enough sleep and try not to rub the area around your eyes If you have allergiessinusitis be sure to keep them under control as much as possible since that can also contribute to the puffiness in this area The undereye area is also one place where stress shows very quickly so managing your stressors is helpful as well Avoid heavy eye creams that trap moisture into the skin and may cause puffiness Make sure you use a full face product with antiaging ingredients that deliver firmness and protect skin from UV damage and ensure you add a targeted eye cream or serums for extra care Look for undereye creams that contain ingredients such as niacinamide peptides and caffeine Be careful to also manage your salt

them afterwards I like products that contain retinol niacinamide peptides and caffeine So sorry to hear youre going through this I can think of few things worse than a sinus headache Your best bet is to make another trip to the doctor for a reevaluation of your symptoms It sounds like youre doing everything right in terms of taking your prescribed medications checking your shower for mold and mildew etc Since your symptoms have continued after finishing the antibiotics you were prescribed youd be welladvised to go back for further evaluation Your health care provider may want to try a different type of medication to help manage your symptoms In the meantime you can try taking overthecounter pain relievers as directed on the bottle This may help some with the pain Good luck to you Feel better soon Im sorry to hear youre experiencing this As a veteran of skin rashes I can relate This is probably not an emergency room situation Save the ER for those times when you experience chest pain or difficulty breathing A scaly itchy rash on the face can be caused by many things including eczema a likely culprit and psoriasis The only way to tell for sure is to get a physical exam from your primary care provider If the diagnosis is eczema or psoriasis your PCP will be able to tell you how to treat it Id be cautious using Caladryl calamine lotion near the eyes If it gets in your eyes it can cause irritation If you have no known drug allergies you may apply some overthecounter hydrocortisone cream temporarily until you can see your doctor Keep in mind though you want the rash to be visible when you visit your health care provider So take some good photos of it before you use any treatments Best to you Well if youre thinking about this as a doityourself project Id say dont Theres really no good way to remove a mole or growth on the eyelid by yourself This requires the precision of an experienced medical professional But lets not get the cart before the horse You dont even really know for sure if these growths are moles keratoses basically an overgrowth of skin cells or malignancies Id suggest you see a dermatologist to have these growths assessed A dermatologist also should be able to take care of the growths on your eyelid and give you some options regarding the growths on your body Wishing you all the best Usually its OK to wear contacts when youve experienced a  You may want to keep extra wetting solution on hand to lubricate your eyes throughout the day But assuming no swelling or other symptoms and assuming the hemorrhage wasnt caused by trauma theres probably no reason not to wear your contacts Hope this helps Im sorry to hear your motherinlaw is going through this but Im glad she had glaucoma ruled out Severe should not be ignored Eye pain generally is not a symptom of agerelated  Id suggest your motherinlaw make an appointment to see an ophthalmologist as distinct from an optometrist to have this evaluated An ophthalmologist is a medical doctor MD who is specially trained to deal with highlevel eye problems such as trauma glaucoma and other serious eye diseases I wish you both all the best Usually a red streak on the surface of the white part of the eyeball isnt anything serious In fact many people wake up with these streaks due to rubbing their eyes or something during sleep As long as youre not having any problems such as blurred vision or partial loss of vision you probably are safe to take a watchful waiting approach to see if the red streak clears up on its own Best of luck Im sorry youre going through this Its not uncommon to mistake one medication for another It happens to the best of us It sounds like you did everything right You flushed your eye and sought medical attention It would not be uncommon for you to have a dry swollen feeling in the lower lid after placing camphophenique in the eye You dont say how long ago this happened Its possible the situation will clear up You can continue lubricating the eye with plain saline eye drops such as Natures Tears brand Bausch  Lomb brand saline drops for sensitive eyes or any generic brand of sterile saline solution Do not use plain tap water as this will only irritate the eye further If the problem doesnt get better within a week of the time you sought medical attention you might make an appointment with an ophthalmologist a medical doctor who treats eye problems or your primary care provider to get reevaluated I hope you feel better soon Im sorry youre going through this but it sounds like youre receiving appropriate treatment for your  In answer to your question there is some evidence that are effective in helping treat conditions like AMD Lutein specifically has been studied for its effectiveness in macular degeneration though results are still considered inconclusive This is simply because enough studies have not been done If your ophthalmologist eye doctor has recommended you take a specific vitamin supplement for your eyes then I suggest you follow this recommendation If your sight is failing due to AMD you want to take every opportunity to stop the disease in its tracks Hope this helps While its extremely rare to be allergic to Synthroid generic name levothyroxine that doesnt mean its impossible Synthroid is a brand name It contains certain binders and dyes that could conceivably cause an allergic reaction even though this medication has been used safely by millions of people Rest assured if it turns out you are allergic to something in Synthroid there are plenty of other options for you Generic versions of levothyroxine abound Your health care provider certainly can let you try different preparations to see which one works for you without causing an allergic reaction However its also possible something else entirely is causing your problems You should see your health care provider as soon as possible to try to determine what is causing your symptoms I hope you feel better soon Yeah youre good to go Cold cream to the eye isnt going to make you go blind or anything Obviously its wise to rinse your eyes if you get a big glob in there or if your eyes feel irritated after use But a small amount of cold cream in your eye isnt going to kill you Cold cream has been used for decades as a facial cleanser Id think if it were dangerous wed know by now All the best to you Im sorry to hear about your accident Ouch I certainly would suggest you get this checked out It sounds like you might have a  Concussions can vary from mild to severe If youre having pain around one eye my concern would be that you damaged some of the delicate structures around your eye socket That definitely deserves to be checked by a medical professional as well as getting an assessment of your head injury in general Because this happened over a week ago I dont necessarily think you need to go to an emergency room Id suggest phoning your primary care provider and explaining the situation so they work you in as soon as possible If they cant get you in within a day or two then I guess Id suggest you head for an urgent care I mean on the one hand this doesnt sound like an emergency anymore but on the other hand it probably needs to get checked out sooner rather than later Just for future reference if you ever hit your head hard enough to black out even for a moment or if you experience dizziness fuzzy memory nausea or any of the other  you should go to the emergency room I wish you all the best and hope you feel better soon This is something that deserves to be checked out right away by a health care professional especially if your vision is changed or limited in your right eye Its possible to rupture a blood vessel in the white of the eye called  This can be triggered by something as simple as sneezing Occasionally there is pain involved as well as mild swelling of the eyelid Its not possible to diagnose your eye problem in a forum like this because you need someone to conduct a physical examination to see whats going on Chances are youre experiencing a subconjunctival hemmorhage which usually is benign doesnt cause any harm But youll want a health care provider to tell you that in person Good luck to you Im sorry to hear youve lost a in your eye Its not as uncommon as you might think The good news is its impossible for a contact lens to actually get behind your eye Usually what happens when a soft contact lens magically disappears is it gets dislodged from the cornea and stuck under the upper eyelid Sometimes a soft lens can get folded in half so when you eventually find it it may look distorted You can usually get the lens unstuck by put some wetting solution into your eye and blinking rapidly several time to bring the lens into view If that doesnt work try adding more wetting solution and gently turning your upper eyelid insideout This can pop the lens away from the upper lid If none of these solutions work you can always call your eye care professional for more advice or even an exam to find that darn contact lens and get it out Hope this helps Im sorry to hear youre experiencing this Chronic sinus problems are not uncommon and unfortunately there isnt always a good solution to fixing them In answer to your question No ear wax and sinus problems are not related also called cerumen is a combination of skin cells skin oils dust and other debris that can build up in the ear canal the outer portion of the ear People obsess about ear wax sometimes but unless your health care provider tells you to do something about the wax you can simply clean the ear canal with a damp washcloth Dont go poking cotton swabs in there The swooshing sound youre describing when you stand up quickly may or may not be related to your sinuses or your  Many people experience a phenomenon called   which is fancy talk for a sudden drop in blood pressure when standing You could possibly hear this when it occurs Or you could have fluid in your Eustachian tubes Only a health care provider can tell for sure Id suggest you continue to see your family doctor about the problem and discuss whether or not she would refer you to a different ENT doctor There may be new treatments available since you last investigated this problem Hope this helps Thats a good question Youd think a stye would have cleared up by now First off I would suggest seeing one doctor repeatedly instead of going from doctor to doctor Seeing the same doctor for a given condition offers continuity of care Perhaps youve been going to urgent care facilities where you dont get a choice of which doctor you see If possible get set up with a primary care provider and get started on solving the stye problem Its impossible to tell whats going on without performing a physical exam so the only advice I can give you is to go back to the doctor  preferably the last one you saw for the condition Its possible youve developed a second eye condition that has nothing to do with the stye Sometimes coincidences happen Wishing you well I think youre probably referring to a twitchy eyelid which is medically referred to as  Blepharospasm is a very common condition It is not serious in any way Often stress can trigger blepharospasm so you might ask yourself if youve been unusually stressed lately Even if you havent blepharospasm can come out of the blue for no reason It usually goes away just as quickly and unexpectedly If youre talking about your actual eyeball twitching thats another story You should see an eye doctor to determine what is causing this to happen Involuntary eyeball movement can signal an underlying condition that requires treatment by a medical doctor Wishing you well Id suggest you consult a medical professional about this It could be something as simple as dry eyes due to the winter season but since these symptoms came on so suddenly and severely it also could be that you have developed an eye infection called  Until you can get this diagnosed be sure to wash and dry your hands thoroughly many times a day especially before touching your eyes If this is conjunctivitis its highly contagious Even if its not pinkeye you dont want to risk spreading any possible infection to others Hope this helps In general basic first aid for any is constant flushing with water preferably distilled water but tap water will do for a minimum of 15 minutes While youre doing this have someone else call 911 for emergency assistance The flushing should be gentle but continuous Gently hold the eye open while allowing the water to run across the eyeball and down into the sink Its helpful to hold your head sideways at a 90degree angle to accomplish this When emergency medical assistance arrives try to give them the container of the chemical you got in your eye This will help them determine what further treatment you need Hope this helps This is a very interesting and not uncommon occurrence believe it or not Of course its impossible to diagnose whats going on with your eye within a forum like this If the eye is very bloodshot youd do well to see a health care provider about it Usually these red streaks on the white part of the eye are no big deal but you dont want to take chances with your sight right The red streaks are caused by congested blood vessels in that area of your eye If it only happens in the right eye it makes me wonder if you tend to sleep on your right side Gravity could cause increased blood to build up in the vessels of your right eye for example Other things than can cause red streaks to the inner part of the white of the eye include rubbing coughing sneezing and high blood pressure And that last cause is just one good reason to get checked by a health care provider Best wishes to you When you look at your eyes in the mirror you see three basic colors the white of your eyeball the colored part of the iris and the black of the pupil Lets look at these in a little more detail Everyones eyeball is white Its just how theyre made Everyones pupil is black because the pupil is actually an opening that allows light to go inside the eyeball The pupil looks black because theres no light inside the eye to illuminate it If there were the pupil might look bright white or even orange as if it were glowing Wouldnt that be cool The iris is the colored part of the eyeball The iris is not a muscle but it does expand and contract to control the size of your pupil and by extension how much light gets inside your eye The color of your iris is genetically determined Genetics is complex business so I wont go into it here Suffice it to say you cant use any product to lighten darken or otherwise change the color of your iris The color is hardcoded into your DNA If you are unhappy with the color of your eyes the only way to change it is with contact lenses That said I would tell you not to obsess over your eye color Theres no such thing as too dark or too light Beauty is in the eye of the beholder pun intended Try to love your eye color because it is absolutely unique in the universe Wishing you well Youre wise to ask questions like this I suggest you ask them directly of the medical professional who is treating you Your questions are legitimate and you can be assure your physician will give you straight answers In general Botox botulinumtoxinA has a good safety track record To my knowledge there are no reported instances where it has caused anaphylaxis or has traveled throughout the body though this has been reported with other botulinumtoxin products One of your concerns is about having repeated injections There are two issues to that aspect of your question First is that no one develops an allergy to a substance on the first exposure The major symptoms you describe anaphylaxis breathing issues are related to major allergic reactions If youve had three injections without an allergic response then you probably dont need to fear an allergic reaction at this point The other thing about the issue of repeated injections is that Botox only remains active for about 90 days After three months the botulinumtoxin has been fully metabolized by the body So youre not adding on to the amount of Botox in your system Youre replenishing it After the botulinumtoxin exits your system it no longer works Unless you get another dose your lazy eye problem will return Keep in mind I am not a physician As I said at the beginning you should address all of your concerns with the doctor who is treating you with Botox He or she will welcome your questions Wishing you well Im sorry to hear youre going through this It sounds awful First thing WASH YOUR HANDS very thoroughly before and after touching that eye In the event it turns out you have pinkeye you can easily spread it to others with your fingers Plus you dont want to contaminate your ailing eye with any other germs when you touch it Second what youre describing is not normal There are several possible explanations for your swollen eye but you need an examination by a medical professional to get a diagnosis If the swelling and gunk are confined to just one eye it could be a symptom of a foreign body in the eye  so Never take chances with your vision I suggest you either go to urgent care or make an appointment as soon as possible with your primary care provider Wishing you well Im sorry youre dealing with all of this It sounds miserable While nothings impossible its highly doubtful the steroid treatment caused the symptoms that developed in January Even though youve been thoroughly checked out if the symptoms persist you should consider continuing to follow up on them Many disease processes develop slowly over time This means an initial workup all those tests you had done wont always reveal an answer If you get tested later something may show up I want to add also that I wouldnt jump to a conclusion of cancer or precancer Nothing in your description would lead me to think cancer Id just recommend following up again with your health care provider until the problem gets resolved Take care Sorry youre going through this Unfortunately its not possible to diagnose this problem in an internet forum You need an examination This will determine the cause of the bump Many things can cause a bump like the one you describe If its near your teeth it could be an abscess If its in the fleshy part of your skin it could be a cyst It could also be something scary like a cancer This is why you should see a health care provider He or she will be able to tell you what to do to treat this bump The sooner you have a diagnosis the better Wishing you all the best Im sorry to hear this elderly lady is going through this The symptom you describe is worth at least a call to the patients primary care physician If she develops sudden difficulty breathing or swelling of the lips or tongue you need to call 911 for immediate medical attention If the situation has been going on for some time this lady needs to be seen by a health care provider A number of conditions can cause swollen eyelids and its important for her to be examined in order to get a correct diagnosis If the problem came on suddenly I would suspect an allergic reaction This could be caused by a new medication a new soap an animal in the house bedbugs or many other things If the situation doesnt clear up quickly then a visit to the doctor is in order Again If this lovely elder lady develops any lifethreatening symptoms please seek emergency medical attention immediately Wishing you all the best Im sorry youre going through this Unfortunately its impossible to diagnose something like this without a physical examination Id suggest you return to the doctor if possible the same one you saw last time Seeing the same doctor multiple times for the same ailment helps create an accurate history of the problem Also your health care provider can for example compare the size of the lesion now to its size when you were last seen This information can be valuable for coming to a diagnosis In answer to your question could it be cancerous again I have to say I dont know If the growth is inside your eyelid then Id say the chances are its not cancerous If the growth is on your eyelid such as within or below your lash line then Id say its slightly more possible this could be a cancer but overall not very likely Cancers of the eyelid arent all that common Your best bet is to return to your health care provider for a reevaluation Hope this helps Im sorry youre going through this It sounds unnerving Unfortunately theres no way to diagnose this problem without doing a physical exam Many things could cause such swelling from a serious sinus infection to an abscessed tooth Your best bet is to contact your health care provider for an appointment as soon as possible If you begin to have severe pain or start running a fever over 101F then you may want to consider visiting an urgent care facility to get this checked out I wish you all the best and hope you feel better soon Im sorry youre going through this I want to caution you however that you should never selfadminister antibiotics Its this type of usage that is causing a rise in the development of antibioticresistant bacteria Your best bet is to see a medical professional Your condition can only be diagnosed through a physical exam and possibly some other testing such as a throat swab or blood work It could as you speculate be a virus If it is it should clear up in 714 days No antibiotics required However it could be something other than a virus Many conditions can cause the symptoms youre describing from an inflamed salivary gland to an abscessed tooth The only way to find out is to visit a health care provider I wish you all the best Sorry to hear youre going through this No fun Assuming youre not allergic to ibuprofen Advil and youre not taking any other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents naproxyn aspirin prescription pain relievers with NSAIDs in them you should be AOK to take some ibuprofen for the pain If you have any questions about this though feel free to ask your pharmacist first Dont forget to take ALL of your antibiotics Dont be that person who gets to the final two pills and decides its too much of a hassle to finish the bottle Dont do it Take them all Its important Feel better soon Im sorry to hear youre going through this Id be worried too Its not possible to tell from the information you provided if your eye doctor believes the raw sore on your eye is due to the dry eyeball rubbing on the eyelid in other words sort of like a rug burn or is caused by something else entirely Usually small that is a spot on the surface of the eyball that has been scratched or rubbed heal up within a couple of days Because yours has not I would suggest going back to the doctor for some followup care Corneal abrasions by themselves dont usually cause blindness I would suggest you ask your doctor what the potential outcomes are for your particular situation He or she is in the best position to tell you what to expect I hope you feel better soon You need to seek immediate medical attention What youre describing could be a symptom of a or  Either one needs to be treated quickly Obviously the only way to properly diagnose this problem is to see a healthcare provider preferably an ophthalmologist Please call one as soon as possible and describe your symptoms so they will get you a prompt appointment I wish you all the best with this Im sorry to hear this It sounds at the very least annoying Without more details its impossible to tell whats going on here If the swelling and redness is confined to the small area between the eyes it could be caused by anything from a mosquito bite to a pimple and dont cause swelling but they do cause flaky patches that could look raised or welted If the symptoms dont get better you certainly can take your mother to her primary care provider to have this looked at I hope your mom feels better soon I would say yes seek immediate medical attention Obviously its impossible to diagnose the situation in a forum like this but your daughter could be experiencing an allergic reaction This should be addressed as soon as possible I hope everything turns out OK These are serious symptoms that deserve to be investigated immediately While many conditions could cause the symptoms you describe a major condition with these symptoms is  And stroke ideally should be treated within 3 hours of the onset of symptoms Even if the symptoms have resolved by now I urge you to seek medical treatment At the very least call the individuals primary health care provider to report what has happened The provider may give you further instructions I wish you both all the best Interestingly yes the two things could be related And you should get this checked out by a doctor as soon as you can Under certain circumstances its possible for the uninjured eye to react to an injury to the opposite eye This is a condition that needs to be treated because it can get worse Usually though this sort of situation occurs when theres a fairly serious injury to the opposite eyeball itself Thus the symptoms youre experiencing in the right eye could indicate a more serious injury than you thought to the left eye While this isnt an emergency Id recommend you see a doctor at your earliest convenience to find out whats going on No sense taking chances with your vision Best to you It is quite unlikely that the fog has to do with your eyes Unless you are crying your eyes would not produce that amount of moisture More likely it is your breath The air in the room is probably dry and there may be an air current directed at your face blowing your breath back at your eyes Sometimes irritation from paint fumes or new carpet can irritate the nose and eyes You can try warm compresses to the eyes antihistamine or overthecounter allergy eye drops Usually this gets better If these dont help or you develop pain in the eye or vision changes you should see an eye doctor to have an eye exam to make sure there is not an infection or other problem Go online or go to a place that sells glasses Bring a subscription Every child is different and it sounds from your description that your son has learned some language skills At 3 according to

lentils are good sources of iron Here are some other sources Chicken liver Clams mollusks mussels Cooked beef and turkey Breakfast cereals enriched with iron 1 cup cooked beans 1 cup spinach 1 ounce nuts peanuts almonds walnuts etc 1 cup of rice There are also foods that can hinder iron absorption To absorb the most iron from foods avoid drinking coffee or tea or consuming calciumrich foods milk cheese and yogurt with meals containing ironrich foods To improve absorption eat ironrich foods along with a good source of vitamin C For example orange juice broccoli or strawberries are rich in vitamin C For more foods that are rich in iron follow this link  Its normal in the first few weeks for a babys eyes to move in different directions such as having one eye turn inward toward the nose while the other looks straighta condition called strabismus Most babies outgrow this problem by the time they are a few months old Babies whose eye alignments do not improve by 3 or 4 months of age should see an ophthalmologist who is trained in caring for infants Sometimes the shapes of the eyes can make it look like a babys eyes are crossing so if youre not sure have your pediatrician check it out It can be helpful to take a picture of your babys eyes when they do not appear to be aligned so the doctor can see the suspected problem in action  yes dont take if you dont need taking prednisone

should rinse out your eye with cold water If that does not work then put some eye drops in you eye If you have loose eyelashes then you should pull out the loose ones The reason that your eyelashes keep falling out is because you are growing new ones But that happens with everybody So there is no need to panic every time your eyelashes fall out Sleep Apnea is a possibility Either the doctor is

be caused by stress Does he respond to the calling of his name or if you move your hand in front of his face while doing those things Also is he aware that he has done it It does sound like an absence

Detachments etc Before making any recommendations I would really need some additional information about your daughter and the medications she is using It is unlikely that a medication for impetigo or

effects from combining the two Side effects common with decongestants include rapid heartbeat jitters insomnia loss of appetite and increased blood pressure Sudafed is safe to take with Rhinocort and

dehydrated the eyes stop producing tears which can lead to eye strain vision problems and severe dry eyes Dry eyes are caused by the lack of natural tears in the eye  tears are necessary so the eyes receive proper nourishment and stay free of foreign matter that could cause irritation and infection In order to relieve dry eyes it is imperative to rehydrate by drinking plenty of water eye drops that lubricate the eye and wash away irritants are also a temporary solution for dry eyes Preventing dehydration is simple if you make sure to drink plenty of water rehydrate after sweating and cut down on intake of sodium alcohol caffeine and highprotein foods Another common cause of dry eyes is the consumption of certain medicines Medications that treat asthma and medications that manage high blood pressure are two of the most common types that can cause dry eyes If you already experience dry eyes its important to let your doctor know so you dont get a prescription that may further irritate your eyes Do hope that this helps you Good Luck Hi Just out of interest why not try cutting back on the computer for a while and take it from there also try taking the screen brightness down

modern way would be perhaps its still the same Thanks to the UKs NHS found you this Treating a lazy eye The majority of cases of lazy eye can be treated usually in two stages The underlying problem is first corrected This can be done using glasses to correct the focus of the eye which often helps to correct a squint as well The child is then encouraged to use the affected eye again This can be done with eye patches to cover the stronger eye or using eye drops to temporarily impair the vision in the strong eye Treatment is often effective but its a gradual process taking many months to work So there you go I was nearly right Good Luck Hi See Above Answer Hi If there late teenagers I would say they have been taken drugs of some kind if this is still going on get them to an ER if in the

a fever and feed a cold if the cold does break try some very good cheese and onion sandwichs good mature cheddar thick slices of red onions and slice some garlic in as well for the extra kick the last one just before bed if your eyes water when your eat them its about right Hope this helps you Good Luck Hi My first question would be just how much have you been masturbating before this some of the things your talking about are side effects or over masturbating You can see how just not masturbating for a couple of days how the head aches are going Now if you want to get better the thing would be to take an 8 week break from masturbating and any sexual contact around week 4 you should start to get nocturnal erections back along with morning woods As this carriers on you still do not masturbate till you have done the 8 weeks what this is doing is rebooting your system your body is a great healer if you let it Do hope this helps you Good Luck well like i said ive been too busy at the job so havent masturbated in over a month I noticed it when the morning wood started turning into morning rubber  This sounds like a terrible idea to be honest Especially since its not for a medical reason I wouldnt do anything like that unless I had an ailment like Pinkeye and my doctor had recommended it to me as a treatment You should go see a doctor immediately Ive experience that feeling and its usually because I didnt eat enough during the day before my workout and I pushed myelf too hard If you are overexherting yourself then it could be that you have low blood sugar and it is causing your dizziness and making you feel light headed If you are not eating enough during the day before a strenusous workout this could be a side effect I would try to eat a healthy meal that contains a good balance of proteincarbsnutrients try something like a chicken breast and a small sweet potato and maybe a small dinner roll Give your food some time to settle an hour or two then during your workout try to sip on a gatorade or Vitamin water Try not to over do it when you work out sometimes people push themselves too hard and it can results in injury as well If you are still experiencing those symptoms after trying this then I would see your doctor to make sure its not something more serious Well obviously the irritation is because there is a foreign object in your eye But if you wear a lot of eye makeup then this could be making the irritation worse than normal Also if you are constantly touching your eyes and eyelashes that might be causing them to fall out faster Try using less makeup but if you have to wear it then switch to the regular mascara not the water proof kind and that might lessen the irritation It is probably something called a milia which is basically a small cyst that is not harmful Its common in newborns but can also appear on adults If it bothers you you can talk to your dermatologist about removing it Its normal to still be a little sleepy during the day Everybody needs a nap every once in a while Especially if you are sitting in a dimly lit room warm temperatures have a full stomach and listening to a boring lecture happened to me all the time in college instantly those are typical allergic reaction especially she has identified those that triggers it those laboratory findings got nothing to do w allergies HPylori are microorganism usually found in stomach and they are the one causes gastritis and stomach ulcers blood type probably got nothing to do w allergies but sometimes allergies runs in the family rheumatoid factor is a test done for people who are suspected of rheumatism and arthritis thought RF is also an immune response just like allergic response but they got different roles those are typical allergic reaction especially

make sure If possible avoid TVVideo Games everyday or play by taking break within specific time interval If you play video games everyday continuously then definitely they affects on your eyes health It could be a pinched nerve or God forbid an aneurysm PLEASE see your doctor or go to the emergency room immediately This is NOT something you want to take any chances with You are the best advocate for your health take advantage of that and take care of any problems that come up with your health  and take any preventative measures to make sure you stay healthy See an eye doctor to better know if this is something to worry about If you have high blood pressure or diabetes  dont wait get to the hospital immediately Especially if you have high blood pressure or are a diabetic you should see your endocrinologist eye doctor asap If youre not able to see them right away go to the emergency room to make sure youre ok Please dont take any chances with your health Take care Last week I attended a twoday seminar on plastic surgery at the CedarsSinai Medical Center here in the Beverly Hills area It was excellent We had terrific speakers from various subspecialties including facial plastic surgery general plastic surgery ophthalmic plastic surgery and cosmetic dermatology One of the more interesting subjects was how we surgeons now view the treatment of the aging lower eyelids Because of the stellar performance of filling solutions such as Restylane Juvaderm Perlane Sculptra Radiesse and Artefill we are exploring new roles for these products The sense now is that we can be more conservative about taking out the extra fatty tissue of the lower eyelids One reason is that often the fat bag prominence is partly due to shrinkage of the fat over the cheek bones just below the lower eyelid fat bag So the contrast between the bulging of the fat and the flatness of the adjacent cheek tissue renders the fat more visible and unsatisfactory Consequently many surgeons are evaluating the appearance that follows after merely using filling injections along the lower rim of the orbital bone In other words the hill doesnt look so high when you fill the adjacent valley For many patients that is all they need Some patients will still need a chemical skin peel or laser treatment to help tighten the lower eyelid skins fine lines or wrinkles Others have darkness of the skin which is the most difficult problem and our scientific artillery is not yet good enough consistently for that although there are some new bleach creams that seem promising I enjoy attending these continuing medical education seminars because we collectively are probing and searching  always  for better and safer treatments for patients Such is the history of all medical practice for thousands of years Remember Science Never Sleeps Since the child will be briefly under anesthesia it would seem logical to just probe BOTH nasolacrimal ducts at the same time The procedure is fast and easy and really poses no additional risk to the child A child with nasolacrimal duct obstruction on one side may eventually develop the problem on both sides By probing both sides you could head off a future obstruction  It would be nice to know the CAUSE of the eye pain before addressing ways of dealing with it See an eye specialist first The watery nose and eyes can be improved with an antihistamine either Benadryl or Childrens Claritin or Zyrtec The slight headache can be improved by ibuprofen or acetaminophen Please dont post pictures Besides it would not be possible to definitively make a diagnosis based solely on your story did you have poison ivy contact and a photo of the rash The fact that your eyes are puffy and itchy does point to some sort of contact dermatitis The skin only responds in a few ways the most common being a rash and thousands of things can cause a rash If you do indeed have poison ivy on your man parts and around your eyes you need more than just an accurate diagnosis You may greatly benefit from ORAL prescription corticosteroids I know you are not itching pun intended to see your medical provider but this is the only way to get an accurate diagnosis and a definitive treatment regime A yellow purulent puslike discharge from the eyes is a sign of  This should be a treated with a prescription antibiotic ointment or drops specifically for the eyes Your medical provider will need to give you a prescription if heshe agrees with this tentative diagnosis I always recommend that people use the antibiotic eye drop in both eyes from the beginning since it can definitely spread to the other eye An antibiotic eye drop would ONLY be effective for pink eye caused by a pathogen Many cases of pink eye are viral or even allergic so in this case the antibiotic would not likely help A conjunctivitis pink eye can spread even when you are on antibiotic eye drops No Ibuprofen 800mg is the maximum single dosenever take TWO A cheap quick test for what Unfortunately when you have the array of medical problems that you have listed there are no cheap quick tests for anythingwhether you have insurance or not You need to be under medical care so that you can have your headache evaluated your blood pressure monitored your congestive heart failure managed and vision disorder checked These are not things you can do over the counter so it would be in your best interest to find some affordable care For most healthy people who do not have any underlying medical problems and only need a vision examthe OPTOMETRIST is fine They are highlytrained professionals An OPHTHALMOLOGIST is a physician who is an eye specialistmost do surgery and treat individuals with serious eye disorders She is taller than the average 8 year old girl in the 90th percentile A matching weight in the 90Th percentile would be about 80 pounds Taller girls do look thinner but before we would determine if a child was underweight undernourished etc I would need to review their nutritional state family history etc Puberty  a few years down the road  tends to change weight and height a great deal so in the meantime just have her pediatrician carefully monitor her growth There is no anatomical communication from the ear canal to the corner of the eyes I dont know what you are seeing but what is coming out of the eyes cannot be ear drops or baby oil That would not be likely Yeast likes warm dark moist places like the vagina or inside a diaper The eyes and nose really doesnt have a welcoming environment that would be favorable to yeast You are safe As you know health experts on this site have absolutely no way of looking at your eye across the Internet so you are getting a blind guess A red painful eye could be conjunctivitis pink eye assuming you did not have any traumainjury to the eye Viruses and bacteria are the main culprits and treatment is usually with prescription antibiotic eye drops A small yellow lump on your sclera as you call it may be a harmless pterigium I hope I spelled that correctly Look up this common eye disorder on the Internet or on WebMD to see if you can find a picture Yes it is okay to wear contacts Contacts go on the cornea and a subconjunctival hemorrhage is on the conjunctiva an entirely different area of the eye Noit does not hurt your eyes to sit close This story goes back 50 years or more when television was new and cathoderay tube screens were poorlyshielded and thought to emit harmful radiation At least this is what my mother told me and claimed was the reason for my glasses Television screens are safe but you can see better if you sit back Not yetthat technology is not even close to being perfected Oral antibiotics including cephalexin will NOT clear up pink eye conjunctivitis If the cause is suspected to be bacterial a prescription antibiotic eye ointment or drops are used  Some causes of conjunctivitis would include allergy or viruses and do not require any antibiotics One possibility would be a vitreous floater The eye is filled with a jellylike substance so small specks can form in the visual field Because there can be other possibilities and because your eyesight is important I would encourage you to see a good optometrist or ophthalmologist for a thorough eye examination In the meantime you can read about floaters by doing an Internet search Sperm in the eyes will not cause you to go blind If you are getting sperm in your eyes on a regular basis you need to learn to avoid it Doctors including psychologists are required to report crimes of this natureIf I client tells you that he killed someone dont you think it would be wise not to grant them confidentiality Rape is no different AhhhSandbox Eyes I see this quite often The next step assuming he is still crying rubbing his eyes and complaining is to see a medical provider to see if he has a CORNEAL ABRASION  a painful scratch on the cornea You will need to take him to an Urgent Care facility The medical provider will put a drop or two of an anesthetic solution to numb the eye instant relief A tiny amount of brightyellow fluorecein dye will be put in the eye to reveal any scratch It can be seen using a black light in a darkened examination room If he does have a tiny scratch he will need some antibiotic drops or ointment for a few days while it heals These things are painful but fortunately they heal very fast Pink eye conjunctivitis can be cause be allergy viruses bacteria and chemical irritants Only the bacterial type needs antibiotic eye drops The rest may clear up without the drops Conjunctivitis is never treated with pills unless it is assumed to be allergy in which cases antihistamines may be recommended The eye does not change in size when a person has conjunctivitis pink eye This is just an infection or irritation of a clear coating containing blood vessels that cover the surface of the eye The area the eye the periorbital area can occasionally become swollen and give the appearance of a smaller eye but the eye has not changed in size Pink eye or conjunctivitis should be evaluated by a medical provider and be appropriately treated A medication used on the SKIN should not be used in the eyes There are prescription EYE medications for this purpose Skin preparations often contain MANY ingredients and vehicles that are designed for the SKIN not the eyes Your head wont explode if that is your concern but the increased vascular pressure may not be very comfortable for you If it hurtsdont do it A suggestion Decrease your max weight and increase your repetitions at a lower weight In other words lower the intensity of your workout at least for powerlifting until you feel better You may have sustained a small corneal abrasion from this incident Corneal abrasions heal quickly but are at risk for a secondary infectionand chickens are not known for their high levels of personal hygiene You can see your optometrist and urgent care facility or your primary care provider Most will have the ability to fluoresceinstain your eye check it for an abrasion but always ask first when you make your appointment This visit should be as soon as possible Amoxicillin does not cause pink eye The standard treatment of pink eye conjunctivitis is with a prescription antibiotic drop or ointment You will need to call your medical provider the one that treated your ear infection and ask for a prescription to be called in You should not need to have another medical examination in most cases An ophthalmologist is a physician with the most expertise in this area although many optometrists and primary care clinicians are capable to dealing with this issue Most minor scratches quickly heal but it is recommended to be on an eye drop containing antibiotics to prevent an infection and people have corneal scratches from conjunctivitis pink eye are already using it This would be an impossible question to blindly discuss in this forum since we do not know anything about you your medical history ormore importantly have any way of examining your eyes It is very important that you see an eye care professional or your primary care medical provider so that you can get to the bottom of these blurred vision episodes Ear drops instilled in the ear canal can go through patent open surgical tubes go down the Eustachian tubes to the back of the throat Those drops would then have to travel upwards unless she is lying down at the time and go UP to the nose and travel UP the nasolacrimal duct to get to her high This is really an unlikely journey Is it possible the drops are draining out of her ear canal into her eye or a finger goes into her wet ear and accidentally rubs her eyes a few moments later Yes A sty hordeolum is unrelated to acne and it can be treated surgically while you are on Accutane Going to the hospital ER is really not the best place to evaluate a twoyear old eye injury with residual symptoms andthere is really nothing over the counter that I could recommend over the Internet since I do not know anything about you your medical history age extenttype of injuryetc You need to SEE an eye specialistan ophthalmologist someone who has the training and ability to conduct a highlevel evaluation Before ANY treatment one must first have a definitive diagnosis An accurate diagnosis is not made by symptoms alone Without knowing your medical history and have the ability to examine you firsthand there is really no way that a medical professional could determine what you have I am sorry but you will need to seek proper medical care Many shallow corneal abrasions will quickly heal but they are susceptible to getting infections Most clinicians will use antibiotic eye drops for several days once it is determined that the corneal abrasion paper cut will heal Unfortunately I have no way of determining the seriousness or outcome of your eye injury without a handson examination Yes a viral infection cold can cause a mild viral conjunctivitis pink eye Since I cant really see or examine your child over the Internet you will need to make the decision whether you feel she has eye redness due to a virusor irritation Since she is really not having any other classic symptoms of pink eye like copious drainage or pain it would be prudent to just watch her for nowand make sure she doesnt rub her eyes You are treating a sty correctly Maybe Amoxicillin is excreted slightly through the tears so it may help a mild case but those antibiotic eye drops are better Lie her down and put the drops in the nasal corners of those tightlyclosed eyes Then pull down her lower lid or trick her into opening her eyes and those drops will slide right in Are you sure it is a petechiae in your eye and not a tiny subconjunctival hemorrhage Hard coughing common in uncontrolled asthma can cause an innocent capillary rupturehemorrhage in the conjunctiva but not really true petechiae these occur on surfaces I cannot specifically advise you since I do not have the ability to SEE or EXAMINE your injuries so seeing a medical provider would be prudent  a vague description is not sufficient information to determine the significance of your injuries Although I cannot see your scar first hand as a wound heals it may produce more scarring tissue This can often dissipate in about a year In some cases the scar tissue can become quite prominent forming a keloid If you are concerned about the current appearance of your scar you will need to see a medical provider to examine it firsthand Yes that can happen It happened to me If the prescription or prism assuming you have one in your glasses is incorrect even in one lens this can cause dizziness If the glasses are progressive lens bifocals or trifocals this can also cause visual disturbances that are interpreted by your brain as dizziness There can be hundreds of different causes of dizziness but your first step is to take your glasses back to check your prescription and fitting If everything is perfect then you will need to see your medical provider so other causes of dizziness can be investigated Yesthis could be a contributing factor and yes you should call your doctor I have to say that I have no heard of this disorder Eczema is a dry SKIN condition atopic dermatitis an the eyeball has no skin Your medical provider may be using this term to make an explanation easier to understand but it certainly confuses me See another ophthalmologist for a second opinion or at least get this one to give you the medical name for his condition Is it possible your husband misunderstood the name Sodium chloride drops are salt water I have been seeing kids for over 40 years and I cannot recall one incident where a child fainted from pink eye or even an ear infection As a matter of fact it is pretty rare for a six year old to faint PERIOD so yes I think your little girl deserves a thorough examination to find a reasonI just cant buy the pink eyeear infection theory Sorry Like you I am a bit skeptical I dont know anything about your little girl or have the ability to examine her so I dont really have any wild guesses as to why she fainted or if this was a seizure but I do feel she deserves a workup I would suggest a pediatric neurologist These innocent little red areas are called SUBCONJUNCTIVAL HEMORRHAGES  They are just tiny little bruises from ruptured blood vessels They appear bright red in the eye because the conjunctiva is crystal clear and easy to see If these hemorrhage occurred on your skin they will be just a tiny bruise and go unnoticed Blood vessels can rupture for many reasons but the most common cause of these would be strainingstraining to lift something straining at work or even straining to have a bowel movement I saw a new mother a few days ago and both her eyes were bright red from hemorrhages She had quite a strain delivering a 10 pound baby a few days prior People who take aspirin or other bloodthinning medications tend to have more of these conjunctival hemorrhages If you are bruising in other areas not just your eyes it would be wise to consult your medical provider Common area No but herpes zoster shingles follows a nerve pathway so this painful infection can occur in this area Hopefully your doctor prescribed the appropriate antiherpetic viral medications for you These are quite helpfu Pain medication is also important since this can last a while longer How long It would not be possible to make an accurate prediction since this is really up to your immune system but I would expect that you would be considerably improved in a week if you had the antiviral medication The fever headache and flulike symptoms are typical of shingles so hang in there Sepsis is NOT contagious but the microorganism is capable of being transferred in many ways Exposure does not necessarily mean that you will develop anything since our body is usually quite skilled at fighting off these attacks How in the world are you getting urine splashed in your eye from someone else You need to step back a bit Have a great time As long as you are continuing to use your antibiotic drops you are good to gothere will be no risk to others Yes this would be called VIRAL CONJUNCTIVITIS However when it is only affecting one eye with purulent discharge I would be suspicious of a secondary bacterial component This is just a guess however since I have no way of seeing your eye firsthand Many times it is difficult to tell even during an examination so many medical providers will just treat it with topical ophthalmic antibiotic ointments or drops It may clear up on its ownit may spread to the other eye or to others in your family or work so having a prescription eye medication would nice Many medical offices will simply call it in for you if you ask Yesyou need to see an ophthalmologist for a thorough systemic eye examination See a dentist immediately Call your doctor first Many primary care clinicians do not have the proper equipment like a slit lamp or instruments to remove a corneal metal splinter or even the person skill to do it You may be better off going to an urgent care or occupational health facility that does this all of the time or even a eye doctor Againcall the facility or provider first to make sure they do this Certain ferrous metals can quickly rust and cause a ring making the treatment more complicated so the sooner you do this the better Absolutely NOT Noeye floaters are very common and are not linked to cancer Assuming the cause of your eye infection was bacterial the use of antibiotic drops should limit your contagiousness in about 24 hours  Taking some precautions after this time like handwashing is still recommended It is time to see a subspecialist a otoneurologist  an ENT that specializes in inner ear disorders and have a new workup There are numerous types of vertigo so it would be good to have a new evaluation Things may have changed since you were ten Unfortunately there are not very many things that can be done but there are more treatments and medications out there depending the TYPE of vertigo that you have At my age I am just glad I woke up In my own experience I suspect that my brain awakens before my eyes open but that does not mean everyone on this planet experiences awaking the same way I dont have enough medical information to throw out profound answers but high on my list would be a neurological disorder perhaps a seizure problem Your child should be seen by a pediatric neurologist for a full diagnostic workup I dont knowI would need to know the NAME of the prescription eye medication when it has expired and if the person that is being treated now was accurately diagnosed One source of this information would be to call the pharmacist that filled this prescription I have known patients who have used them for this unusual purpose but I cannot support the medical efficacy of using hemorrhoidal cream for saggy bags under your eyes Use at your own risk Yes transmission is possible There are two reasons for this The most common reason is nasolactrimal duct obstruction  the tear duct drainage system from the eye to the nose is clogged or compromised This tends to spontaneously improve as the child ages and can be surgically fixed if it does not clear or open by age 1218 months Another reason could be a minor eye infection like conjunctivitis If the eyes are not red and the mucous is not pus then the most likely cause is the nasolactrimal duct obstruction Your baby will see his pediatrician at age four months so assuming this is not an infection it can wait until then No prescription antibiotic eye drops will not cause a change in blood pressure Many things can elevate the blood pressure however so if your readings are higher you will need to see your medical provider A change in BP meds or and adjustment in dosage is sometimes necessary I am not familiar with your other two medications  Nevanac or Durezol  so it would be best to check with the medical provider who prescribed them or your pharmacist Most topical eye medications are not going to cause systemic effects such as raising your blood pressure Floaters just happen whether you drink wine or not I have never heard of direct medical association with floaters and wine As a childcare provider you should be used to saliva snot and all types of bodily discharges Seasoned childcare providers develop such great immune systems from these exposures that they could work in the slums of Calcutta and not get sick However if you are new to the kidbiz then you will be getting sick from time to time usually colds Our bodies have remarkable resilience so you will not likely have any problems from the goobery finger but if you do get an eye infection you will need to call your medical provider The tears have ability to wash away a lot of those initial germs so I suspect you will be fine Staring at anything for long periods of time can cause eye fatigue but not necessarily eye damage I remember my own parents in the mid1950s telling me that if I sat too close to the television that it would damage my eyes and I would need glasses of course I did end up with glasses but not from the television I dont believe there are going to be any adverse health hazards including vision damage from 3D gaming but as a parent I would advise you to limit the amount of time that kids spend in front of the computer screen Set the parameters up front and stick to it Children need to spend time playing outside playing with friends playing sports reading and using their active imaginations Video games sort of take that away And finally carefully monitor the TYPE of games the children are playing Play with them in order to see what you have just bought Games filled with violence killing highspeed car crashes raises their adrenalin levels and causes stress They also do not set good or real examples of the world outside As much as I would like to help you I cannot SEE or EXAMINE your eye over the Internet to provide you with a patientspecific answer You will need to see a medical professional or eye specialist so that you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated You cant diagnose an illness based on vague symptoms alone but your symptoms are troubling Brownish or yellow eyes could mean jaundice hepatitis or other liver problems Throwing up blood can be a very serious sign It would be in your best interest to see a medical provider as soon as possible Those are not typical symptoms of a visual acuity problem so it would be wise to see a good eye doctor for a careful examination It would not be possible to even guess at the reasons for your array of symptoms without a handson evaluation I cant see your eye but this may be a common subconjunctival hemorrhage  This can be caused by coughing sneezing exercising or even straining for a bowel movement Having uncontrolled high blood pressure and certain medications can be other factors but in most cases this condition is innocent  looks worse than it actually is If you are concerned you can see your medical provider or even eye care professional for a exam and consultation I cant answer that question since I would need to know what it actually was I cannot make a blind guess and determine if it will go away I am very sorry There are MANY things that cause intrascotal masses A brief description of the size and location does not really substitute for a thorough examination I realize that money may be tight and that you do not have insurance but there are really no alternatives You will need to make a decision based on how concerned you are about this new finding Give your husband the same consideration as your automobile If your car was causing problems or making a strange noise you would get it checked out before it became worse I am not sure what type of doctor you are seeing but you need to be carefully examined by a ophthalmologist  an MD that specializes in eye disorders Yes You may have a corneal abrasion No I cannot help you regain your sight but by seeing a ophthalmologist at a large universitybased medical center you may be able to benefit from having a highlevel evaluation If there were any way to restore your sight based on this exam I am sure they would discuss it with you Oops I missed the lid part If the dog did not actually scratch your eyeball then a corneal abrasion is less likely If the dog only scratched your skin clean it very throughly and apply a topical antibiotic ointment or cream If it appears to be getting infected in spite of these home treatment efforts then you can see your medical provider Styes hordeolum are not contagious or infectious like conjunctivitis pink eye They are really just inflamed oilglands Yes these things can be very nastylooking but they do not pose any risk to customers As long as the cook maintains a highlevel of personal hygiene hand washing not trying to touchsqueeze these painful lesions he is capable of working If the cook is in fullview of customers as he is preparing their meals it could result in a few doubletakes from people who may not understand the nature of styes I work closely with children and babies every day If I had a big stye I would probably just stay home apply some hot compresses and wait for it to resolve I pose no risk to the babies but I would get tired of explaining my eye to parents Yes These are compatible medications Talk to your parents and have them take you to see a medical provider right away It would be impossible to adequately evaluate a person with a headache blindly over the Interent let alone determine if they had a brain tumor You should see an eye doctor so that you can have your eyes especially your cornea properly examined Hot grease can cause injury to the eye itself as well as the thin skin surrounding your eye Puss maybe a signs of infection andor inflammation Cut me Mick Rocky I Yes in some cases a fresh hematoma accumulation of blood can be surgicallydrained if done promptly but someone with the proper skill since this can lead to an infection however in most cases the old blood will just reabsorb over time and you can make up a great story about the black eye I strongly feel that the medical provider who makes a comment has the responsibility to fully explain what they meant There is really no way for a third party to do this Age 44 is not old enough to have significant agerelated eye issues unless he was commenting on the possibility of future cataracts Call him up and make him explain what he said See an ophthalmologist eye physician for a second opinion A droopy eyelid may be ptosis a problem with the nerve leading to this eye lid There can be other reason Eating honey or putting honey directly in your eye not sure how you intend to do it but that would be yucky will have absolutely no effect on your eye color The color of your eyes is geneticallydetermined It would be best to have your babys pediatrician properly prescribe for her due to her very young age The list of allergy medicines that can be used is often just lowdose Benadryl Allergies and colds can mimic each other in their array of symptoms at this age Neither If you have herpes in your EYE you need to be seen by an ophthalmologist  Yes shingles can definitely affect the eye This is called herpetic keratitis and can be quite serious if not diagnosed promptly and treated effectively Steroid eye drops can make herpes in the eye worse so this is usually not done unless specifically prescribed by an ophthalmologist Antibiotic eye drops would have no beneficial effect on herpes involving the eye so special antiviralantiherpetic drops are used Having chicken pox as a child is really a prerequisite to getting shingles in the eye or other places The chicken pox virus is also a herpes virus that has reactivated from a second exposure I am pleased that her eye cultures came back negative This may be a neurological problem that can affect men or women This could be a condition called Bells Palsy but there can be other causes Please see your medical provider so that you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated Yes Staph can grow in or around the eye and yes it is possible that contaminated examination equipment could somehow contribute to an infection ClaritinZyrtecand Allegra are longacting nonsedating antihistamines They are all compatible with Singulair Assuming you do not have any underlying medical problems that contributed to the subconjunctival hemorrhage these are usually innocentand it is safe to fly on an airplane That lowgrade fever is nothing to be alarmed about Since some types of pink eye conjunctivitis is related to viruses like cold viruses there could be an association since viruses can cause minor temperature elevations If the eye is unusually swollen or painful then it would be wise to get properly examined but in most cases simple pink eye should not really cause a fever If this is a fiction novel you can write anything you want A thermal situation capable of exploding the eyes would fry and kill the person long before that happened I cant really answer this very patientspecific question since I do not know anything about you or your medical history nor do I have the ability to examine you It would not be prudent to blindly guess at a reason or reasons so my suggest would be for you to see a medical provider when this occurs You are selfdiagnosed and selftreated You have lost weight and are not improving so the answer is YES You need to see a medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated Go to a different officesee another optometrist or ophthalmologist And take those glasses with you You need to see a medical professional for a thorough examination There are many different types of headaches While migraines tend to be onesided getting a proper diagnosis with the TYPE of headache you have is very important when it comes to determining an effective treatment Because you are having visual issues your medical provider or neurologist may also want you to see a eye specialist These eye drops do not contain any amoxicillin so it is okay to use Incidentally these sulfabased eye drops tend to burnsting so be nice to him I dont have any information on the CAUSE of your daughters vision loss so only her ophthalmologist could answer this question There are prescription medications for this condition usually a mild steroid Even the over the counter 1 hydrocortisone cream can help Many clinicians also recommend using mild soap to wash this area like Johnsons Baby Shampoo This will not even burn your eyes That would not be very likely The tiny amount of those eyedrops may contain lidoCAINE but this has nothing to do with COcaine Besides you should not be using these eye drops anyway unless specifically prescribed by an eye care professional Little eye boogers are just finethis is just thickened tears Many babies have narrow nasolacrimal ducts  the tiny drainage ducts from the corner of the eyes to the nose If the tears cant drain down the ducts for whatever reason they will accumulate in the mornings or after naps Most not all tear drainage ducts will open up fully after about a year old If the conjunctiva is red or irriated then a mild infection could also do this Before talking about a cure one must first have a diagnosis  a causereason for the eye redness and burning For instance allergies one of the causes would be treated differently than if the cause was a bacterial conjunctivitis pink eye Maybe All branches of that facial nerve may not be affected Dont selfdiagnose this disorder See a medical provider right away since prompt treatment can really improve the outcome of Bells palsy or other facial nerve disorders Notypically they will do an eyewash firstthen use an eye ointment and probably have you wear an eye patch and hope that it comes out on its ownThats what they did for me I went through this with my own son We decided to take him off of Concerta  pills for adHd Tried the Feingold diet  saw great improvement But you have to be a stickler to the healthier nutritional plan Its tough but we put all the kids on it Diet isnt magic but it made us feel like it was APPRECIATE GOD TO SEE THE BEAUTY OF DIFFERENCES OF SHADES AMONG US  TO RESPECT DIFFERENCES IN REACHING THE ONE GOD IN DIFFERENT WAYS  NOT TO HATE OTHER FAITHS  NATIONS LIKE HOW EVERYTHING IN THE NATURE IS IN HARMONY WITH EACH KIND OF SPECIES yes You need work if you eye get better on it own If not you need make dotor trip I would go to the Dr ASAP especially if these syptoms have been prolonged there are many things that can cause these symptoms but only a Good Dr can diagnose I strongly recommend returning to both the eye doctor and a dermatologist While it isnt common blindness can be caused if the shingles virus infects the eye If the blisters are anywhere near his eye this can be a concern It is also possible that the antiviral they have him on simply isnt effective for him I was prescribed two different antivirals to treat my shingles outbreak last fall because the first wasnt giving the results we wanted probably due to an incompatibility with my own body chemistrythats what the dermatologist told me You should get tested for Lyme Disease immediately There is not always a bullseye rash or visible tick You have nearly every symptom based on those experienced with having it Lyme Disease and other tick related coinfections are referred to as the great imitator because it brings on so many symptoms simultaneously that are consistent with so many other conditions They may want to test you for other things as well because of this especially as this has only been going on for a few days Personally I would specifically ask for an ELISA test and Western Blot to confirm  I am not a doctor just had lyme a few times If it is Lyme the sooner you are put on a protocol the better chance you have of not getting chronic Lyme Good Luck Hope you feel better soon cyst sty I think cats can cry Mine likes to whine when he cant go outside I dont know what brand youre using but retinol can be irritating and drying to the skin Some people need something milder After its absorbed I then use a face lotion for sensitive skin Also it may have nothing to do with the retinal just coincidence There are eye products to reduce the swelling Hope this helps Are you under unusual stress As I child I did the sleep walking for awhile and I was under a lot of stress It didnt last into adulthood but many adults do suffer with it Medications can cause hallucinations which Im sure you know and so can emotional problems I went thru some terrible hallucinations at night in my teens and early 20s I dont know your beliefs and all I can do is share my personal experiences and answers but I believe I had opened a doorway into the spiritual realm by playing around with some demonic things When I became a Christian they persisted until I learned to demand they leave me alone in Jesus Name Only happened once after that and I again used His authority and havent had hallucinations since But it only works if you are one of His Thats been over 40 yrs Id suggest you also go in for sleep study testing Hope something Ive said helps Apparently Dr Oz just did a piece about The Triangle of Deaththat area from between your eyes to just below the corners of your mouth Most people will have their hands in and around there doing something either consciously or subconsciously at least once a day Pulling nose hair and popping zits on the nose and near the lips can easily lead to infection including infections that can spread to the brain Im not suggesting you did any of those things but swelling is a common sign of infection  \t \t \t \t \t \t\tpage  margin 2cm  \t\tP  marginbottom

simple ear infection If they are loose you can wiggle them until they come out But the best answer is to take her to your dentist for an evaluation If the adult eye teeth are not erupting properly the dentist may recommend treatment that could help to avoid problems later in life Hum If the pain is also coupled by light sensitivity and redness  as crazy as this may sound  it may be related to that inflammation from an IBS condition If you arent an IBS sufferer then another possibility is a scratched cornea The first thing you should do with any substance that gets in your eye is flush it out with a proper eyewash station or bottle If liquid gas splashed into your eye then response is required quickly if it is only fumes irritating your eye then just walking out of the area for your eyes to recover should be enough Dry skin associated with hypothyroidism requires more hydration and added moisture than normal or oily skin If your skin is itchy consider using calamine lotion or overthecounter cortisone cream Implement hydrating solutions that contain natural oils such as avocado or almond oil which will hydrate the skin without causing an allergic reaction A lot depends on how extensive the eye bags are If the underlying causes are medical or from lack of sleep these issues should be addressed first Next consider discussing the use of fillers with your dermatologist Properly placed fillers along the lower eyelid and cheek junction can mask the presence of eye bags Hyperpigmentation discoloration or postinflammatory hyperpigmentation PIH on your skin can be attributed to a variety of disorders I like to begin with excluding any medical reasons that may result in hyperpigmentation Hyperpigmentation may be attributed to renal disease diabetes or peripheral vascular disease PIH arises from an acquired excess of pigment related to an inflammatory process such as infection an allergic reaction a reaction to medication or a trauma PIH often occurs as a consequence of inflammatory skin disorders including acne druginduced eruptions and eczema Once you have excluded medical causes there are multiple options to regain your even skin tone A combination of glycolic acid AHA and tretinoinbased products  along with a traditional topical skin care regimen  will work for skin brightening Hydroquinonebased products work well However there are other alternatives such as bearberry kojic acid licorice extract and niacin These compounds will work towards brightening your skin and correcting your skin tone The key is to work with a physician that is very familiar with your skin type and color because incorrect use of these agents can lead to further hypo or hyperpigmentation I tell my AfricanAmerican patients in particular that in order to get your skin in shape it has to be a gradual process similar to exercising You would not attempt to lift 250 lbs on the first day of your workout this attempt may lead to injuring yourself and disastrous results The same holds true with your skin regimen a gradual approach is always best Once you get your melanocytes in shape and under control you can improve your skin tone You will need to find out the cause of your undereye bags You would discuss them with a surgeon if the bags are due to excess skin or excess fatty deposits Each of these conditions may require surgical removal to achieve the best result If you suffer from a flattened midface negative vector your concerns may be addressed with nonsurgical fillers to help achieve better balance in your face The cost for eye fillers differ from region to region across the US Typical fees may range from 250 to 700 per syringe Your final decision for skin rejuvenation should not be based solely on costs You may want to contact the physician in your area and ask about their fees and payment options Insurance does not typically cover cosmetic facial enhancement procedures Other alternatives include simply getting enough rest placing a cool compress on your eyes with caffeine and reducing the level of your stress Eyes are typically the first place that my patients complain of wrinkles The muscles around the eyes contract frequently and secondarily wrinkle the skin covering it Make sure that youre not overlooking simple solutions to stop contracting your eye muscle such as getting the proper prescription on your eyeglasses or contacts Are you squinting Are you smoking and frequently squinting as a result In addition to decreasing excessive muscle contraction you should add vitamins A C and E to your eye moisturizer and apply it twice a day Good job with the sunglasses and sunscreen Find a cute hat too Whiteheads occur when your pores accumulate excess oil or sebum and fail to drain Frequently acneforming bacteria will arise simultaneously due to pore blockage and the alteration of the pH on the surface of your skin In order to combat this you will need to begin exfoliating your skin and reduce surface bacteria on your skin with compounds containing alphahydroxy acids AHAs or salicylic acid The treatment for dark circles begins with prevention Getting adequate rest will improve your circulation and lessen the appearance of dark circles In addition look for topical agents that contain natural brighteners such as bearberry niacin or licorice extract Topical caffeine and green tea also help constrict leaky vessels which helps minimize the appearance of dark circles Your best way to fight premature wrinkling is sun protection Sun damage and smoking account for the majority of premature aging In order to help combat wrinkling use compounds that exfoliate dead skin cells glycolic and AHAs encourage new collagen deposition tretinoinbased products and provide nutrition for skin cells vitamins C and E and peptides Most women want to look younger At age 34 you are young and too young for wrinkles of the type you describe The red shaggy description suggests there may be other skin concerns that you should consider You owe yourself a trip to the dermatologist Let them evaluate you and make sure you have not developed an allergic reaction an infection atopic dermatitis or any other kind of skin condition After you address any underlying skin issues youll probably look healthier and younger Use sunscreen and a moisturizer that contains vitamins C E and A Also be sure to exfoliate in order to maintain a more youthful appearance Eye bags are a problem for many people The easiest nonsurgical option is to make sure you are fully treating any allergies you have Proper use of antihistamines vasoconstrictors and light compression on the eyes at night can make a big improvement also Lasers are sometimes used to decrease wrinkles but this would not really decrease the bags Some dermatologist and plastic surgeons are skilled at using fillers to fill in the groove that outlines your eye bags This is a great nonsurgical answer for many men and women Make sure the doctor is skilled and understands your skin type There are deposits around the eyes that can be associated with high cholesterol If that is indeed the case its most important to address your cholesterol Heart disease is serious After you correct your cholesterol you can have the lesions removed without them returning A purple color under your eyes may be attributed to the tiny blood vessels within your lower eyelid The skin in this area is quite thin and stretched over the bony prominence which will make these blood vessels more noticeable Sun damage is the No 1 cause for premature aging of the skin If you have to work outdoors try to avoid the sun between the peak hours 11 am and 2 pm UVA and UVB penetration are strongest during the early afternoon Use a sunblock with an SPF of at least 40 And wear a wide brim hat while outdoors drink plenty of fluid to keep your skin and body wellhydrated Your first approach is to ensure that you are receiving an adequate amount of rest Apply cool compress around your eyes in the morning with green tea bags Avoid excess alcohol consumption and very salty foods You also need to weed out any underlying medical issues such as sinusitis allergies or a reaction to contact lenses At age 16 I would avoid many of the harsh chemicals that are available It may be wise to have an evaluation by your doctor to determine if there are any underlying medical issues Next implement simple measures such as getting at least 810 hours of sleep every night Dont leave the weekends to catchup on your rest Apply cool a compress with green tea bags around your eyes This will help with puffiness Any time you have an eye infection it is a good idea to replace things like mascara that cannot be disinfected Mascara should be replaced every six months at any rate Your eyeliner can be disinfected by sharpening well past the point you used when you were undergoing the infection Most other eye makeup can be disinfected check your pharmacy section to see what they have available Under no circumstances should you share this kind of makeup  You may have impacted ear wax like my fiance You may need to go to your doctor and have your ears flushed out They will remove all of the built up wax and clean out any residue that may be left Im no Doctor but his father has had to do this multiple times but he never has any problems with it Hope this helps Hi sorry to hear about your pain For longterm aid you could try decreasing your meal sizes as the day progresses especially at dinner You could also try eating 34 hours before going to bed to allow your food to digest better chewing your food properly to aid with digestion and eating less processed foods For temporary relief you could try taking over the counter medicines like Gaviscon or Dica or antacids or chewing gum Hope this helps perhaps pressure may be on her nerves The thing that came to my mind right away was Optic Neuritis as I had this condition last year in both eyes If your eyes hurt when your moving them go and see your local eye Dr and they will be able to confirm this by having a look at the back of your eye and it will be obvious if it is Optic Neuritis Then the next step is to see a Neuro eye Doctor who may treat the infection with IV steroids to help bring the inflammation down quicker and hopefully your eyesight can be saved But remember I am not saying you have this  it is just a suggestion and you will have to see a real Dr to rule this out I have had the same problem for approx 2 months Eye exam came back clear I did find out i am far sighted and was prescribed reading glasses My eye pains are accompanied by headaches mainly to the left side of my head i only sleep on my left side so maybe the weight of my head affects the relevant nerves to my temple and eye I was worried about optic neuritis because it is often a classic symptom of multiple sclerosis and quite a few people tend to go on and develop MS within 10 yrs of having their first bout of ON  classic symptoms of ON loss of vision colour perception changes inflamed back of eye upon eye examination  last week i had a head brain and spinal MRI all of which came back clear So eye nerves not involved I was so worked up about possibility of MS But as soon as it was all clear most of my symptoms went away Eye pain has greatly diminished too Based on GPs advice although he cant say definitively what is causing this pain it could be dehydration are you drinking enough water lower your caffeinealcohol intake as they are diuretics stress i am going through an incredibly stressful period so am accepting it could very well be a psychosomatic symptom migraine andor ice pick headaches cause the stabbing eye pains sinuses have you tried sinus tabletssprays to see if that helps eye strain so very common esp if you work on a computer for many hours at a time Eye pain could also be a sign of arthritis esp rheumatoid arthritis  do you have any other aches and pains Have a full blood count and ask to check your antibodies to rhuematoid arthritis and lupus Its probably something benign causing the pains But they are irritating i know For me ive put it down to dehydration eye strain currently studying and stress  i find when i chill out and relax my symptoms diminish if not completely disappear Hopefully your symptoms have imporved since your post Hi and welcome to

suffers from Keratoconus An Ophthalmologist suggested that she undergo Collagen Cross Linking C3R or CCL It is a method to strengthen ones cornea using UV light and some Vitamin However when we took a second opinion we were told that it can be done for corneas that are thicker than 400 microns That made my wife an unsuitable candidate for the procedure I suggest that you have your eyes checked thoroughly before you undergo the procedure dont go for contacts lence go to doc and asked for lazik after examine ur eye  that is a strong warning sign of an upcomeing stroke watch out for dizziness nausa  severe headaches those are major red flags to go along with the symptoms my mother in law had the same issue at only age 50 she had a severe head ache for about two days and then the rest of the symptons hit her within minutes of each other but she kept a nose bleed and busted eye vessals constatly they told her at the hospital that that should have been her red flag every time that happened it made more clot build up in her brain steam which was what eventually lead up to her stroke im not saying that is the case here but it is a possibility SYMPTONS OF A STROKE dizziness constantly tired unexplained drop in bp vomiting head ache sensativity to light my mother in law had a blood clot in the brain steam she described it as having a explosive mirgrain when she was awake but all she did was sleep for hours and hours at time she would wake up long enough to do the nesscities and back to bed she would go do this for about 2 3 days before but some ppl can do that for up to a month before they actally have one ekg and blood work wont show any of these its neurological but wont show up on a ct because it shows the brain not the brain steam which was where everything else came in every sympton you mentionted plus nose bleeds and busted eye vessals but not every body does that fact a lot of ppl do not I would say no Hair loss may occur during the first few months of treatment This effect is usually temporary as your body adjusts to this medication If this effect persists or worsens tell your doctor or pharmacist promptly Remember that your doctor has prescribed this medication because he or she has judged that the benefit to you is greater than the risk of side effects Many people using this medication do not have serious side effects Tell your doctor immediately if any of these unlikely but serious effects of high thyroid hormone levels occur increased sweating sensitivity to heat mentalmood changes such as nervousness mood swings tiredness diarrhea shaking tremor headache shortness of breath Get medical help right away if any of these rare but serious effects of high thyroid hormone levels occur chest pain fastpoundingirregular heartbeat swelling handsanklesfeet seizures A very serious allergic reaction to this drug is rare However get medical help right away if you notice any symptoms of a serious allergic reaction including rash itchingswelling especially of the facetonguethroat severe dizziness trouble breathing it may be arcus senilis Arcus senilis or arcus senilis corneae is a white gray or blue opaque ring in the corneal margin peripheral corneal opacity or white ring in front of the periphery of the iris It is present at birth but then fades however it is quite commonly present in the elderly It can also appear earlier in life as a result of hypercholesterolemia Arcus senilis can be confused with the limbus sign which reflects calcium rather than lipid deposits You most likely have pinkeye I had the same symptoms You should go to a doctor and get it checked out as soon as possible the hache with the light and stuff sounds like a migraine but the swollen lip either could be a bite an absess or their allergic to something they ate so back track and try to remember exactly what they ate they sound like it may be an allergy Are you diabetic by any chance I found this tool on WebMD where you just select a condition and it shows you what you would see if you had it I found this condition that showed spots if this one doesnt seem right just choose another condition from the list Ive had the same pain that you described  I went to my optician over this discomfort  Id recently been diagnosed with Temporal Arteritis and was very concerned  My Dr felt that my pain was caused by Trigeminal neuralgia He said I should be fine and that sometimes middleaged and elderly people sometimes get this condition With Temporal Arteritis theres a danger of going blind so I felt relieved by this diagnosis I recently underwent Collagen Cross Linking using a new technique My corneal thickness is less than 400 microns This new method allows thinner corneas to be operated upon too Search for a hospital or an eye doctor that uses the newer technique Good Luck I really would like to know if something can be done about the constant burning in my eyes due to bleach being put in them about a year and a half ago The small yellowish lump is what is probably whats causing your eye to be red and hurt What I found when I searched your answer was floppy eye syndrom but Im not sure if thats what it is I will still mention it to the doc when I go soon There doesnt seem to be much irritation under the eyelid though my eye lashes on the more tired side do flare down more like the symptoms of floppy eye Theres no abnormal discharge My instinct is that it could be Myasthenia Gravis but my PCP didnt seemed very concerned Im really frustrated because I know people see that one side of my face looks exuasted while the otherside looks like its in shock Nothing really stood out from the blood tests done at the PCP so I wasnt told to do anything else about it Should I take it upon myself to set up an appt with a Neurologist I dont want to keep forking out money to be told things seem normal I dont want to wait for symptoms to get worse and Ive waited to this point to see if things would get better Are their any other eye problems that are similar to MG and floppy eye Are there better test to request from the eye doc or pcp You can always try shaving itmy five year old has a similar problem and I shave her eyebrows whenever its needed If it doesnt seem to bother her and it doesnt move it probably isnt a big problem but you should probably see a vet soon the sooner the better just in case Im no expert but I wouldnt be surprised if it was just a placebo and he started blinking thought he had a problem with it and then continued to blink more and more because his brain thought he had a problem so the brain made it so he did have a problem It shouldnt be too big of an issue so I wouldnt be worried sometimes its because he doesnt understandbut my son had a 65 hearing loss and was reading lipsdoes he stair at people when they talk my son did and still does it freaks people outbut get him to ear doc it is exactly what it looks like a freckle or small mole they are mostly harmless i know this as my optician noticed i have many small ones at the back of the eye dont worry as these are very common I would keep calling if it is important Neurologist prescribed me Frovatriptan which works on the migraine but not on the frequency which can be every day for over 10 days Sodium Valporate worked like a charm for a few months but then didnt I have just started taking the highest dose 600mg am and 600mg pm and keeping my fingers crossed Have also cut out the top 10 migraine triggers and occasionally testing for allergies by eating one of them for one day then back to diet for another 2 but its hard as you dont want to give yourself a migraine and I still get them anyway There has been an operation done in the John Radcliff to implant electrodes in one ladys brain which seemed to work but I was told by my consultant lovely man  not it costs 15k and my chances of having it were zero Have asked my doctor to refer me to a dietition but he thinks they are no longer available due to cut backs Ive lost 11lb in the last 6 weeks and now just hoping the menopause will cure me as it seems to with so many sufferers Might try cutting out gluten as well but then I cant have my porridge for breakfast Not sure about the phone answer  only had them for 4 months Someone else told me recently they suffered from terrible migraines then he said they lasted for all of  10 minutes Mine last 10 hours Plus Dont loose heart We still have good days unlike many other poor souls who have permanent afflictions like Parkinsons and Cancer Only YOUR body can cause an allergic reaction Your body is reacting to something it views as a threat or invader A bite cant cause an allergy but it can cause your body to have a reaction The prior bite is probably unrelated to your symptoms Especially since it happened 3 months ago and youre still having issues Keep in mind that you can develop an allergy at any point Example Perhaps you drink Orange Juice every day3 times a day You can even develope an allergy in the same day Imagine drinking the first and second glass of OJ and be just fine Then you could drink the third glass and have a reaction Because of your eye symptoms it makes me think its more likely youre allergic to something in the air Im sure youve heard of hayfever However latex allergies can be very dangerous Lets say you have a SEVERE reaction and need to go to the Emergency Room Guess what The Drs and nurses will be touching you with latex gloves which would make it worse You need to be tested to find out your allergen What it is thats causing your bodys reaction You can have your doctor test you or even use one of the home allergy tests they have on the market now One possible cause for sudden bright white light in your vision could be the retina in your eye could be coming unattached you MUST see an opthalmologist and get it looked at if it continues persistantly This is not a good thing but it can be fixed if you act quickly CONSTANT eye drainage should always be checked If you have possibly damaged your cornea it could be leaking out slowly It is very important to have it checked by your eye doctor In some cases it is just allergies to something in the air It can also be a problem with the tear ducts But if it contiues with no let up DO see a doctor Vertigo maybe mine is usually caused by wax pressing on my ear drum except the 1st time which was from a middle ear infection As well as the other answer note that you may have an allergen to something in the new house If you are allergic to certain pets and the carpets had not been properly cleaned from the prior occupants this could cause the issue Also considering you made no mention of this other then at night it is possible that you sleep with your eyes open or partly open which may cause them to dry out If this house is lees humid than your previous then this is a perfectly logical cause If ou notice that the house is dry feel free to use a humidifier Not sure but i think its left eyejust guessing  Dont use it by yourself consult with the doctor or expert physician first Because there are many types of brand some are allergicsome are having used only chemicals and some are organicso probably now i think you understand a bit why im suggesting you to go to doctorAfter all its matter of our skin dear  your lifestyle maybe the reason i mean the diet planshort sleepingeating lees veggies and all that kind of stuff Possibly a condition called Bells Palsy Sounds like some irritant Especially being in the area that you are in I would flush my eyes out before going to bed at night and keep using moisturizing drops during the day Also upon waking would wash the lids by splashing water on them and then towel dry This would take away any irritant that settled on the lid while you were sleeping Change all bed clothes before starting this and keep washing them frequently to keep the airborne irritants off your sleeping space I am not an MD However my stepdads father had an incident in which he scratched his eye with a piece of welding slag It leaked for several weeks and eventually dried out causing him to have it removed If the problem is highly persistent or your eye leaks any fluid I would suggest having it looked at sooner rather than later 1merrybee is correct Blurred vision was recently added to the list of side effects for Lyrica It started to affect my vision slightly about 6 months after I started on it Luckily it barely affects me so Im OK with it However if it isnt working with you you may want to ask if Cymbalta another drug approved for the treatment of FMS doesnt have similar side effects I would think it would be from allergies due to the ventilation If you havent already I would try taking some kind of allergyantihistamine medicine and maybe give it a couple days to actually work properly and see if it makes a difference I am by no means a doctor but thats my suggestion Hope I help Headaches have been proven to be comorbid w Epilepsy Seizures A Convulsion IS a Seizure As to wheter it is related to Spina Bifida  Shunt all I can say is Lots of People with Epilepsy have more than one disorder that may or may not contribute to seizure activity You should seek the Opinion of an Epileptolgist if Your Neuro has no answers well video games do cause eye fatigue but as long as he has no history of SEIZURES he should be fine just make sure he takes 515min breaks when his eyes start feeling tired when playing You may have strained your ocular muscles I fell down the stairs in November and strained all my muscles Didnt know why my eyes hurt until February Dont wait get checked out I had this prob in the past and it was a stye i alternated hot and cold and it brought the head out then it drained and went away after a couple of days you probably have an astigmatiziam which is weak eye muscles Have you used a magnifying glass I had the feeling that a stye was there somewhere but couldnt see it Went to my eye dr office  asked if one of the nurses could examine it Nurse found an eyelash on pupil This happened to me a few years ago I was so scared that I was at the eye doctors office when it opened  They worked me in and dr gave some fancy name for it and said nothing to worry about It never happened again It was worth the trip just to be reassured  About 10 years ago that happened to me and scared me to death As soon as office opened I called my eye dr office and the receptionist told me to come in that day Nothing serious other than experiencing many floaters through out the day for several days but doc said it could have been indicative of a serious problem Your age might have something to do with problem along with any existing eye conditions I have to admit that I did get some strange looks when I started swatting my hand in front of my face at what I thought were nates it was just the floaters See your doc soon  its really a relief to get the docs opinion Good luck Does it itch May be a contagious  but not serious condition called pink eye  im sorry to say you should get to MD eye specialist so they can give you presreciption drops to avoid infection from abrasionin the mean time get some lubrication eye drops this is a serious problem dont mess around with your sight BEST WISHES personal reference I HAD A CORNEAL ULCER THE MOST PAIN ID EVER FELT ALMOST LOST SIGHT ENDED UP AT THE PROCTOR EYE CENTER UCSF I GOT GREAT CARE I WISH I WOULD OF WENT FOR HELP SOONER yes you should see a doctor put a few drops of milk in each eye may sound crazy but it works  I have been welding for ten years have burnt my eyes several times have gone to doctor but found that this works  put drops of milk in before sleep should feel relief in morning you may have problems w the spine or head and neck area i have the same problem somewhat your going to want to se a dr to make sure but here is what i do for headaches and vision A Stye is an infection of a gland of an eyelid Usually this happens because the gland has been blocked The stye will almost look like a pimple and can point inwards towards the eye or outwards It can be sore and painful A good treatment for most styes are warm compresses This means taking a warm towel and pressing it on the eyelid with your eyes closed for 15 minutes at a time Do this four times a day Also stop wearing makeup since this can make the infection worse Most styes resolve within a few weeks Sometimes antibiotic eyedrops are given by doctors Also if the stye is not getting better within a few weeks an eye doctor may drain it If you are having additional redness around the eye are having fever or are concerned its best to speak to your doctor and have him evaluate it I am an adult with add and I was always sick to my stomach taking Ritalin I lost 17 pounds and felt agitated most of the time I stopped using Ritalin and started taking a product that my neighbors daughter was having good success with So I started taking the flavay got my weight back and no more nausea Sometimes I have gas but I dont think its related I think I snack too much anyway thats what my wife says I like putting a drop or two of colloidal silver its a natural antibiotic My neighbors into natural stuff and shes pretty informed on this sort of thing I use it for my eyes when I forget to take contacts out at night The next morning my eye feels scratchie  A drop of colloidal silver in my eye and its gone I buy it at whole foods Lets put it this way i was told to check bp at home when my daughter checks it the old way it is normal  but when i check it on my machine both top and bottom numbers are up by 20  and i have had drs say they are not accurate so check up on it is all i can say hope it helps you How old is he I ask because due to certain genes a wide range of heights are common at certain ages even among siblings I am not a doctor but I have contacts for far away and I asked my eye doctor one time if getting contacts would make my eyes worse and he said that its actually possible that since Im only 20 that they could go the opposite direction He said that a lot of people who are need lenses for far away around their forties experience a shift in the other direction and end up needing glasses for close up things So depending on your age that could be the case Also Ive also read that prescription changes with both eyes become more nearsighted can be related to undiagnosed diabetes But with the retinal detachment im not sure how this would apply Not to freak you out but it might be something to see your regular doctor about too if you dont think it could be a natural change its true Ive heard this also well your going to get pinkeye again real soon  you probably walk around school like that kid who blows snot boogers and doesnt know what deodorant is good luck through high school because chicks love dudes who get pinkeye every other week That is pretty odd to have occurred as many times in one year as it has I had pink eye once in my life and never since It might have to do with washing necessary materials where your eye comes close or in contact with when you have pinkeye I know I caught strep throat at college 3 times in one semester because I forgot to change my toothbrush once and didnt wash my sheets the second time so maybe close approximation to objects has been keeping the bacteria in close proximity to certain living spaces you reside often Xbox controllers and so on should be wiped down with Clorox antibacterial wipes to disinfect any bacteria Hope this helps Have you been tested for Hepatitis or a liver disease It could possibly be a sinus infection I have similar problems but not quite as extreme What I found to help is periodically pull on them outward and those lashes that are loose and ready to fall out will pull out gently thus not falling into your eyes Hopes this helps it doesnt solvebut it may help Thyroid disease is one cause of eye pressure Can be very serious Seek medical opinion asap Allergies or sinusitis Something I couldnt put I was sleeping a normal 7 hours and that was making me depressed during the day which is probably the BPD But I practically HAVE to sleep 12 hours to be able to function even a little bit And even with 12 hours the eye thing is STILL happening Maybe not so bad

and whyto solve in any situation in our problemfirst in what and why in a problemsecond how and when and where to solve the problem Is it actually on the eye surface or on the skin outside the eye If it is the first you need to get it checked out I had a corneal ulceration a couple of years ago on my pupil I found it early and did not have pain or blurred vision but was cautioned not to wear contacts for a long time It does require immediate medical attention If it is on the skin eyelids surrounding the eye it may be a sty or cyst You could try hot compressessoak a washcloth in hot water and apply three times several times a day The eye pain indicates you at least need to contact your doctor Hope you feel better Possible Pink eye You need to get him in to his Dr This is very contagious i think i have the same thing swollen bottom lipcold sores jeadaches and my eyes hurt and fever for two days that will come and go they told me it was herpes but i dont believe it Um that

touches a cold sore or touches infected fluidsuch as from sharing eating utensils or razors kissing an infected person or touching that persons saliva A parent who has a cold sore often spreads the infection to his or her child in this way Cold sores can also be spread to other areas of the body Cold sores start to heal on their own within few days If pain is experienced it is better to use skin creams ointments or sometimes pills it heals faster and it stops uncomfortale symptoms You have conjunctivitis it starts like that then it becomes too worse your eye starts to produce alot of discharge and it becomes very red To treat it you will need to use hyaline and tobramyacin I recommend a visit to an ophthalmologist to prescribe medications for you I am on 50 mg and it seems to help alittlemaybe you arent on a high enough doseage Keep yourself busy during the day have a relaxing bath after a healthy dinner and avoid too much thinking This way you will surely have a better sleep at night It also helps a lot to meditate Leave all the stress behind and take a good rest Maybe its the stress that brings all those skin and health problems all this time You have to make sure that you are getting enough sleep Intake of alcohol may also cause dark circles so you have to stay away from drinking too much alcohol Begin a healthy life and maintain it go to ER anaphylaxis can require in depth treatment specialist to solve the problem and education on prevention try different hospital someone needs to do something different think about what u have done different recently when it started and its something u r still exposing urself to soap detergent new food or something u have used before that u have now developed an allergy to make a list and stop one at a time and u will figure out what it is Your husband should be tested for sleep apnea right away He is probably sleep deprived and his heart health is at risk Does he snore and like snort and wake himself up Thats because he has stopped breathing There are many reasons for sleep apnea Also if he has a cold or sinus congestion or cluster headaches that can cause these symptoms But I am thinking he has sleep apnea After I found out that I have sleep apnea and started treatment on my cpap machine it took about a week to get used to having the mask on but within 3 weeks I noticed that I was thinking more clearly and had way more energy Call an Ear Nose Throat Doctor and they will get you started Could be an ulcer in the making Got to the eye doctor you should take her to the hospitalShe may have something like bark or dirt in there and it can clog the tear duct So you should get it checked out before it does any major damage seems something is differentcontact his dr  To add to the original question I have difficulty to focus when reading to the point I must look away If I look down the pain is sharp One or more of your tear ducts may be blocked Call your Ophthalmologist right away before it turns into an infection This is usually a side effect after a nose or tear duct surgery Have you had either of these Most likely You should get referral to ENT Ear Nose and Throat Specialist I also have swelling in my hands and feet Id advice to repeatedly wash off your eyes with cold tap water Then switch off lights and be in dark for a minute Then turn on light to see if you have sensitivity to light If you experience sensitivity to light then it is advisable to visit a doctor Hope it helps Yes it can It can cause blurry visiondry eyes and sore eye balls I would take himher now that way they can look at her and get a better understanding of what is going on  Have you changed anything Detergent softeners new clothes wout washing first new bed just about anything including a once not allergic to a food allergy is he on antibiotics My now 10 then 8 went through this he broke out every day for 3 days once covered half of his body however benadryl made it go away so it saved me trips to the ER i did take pictures and give them to my sons pediatrician  It was around Halloween time and it stopped as fast as it started The closest I came to figuring it out was it was either the detergent so i switchedor his 2 costumes  try to think of anything thats different new activity with new surroundings anything Also hives can be caused by stress this too has happened as well to my son 12 is middle school and a hard age Good luck to you Could be your marbles are out of whack they are right behind your ears Try standing in one spot stare stare at something in front of you Now shake your head back n foth hope this helps It did me You have to take meds for at least 5 days before they are in your system for you to see any change I have dry eyes and also on pain meds My ophthalmologist started me on over the counter eye drops called Systane It lubricates the eyes and works great I buy it at Costco its cheaper than the drugstore I dont think its health related it may be more spiritual related seek a spiritual counselor you may have a spiritual gift you have not tapped into yet Good luck and God Bless i cant give you a sure answer but i can say its possible only for the idea that when u workout your blood flow increases and with that the blood in your eyes do  as for why u would have bloodshot eyes it unclear do u have high blood pressure by any chance  or or u talking anything to enhance ur workouts  cause that can be a cause possibley if it doeant stop i would say go to your doctor  my brother had blood shot eyes all the time and its not form anything green P but allergies if your workingout outside maybe ur near something bothering you  either way maybe even a quick call to the doctor cant hurt he will let u know if its something to worry about  hope this helped what it ripped off  like gone get him to the er  you eye needs to be able to have constant mositure if left untreated he can go blind  if he dont want to go knock him out n take him  noone is above the laws of biology  the doctor will surely create something that will have him be able to keep his eye moist weither is surgey or drops he will have to out in all the tme he could really have a big problem  i hope this helped Hi Sorry I couldnt find the reply section and hence i am seemingly replying to my own question when I am noti am new to webmd I want to thank Beachbaby012 for her insights I admit I am facing some social insecurities and am mindful that I must seek help for the same However I still do believe that I have some problem if not accomodative isotropia that cause my eyes to turn exceedingly inwards Perhaps its a partial squint of some sortI am no eye expert I have had a few eye exams in the past the last one being about 7 years back yes i knowit has been that long I understand that the right course of action for me would be to visit the eye doc and will do so right away Can I still have someone check out my photos here to see if I am not just being paranoid Is there a way to post photos here for others to assess If the temperature does goes over 102F you should contact a physician at least to ask for their opinion Vomiting can be a cause of a bacterial infection ear infection or tonsillitis where she needs antibiotics Last time my daughter had a tonsillitis she also had vomiting and the temperature got over 101F We gave her some suppository with Ibuprofen to lower the temperature and went to the doctor next day Ibuprofen is also an antiinflammatory that will help with any possible infection she has Hope your daughter gets well soon If she also does vomit after drinking a bit of water do only give her plain still water No sparkling water and or with sugar or other sweeteners you can give her some iced chips like pieces of crushed ice That will prevent the mouth from getting too dry and she might feels a bit better To lower high temperature you can also do cold leg compresses How is your skin Any yellow tint If so go to the doctor right away You may have jaundice which means something is affecting your liver functions The thing about pepper spray is that it is relatively safe but can be debilitating for a time which it is why it is used Rinsing you eyes with water may help afterwards The affects of it will last several minutes and then gradually taper off The signs youve described can also be caused by hypo or hyper glycemia Have a doctor do some simple blood tests to make sure he doesnt have diabetes Sounds like an allergic reation to me as well Most allergic reactions can be treated with meds such as zyrtec allergra claritin or benydral Id start with one of those Just follow the directions on the box However if your throat starts to close or you have difficulty breathing get to an ER right away Hi You are not alone Believe me There are others dealing with the same issues I had migraines for about a month I could not eat because then Id throw up could not be in the light could not even go outside Each and everytime that I went outside Id throw up The light bothered me and made my migraines worse as well as the noise and the TV There are good meds out there on the market for that You just have to experience with them to see which one helps you to the most I too saw my neurologist for my migraines he gave me a script but it did not help very much Those migraines are a killer Id cry because I could not eat or keep anything down It did started with an aura And mind you I was outside waiting on the metro rail stop when this happened I sort of had a feeling like kind of oooze So I called my DR and he told me to get to the nearesr ER And they told me it was migraines And I was just constantly throwing up left and right at the ER have you tried to swaddle her My kids always woke themselves up by twitching in their sleep and hitting themselves We got a swaddle blanket and it worked wonders You could use a regular receiving blanket Open the blanket up and lay flat fold in half diagonally so you have a large triangle put baby so her shoulders are slightly above the longest side this should be the center of the blanket tuck the point of the triangle into her feet wrap the right side in all the way over her and under if you have that much slack making sure that her arm is inside the blanket then do the same to the other side making sure again that her arm is under the blanket It keeps them from swatting themselves and may keep them sleeping longer Good luck Talk to your pharmacist who will probably tell you to talk to your doctor 0 no Commonly the stated symptoms are found in sinus infection Some people do also feel an increased sensitivity or headache when they lean forward because of the additional pressure placed on the sinuses Some may also experience tooth or ear pain fatigue or bad breath As Elizabeth suggested there is no link between ear wax and sinuses I think a health care provider would be a real solution of the issues you are suffering from You can also get a guide from your family doctor as he would be well aware of your health care history and suggest you with process ahead It sounds like it could be a partialonset seizure You should keep a log of these with the date time activity when it started duration time of your cycle and what your last meal or snack was for each time it happens Then take this log to your doctor and tell them what happened including the fainting httpwwwepilepsycomlearntypesseizuressimplepartialseizures I have eczema on my arms but for some reason one of my eye lids gets extremely dry so I have to put cream on it I put Eucerin cream on my eczema and eye lid It seems to be safe to put near eyes because it is free of dyes and scent though Im not an expert so I could be wrong It hasnt completely cleared up my eczema but it is helping to keep it from getting worse and not itch so much So for right now Im going to continue using it and see if I can get it to clear up but if not Im going to see a doctor Cant speak directly to a pilonidal cyst close to the tailbone but in my experience working in urgent cares and assisting in minor surgeries like that these cysts are lanced drained and packed with some string cant remember the name but left to heal from the inside out with the postop care including pulling the packing string out slowly It continues to drain pus butheals from the inside out Eventually you pull all the packing out keep it clean and after a few weeks its healed Im guessing this iswas a sebatious gland cyst Sounds like it healed over and reoccurred Golf ball size sounds like it didnt heal from the inside out Needs drained again surgically Eye problems and sex drive arent directly related probably It would put me in a bad mood too  Ouch httppmahoneybuythistodayinfo httppmahoneybuythistodayinfo It could possibly an allergen Best to talk to you MD If any vision changes go to MD or ER right away yes i would go 2 the er eyes are not something 2 play with No it is not you could pass the virus on to other people sounds like sciatic nerve damage following restless leg syndrome i have it and its horrible i am a nurse and have fibromyalgia and its caused me to have all sorts of issues see the doctor for meds and therapy my husband and our dog have diabetes and it depends on how bad diabetes is weight and control of diabetes and all If ur not getting consistent reading the dogs diabetes in not controlled it will be high and then low and in between its a nightmare thank god i was a nurse til i got sick myself but its alot to handle get dog to vet r call them perhaps it has to do with the changes with blood pressure etc Im not sure if this is any help but have you been consistently putting something on it like facial wash that might irritate it Ive done that before and just had to make sure that I didnt continue to do that and it got better I too battled migraines for 4 months After several different meds that did not work I came to the realization that the one thing that had changed in my life prior too was my cell phone I quit using my smart phone and the migraines went away I thought it was that particular model so when it came time for my free upgrade I then got another smart phone only to have the same issue It turns out that I am sensitive to what ever the method that data is sent and received in modern day smart phones I have a dumb phone with the mobile internet that does no effect me at all I still have the original smart phone that gave me the worst migraines and I use it to get on wifi and it does not effect me at all Hope this helps Due to heavy work many of them are not going to their bed at the right time but are waking at earlier hours This effects very badly on our health conditions and may be lead to many health problems So it is better to sleep somewhat earlier and do practice some exercise as your body can feel tired and you may get good sleep This can rid of the problem from dark circles and you also had an option of some natural products usage for the problem you are suffering Because of natural products you can get relief and gain more confidence What is sloppy eye syndrome what causes bloodshot eyes when i workout i get bloodshot eyes when i cry when im angry i also take warfrin but i been getting this before i started taking warfrin i have high blood pressure too which im taking meds for  About 2010 I got a concussion when I fell while I was a patient in the hospital strangely enough I did not at that time have vestibular issues But I do now Its very frustrating when youre doing the PT for vestibular and still have the symptoms  I passed out without any warning Stood up and 30 seconds later passed out again Both times I landed on my face But I was unconscience before I even hit the floor Doctors were thinking it likely was seizures The last time I had a seizure was approx 1985 But I have been taking my medicine to prevent them for many years Could it be possible that switching to a newer drug Antivert may be to blame I dont know why my neurologist made me switch After all if it aint broke dont fix it According to him Dilantin is a very old medicine I have gone back to taking Dilantin But I am getting therapy for vestibular as a result of the episodes BTW is there a difference between dizzy and lightheaded If the question is Do I go to the ER the answer is yes When it is bad enough to cause asking that question go Its better to go and find nothing is wrong than to not go when it is needed Eye exam I would get eyes checked Sounds like near sighted in left eye Well that is a dangerous question to ask as you may not like the answers you will get although these issues may be caused by possible dehydration the drink more water part I think it was a brush off on the ERs part It is possible to be something far worse but I am not an MD in any way shape or form but to me it sounds a lot like MS I would have your family doctor look in to it and set up a appointment with a specialist Im not a doctor but I have had three kids and the best way to protect yourself from a cold is to keep your hands away from your facewash your hands especially if you have been out in public anywhere like the grocery storeSometimes you cant help it someone around you will sneeze producing droplets that get in the airI also try to eat oranges and drink plenty of orange juice headaches generating at forehead and left temple area with some facial numbenss on left side of face I worked at an eye doctors officeYou need to see an eye doctor and stop using over the counter stuff We see this alot and most of the time its dry eye or an eye infection Your eyes are importantreally see an eye doctor get your blood tested may be the iron level is low or B12 you need to get to bed earlier  try working out in the am and then maybe your body will be tired at night "}
