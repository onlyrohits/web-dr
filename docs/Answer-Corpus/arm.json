start understanding you will automatically start doing HW as well as feel interested in classes If the mark looked like a target it possibly could have been a tick and in that case you would want to get treatment for lyme disease I think I know exactly what you are talking about Even if I bend stoop climb stairs too much I tend to get red dots blood splatter in my legs I have autoimmune issues but basically healthy and wondered if that causes these events The pooling of blood goes away after two to three days unless it breaks out really bad then it takes a little longer before it clears Sometimes it makes my legs throb but no real serious pain is associated with the breakouts Again any pressure of stress put on my legs causes this With sensations such as numbness or tingling suggest a nerve issue and you should consult your primary doctor to see if a visit to a neurologist is necessary To feel like you are dying at age 18 is very concerning You should definitely consult your family physician and possibly see a specialist Persistent symptoms after Lyme disease has been treated appropriately with antibiotics is a very controversial area We do know that longterm antibiotics do not help and are associated with serious complications We also know from recent studies that Lyme disease does not relapse but you can get reinfected The most common symptom of Lyme disease is a classical rash erythema migrans and patients who get this rash again have another infection not a relapse A small percentage of patients who are treated for Lyme disease 1020 develop persistent symptoms which may last for 6 months or more This syndrome is called Posttreatment Lyme Disease Syndrome PTLDS According to the most recent advice from the Centers for Disease Control CDC there are many fraudulent products claiming to treat chronic Lyme disease So be cautious and make sure you are not being treated by quacks Treatment by a physician associated with a University teaching hospital would be a good choice In addition to seeing your physician and making sure there is no other condition responsible for your symptoms the CDC recommends that you eat a healthy diet and get plenty of rest talk to a counselor and keep a diary of your activities and symptoms I have had symptoms of poison ivy rash which was initially on undersides of arms and on front of shins Now over most of my body After two 5 day treatments of 12 steroids a day and steroid cream it is worse than ever during steroid treatments it started to fade but came back with a vengence when the pills stopped Depending on how bad the burn is you may want to buy Silvadene over the counter It is used for burns  Sounds like it could be a yeast infection There are now creams available over the counter to treat that One possibility In my 20s I had chest pains My doctor asked me about my caffeine intake I drank at least one Pepsi a day at the time plus some tea I cut out the Pepsi and the symptoms went away

neuropathy of the brain so to speak but other factors such as build up of plaque in the veins that is the issue and when the plaque builds up it narrows the arteries Check this website out though for more information The best of luck to you and GOD BLESS I would show a respectful and calm concern over my ER visit and its resultant findings Three 3 medical conditions were uncovered as follows ERs can be wonderful in stabilizing patients and coming up with a preliminary diagnosis But unless life threatening situations cannot be resolved most patients are sent back home to followup with their medical professional My suggestion is to see your primary care doctor and report the ER findings Your doctor may want to run more testing prescribe medications or refer you to see a cardiologist Periodically well hear on the news of a basketball player who collapses dead while running down the court Just like you they were supposed to be in excellent physical condition Dont let that happen to you make an appointment to see your doctor sooner rather than later Your grandma more than likely has Post Polio Syndrome PPS Some polio survivors after many decades have a return of polio symptoms as you describe in your question It is suspected that damage was done to some muscles during the original polio epsiode and that the remaining useful muscles after decades of overwork have now become weakened and unstableThe diagnosis of PPS can be difficult to make and no cure is presently available Physicans specializing in PPS and neurologist treat its symptoms mainly with physical and occupational therapy Some medications have had limited success in helping to reduce fatigue and pain in PPS patients It is suggested that the characteristics of upper extremities bleeding easily with delayed healing should be assessed by a medical professional This condition in the elderly has the strange name of  Senile Purpura Some of the reasons for bleeding easily may be attributable to delays in the blood coagulating andor platelet help blood to clot disorders Other conditions such as liver disease hemophilia and the taking of medications such as aspirinwarfarin blood thinner type agents can also be responsible for your easy bruising and excessive time to heal The following WebMD link will open a link for an article that discusses the reasons behind bleeding and clotting disorders that cause bruising httpwwwwebmdcomskinproblemsandtreatmentsbleedingorclottingdisordersthatcausebruising It is recommended that you make an appointment with your family doctor to have a complete medical exam routine lab works and the updating of your medical history I hope that this answer has been helpful My answer is meant to be constructive and not intended as a judgmental criticism by labeling your condition as being caused by alcohol abuse You could be experiencing a condition called alcoholic neuropathy  The symptoms as you describe them may be signs of nerve damage which can be permanent If you stop drinking your pain and the tenderness feelings may diminish due to an improved nutritional balance within the body Besides terminating your alcohol intake through approved treatment methods Detox Rehabilitation Talk Therapy Medications 12 Step AA Program Involvementetc  taking B vitamins such a B12 and Thiamin and seeing a neurologist are advisable steps to be taken You can stop drinking alcohol and prevent other serious medical problems This is best accomplished by being vigorously honest with yourself and seeking addiction help I wish you well Sutures usually remain in place for 710 days so its time for their removal It is always best to have stiches surgical sutures removed by a medical professional Besides removing the sutures that person can assess the wound and how it healed But I realize that that is always not practical It is actually a relative safe and easy process to accomplish by yourself or with the assistance of a friend or family member Here are the steps Check that healing of the sutured area appears to be complete While not entirely necessary I suggest purchasing a suture removal kit from the pharmacy or medical supply store They are compact disposal and relatively inexpensive Wash your hands for a few minutes with soap and warm water Clean the area with an antiseptic lotion Begin by lifting in a gentle manner any one of the sutures close to the skin with tweezers Do not stretch the skin While holding the knot cut the suture with the other hand and gently pull it out by the knot Repeat the process in no particular order until all sutures are removed Clean the area again with an antiseptic lotion I am a proponent of triple antibiotic cream which may be found in some dollar stores Place a clean bandage over the area I came from a large family of 6 children where being stitchedup was a common occurrence Mom removing the sutures in an uneventful manner was also a common occurrence If you notice any redness swelling or excessive pain then do not hesitate seek emergency attention The nurse employed some useful techniques in her quest to obtain your blood sample It sounds like she was technically knowledgeable Here are some details from your story that support my assessment Sometimes taking blood from the top of the hand or wrist works well Using a small  butterfly collection kit designed for collecting blood from babies and young children sometimes helps in the vein location process Being well hydrated clearly helps in the process of having blood successfully drawn Here are my thoughts and suggestions to improve upon your next blood draw experience  I just saw this question Even though its been six days since being posted I felt that your inquiry required a response And perhaps other visitors to this site may also have the same question Yes a person taking Warfarin who sustains a hard fall should be medically evaluated in a hospital emergency room setting Falls can cause serious internal bleeding issues for a person being treated with Warfarin Additionally the possibility of other injuries to soft tissue and bones should be evaluated in an 88 year old person who has fallen I recommend that if even if this individual had a uneventful recovery that the physician who prescribes the Warfarin be made aware of the falling incident Perhaps that prescriber may want to reconsider whether the individual is a continued good risk for taking this drug Older patients are at a greater risk for falling and having resultant head injuries They are also usually more apt to experience drug interactions and experience the medicines known side effects Warfarin can be a God sent gift for Atrial Fibrillation patients but those benefits may more than be offset by the potential side effects experienced by the elderly Based on research studies it is suggested that patients should consider not taking Warfarin longterm  if they have poor balance with a tendency to fall a history of a bleeding disorder dementia Alzheimers disease or an age  75  Special consideration must be applied to individuals greater than 80 years of age People after the age of 80 may have a 50 chance of having hardening of the arteries in the brain This hardening of the brains arteries can cause spontaneous vessel ruptures or ruptures into the brain caused even with minimal trauma 1 in 3 of these individuals may experience life threatening bleeding into the brain Another consideration in prescribing Warfarin to the elderly must include the remaining life expectancy for the individual For example the remaining projected life expectancy of an 85 year old individual is 6 years Therefore the risks of Warfarin therapy for the elderly should be weighed against the potential rewards before

response to reaching for a dropped itemThe good news is that it sounds like you did not compromise the surgical repair I would still suggest notifying your surgeon of the mishap Stiffness inflammation poor range of motion frozen shoulder syndrome pain and tingling caused by possible nerve damage could be suggestive symptoms of reinjuring of the same tendon I had the surgery on December 17 2013 and have reached the strengthening stage of my rehabilitation program My recovery has been somewhat uneventful I am good to my shoulder and it is responding well to the gentle love shown to it Im glad that I had the shoulder repaired I admire you for seeking out a conclusive way of determining whether back injury may be caused by an auto accident Of course forceful trauma resulting from a car accident may cause back injury Equally obvious is that the Insurance company doctors will deny that herniated disc can be caused by a car accident The truth of the matter is that it is virtually impossible to prove that a car accident either caused or did not cause a back injury The entire process must start by having a candid discussion with the alleged victim Is your victims story credible Does it agree with statements included in accident reports and by their treating physicians Did they have previous back problems which never completely resolved themselves Confirm to the client that the insurance carrier will vigorously uncover all back related conditions that were experienced prior to the accident A preexisting issue with the back that was never fully resolved will certainly impact the outcome of a whiplash claim No prior complaint of back pain may strengthen the clients case but proves little Most people  50 years of age suffer from some arthritis and degenerative disc changes and not have any overt symptoms Next thing that Id pick through with a magnifying glass is the treating physicians report and scan reports Does the medical professional have the facts straight as reported to you by the client Your success will hinge on being as educated as possible concerning back problems picking away at incorrect statements and assessing truthful vs untruthful answers  I havent seen any studies absolutely confirming a link between essential tremors and shingles But there are plenty of web type anecdotal accountings of their common development in some individuals for me to see a connection It was interesting to see that the drug Pregablin  As described in an article on BioPorfolio was approved by FDA to treat nerve pain as sometimes seen with essential tremor conditions It was also approved to treat nerve pain associated with diabetes and shingles Gabapentin Neurontin based upon my personal experience is an effective medication to treat neuropathy It is also used to treat seizures restless leg syndrome and other neurological conditions Hopefully Gabpentin will be titrated for you to an effective dosage level where your neuralgia will be under control Gabapentin comes in capsules and pills up to 800 mg During clinical trials Gabapentin showed effectiveness with daily level between 1800 mg and 3600 mg Your prescribed dosage will be individualized according to height weight sex age and your medical condition  This sensation of feeling an object s crawling on your body may have a medical basis It is known as a Tactile touch Hallucination Do not allow the term hallucination to lead you to believe that you are becoming mentally ill The other 4 senses smell sight taste and hearing may also produce their own hallucination and each has its own name For example an individual may smell an offensive odor in the absence of any environmental stimuli Olfactory Hallucination Sometimes these hallucinations are caused by brain abnormalities in the form of tumors Yes and sometimes people have emotional conditions that may cause these symptoms Below as follows are some previously answered questions by me on WebMd that may be helpful

discuss the symptoms with your family doctor who can interview you complete diagnostic testing and refer you to other specialists Additional details since I ran out of room Ive done so much research and havent found an answer as to what they could possibly be be caused from or if theres any way to get rid of them I dont think theyre cherry angiomas and dont seem to be petechiae which is the closest thing resembling what I have it just doesnt look the same My normal doc didnt even have an answer said since the spots fade when pressed theres nothing to worry about That doesnt make me any less self conscious though or tell me how to get rid of them if its possible This is another photo that shows it as its worst

was pinch nerve in neck  As you are telling that you are having skin colored bumps on your arms thighs and legs then it seems like the symptoms or signs of Eczema It is also called as atopic dermatitis It is a treatable disease with oral medicines In this patient usually get itchy dry and red skin For your any dental problem plz click here  confidentdentalcare  For your any dental problem

confidentdentalcare I was just diagnosed with the exact same thing same place too I was told to make an appointment with a neurosurgeon IMMEDIATELY I suggest you do the same I would say yes but simply because the muscles arent used to being used You should check with your doctor first but Id suggest slowlyvery slowlydoing simple exercises to work the muscles Start with just a very few minutes or repetitions at a time and work your way up Itll probably take several months or longer to get it back to normal But before you do anything check with your doctor Hell more than likely give you an exercise regimen to build your shoulder muscles back up Or it could be caused by something completely different and the exercise could do more damage than good So be sure and check with him first I dont know for sure but I believe our bodies fight to restore itself I was once told to give it 2 weeks or more depending on the severity Dont over exert yourself let your body heal My 7year old boy has the same issue Did your neurologist find anything Whomever gave the shot most likely gave the shot in the fat of the arm instead of the muscle It could honestly be anything There is a high chance it is painful anxiety there could be inflammation or even something to do with your posture I used to continually get pains in my arm and occasional backache once I sorted out my posture and weight I was slightly over weight and fixed my bra size everything eased It sounds like youre looking to lose weight Keep in mind that you cant spot reduce meaning that you cant choose where you lose weight by targeting a certain body part but its possible that strength training may help provide a more toned appearance If youre interested in beginning a strength training routine Id recommend visiting the following website if you need stepbystep guidance with certain exercises httpwwwacefitnessorgacefitfitnessprogramsexerciselibrarylistaspxbodypart2 Gluten is a protein found in wheat and grain products People on a glutenfree diet often avoid wheat rye and barley though there is also debate on whether to avoid oats as well A glutenfree diet allows for fresh fruits vegetables meatpoultryfish and many dairy products Unprocessed beans and nuts are also acceptable as well as products made with rice corn and soy If not buying fresh food its important to always read food labels to look for foods specifically labeled as glutenfree For example foods like cereal bread and lunch meat may or may not contain gluten so the only way to know for sure is to check the packaging The food industry can use gluten in many products that dont seem like they would contain gluten so its important to always read the label first Having a family history of food allergies could mean that your granddaughter may have a genetic predisposition to having food allergies as well It may be beneficial for her to try an elimination diet to identify any food allergies sensitivities or intolerances that she may have The basic premise of this eating plan is to initially restrict eating to very basic foods and then to gradually reincorporate more foods The person doing this can then better discern which foods trigger a negative response when added back into their diet Review this WebMD article for more information on elimination diets and also consult with a doctor or registered dietitian before implementing drastic dietary changes dont know dont know  Actually sometimes complete ruptures only cause pain in the immediate post injury period The best example I can give is people with significant tendinosis of the long head of the bicep tendon This tendon goes from intraarticular to extraarticular and then down the arm in front When inflamed it can be quite painful causing chronic anterior shoulder pain For some this tendon eventually ruptures they have a shot of severe pain swelling and bruising and then their chronic shoulder pain is gone Their bicep muscle looks different but the pain is better Do not use only pain as your guide Weakness or other functional deficits can also be a sign of a complete rupture with or without severe pain An MRI will definitely identify the extent of the muscle injury and it is a noninvasive test that gives you a lot of information looked into getting MRI or seeing an Orthopedic specialist for a pinched Nerve or cervical Neck problems Had a Neck n 2 shoulder repairs I have been in pain just like yours since last Shoulder surgery n told possible SSN Super Scapular Nerve problems i my daughter who is now 6 had what sounds to be the same thing your daughter is going through took 4 different doctors to find out what it was what she had was called foot hand and mouth its a infection young kids can get  look inside your daughters mouth and see if you spot the same blisters on the top back of her mouth I have a friend who had bruises all over her and she never went to the doctor She passed out at home one day went into a coma and never came out til she died She had undiagnosed Leukemia GO TO THE DOCTOR  I have an appointment with a dermatologist on the 29th My General Physician didnt know after examining me just said not cancer not impetigo It sounds like you may have hurt your rotator cuff I popped mine lifting bags that were too heavy for me I couldnt lift my bent elbow above my shoulder or straighten out my arm above my head It hurt down the back of my arm in the triceps area to the elbow and biceps Unable to move my arm backward Had to see the doctor By the way it doesnt go away just stays the same or gets worse I know this because I waited over a year thinking the pain would subside This is typically a problem called Keratosis Pilaris This is a genetic problem that we see in people It can just happen Sometimes you grow into it sometimes you grow out of it But also I tend to see it in people who have either personal or family histories of asthma or allergies Its not something that we can cure but we can help control it Using products like urea or lactic acid or exfoliants this can help smooth the skin and make it softer So scratching and picking at it obviously will make it worse and will make it more red will make it likely to last longer Scrubs can help to some effect Retinoids have not been very effective for this but using products that are called keratolytics something that will help the skin cells turn over more effectively can help it dramatically For some people its worse in the summer for some its worse in the winter You can sort of pick your season If you are out in the summer and you have a short sleeve dress its more important to try to treat it then and in the winter you can let it go if it doesnt bother you But its not a harmful condition its more of a nuisance You dont make new hair follicle so you wont have more hair growing back However as the hair grows back in the tip has a different shape so it feels coarser As that hair grows in over time the ends become a little bit more tapered down and softer so it will go back to normal the way it was before you shaved It can be darker Because over time as that hair fades as it settles on your skin and things rub against it or even as sunlight hits it it can fade and become lighter So it may appear darker but not darker than it would have been  than your natural hair color So it wont be darker than it would have been at baseline It could be from sun exposure fragrance or any underlying even subtle irritation that causes inflammation of the skin can leave behind discoloration also known as hyperpigmentation There is also a type of yeast infection called tinea versicolor that can leave your neck back and upper arms looking blotchy Your dermatologist will be able to help clarify and offer you the proper treatment to clear the condition With a stroke we usually look for slurredgarbled speech onesided weakness or weakness in general but especially onesided confusion trouble walking numbness in the facearmleg again especially on one side confusiontrouble understanding people trouble seeing difficulty walking dizziness or a sudden severe headache As you may know Desonide is a topical steroid It may appear to help the infection but it actually suppresses the bodys ability to fight the infection and will make it worse Even lowstrength topical steroids can make a yeast infection or any infection worse In fact topical steroid use can make yeast infections more likely If you were seen by a doctor after the fall and they cared for the injury its probably just painful because its broken Sorry Im sorry your wife is dealing with  Its not a fun problem to have thats for sure You may have seen advertisements or information about various diets that purport to help cure or prevent skin conditions such as eczema or psoriasis Unfortunately no causal dietary link to these skin conditions has been proven That means its unlikely your wife can improve her outbreaks by changing what she eats Its possible you have read about the  which is under investigation by several researchers Some evidence shows that infants with eczema go on to develop food allergies However this does not mean that food allergies cause eczema The links between foods and skin conditions are still being investigated Your wife may seek medical treatment for her eczema Topical prescription creams often help clear up outbreaks Home remedies for eczema include taking cool showers instead of hot ones and applying moisturizer generously There may be some link between stress and eczema outbreaks so encourage your wife to indulge in activities that help her relax  such as getting a massage Wishing you well I think youve hit the nail on the head Usually when someone describes pain or sensation as electrical we think its nerverelated The same is true for pain described as stinging shocking or burning If the sensation occurs all the way from the shoulder to the fingertips then its possible youre experiencing a spinal nerve compression at the neck If the sensation is more from the elbow on down or something then you may be experiencing irritation or compression of a nerve where it goes through a joint like the elbow You can find out for sure whats going on by making an appointment with your primary care provider He or she can evaluate the situation and send you for tests or refer you to a specialist Hope this helps Thats a very interesting question I certainly think this warrants an investigation My initial reaction is that a pin in the bone shouldnt cause any problems no matter how long it stays in But my second reaction was that I dont know and you may not either exactly what type of pin was inserted Was it a screw into the bone A rod running the length of the bone We know for example that screws used to repair hip fractures can cause pain years later either from irritation to the surrounding tissues or due to arthritis Its not impossible the same could be true with your arm So Id suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider He or she can do an initial evaluation and if necessary refer you to a specialist Hope you feel better soon You definitely need to see a doctor about this as soon as possible If you are a woman this could be something benign like  but it also could be symptoms of heart attack Many people are familiar with the classic signs of an acute heart attack crushing or squeezing chest pain that may radiate down the left arm shortness of breath etc But heart attacks also can last only a few moments such as what youre describing You dont want to take any chances with this especially if you have other risk factors for a heart attack such as obesity high cholesterol a sedentary lifestyle and so on Please take care and get checked out as soon as possible It means you should go see your primary care doctor to find out whats going on here Since youve been off the amitriptyline for three weeks the medication should be totally out of your system That means your symptoms must be due to something else You need a physical examination and possibly some lab work to figure this out Its not surprising the vaginal pain returned after you stopped the amitriptyline since vulvodynia is a chronic condition Hopefully youll find something else that works to treat it without side effects Wishing you well Im sorry to hear youre going through this It sounds very unpleasant First just to clarify an IUD is an intrauterine device Its an implant that goes inside the uterus I think what you meant to say is you had birth control implants rods removed from your upper arm You dont say when you had this procedure done but its not unexpected you would experience bruising possibly considerable bruising since the inside of the upper arm is a very tender area and pain for the same reason You also would experience swelling which is a normal response to having a minor procedure like the rod removal Its also not abnormal for the stitches to ooze for the first 24 hours after you have the birth control rods taken out Your health care provider should have given you some instructions about what to do regarding the stitches sutures Generally speaking you should be able to Gently cleanse the stitches using lukewarm water and plain soap pat dry Apply an antibacterial ointment such as triple antibiotic ointment or Neosporin to the sutures as long as youre not allergic to any of the ingredients in the ointment Many people fear any wound will become infected so they monitor closely for what they believe is pus coming from the wound Usually any fluid you see oozing from a wound is not pus but is simply part of the natural healing process It takes several days for an infection to develop so if you just had the birth control rods removed today it would be virtually impossible for you to be experiencing symptoms of an infection where the rods were removed If it has been more than three days since you had the rods removed and youre experiencing symptoms the next step is to take your temperature using a thermometer  If you have a fever over 101F then you may indeed have an infection You should seek medical treatment In general you can elevate your arm apply ice packs and take an overthecounter pain reliever to help ease the situation At any rate if youre concerned about whats going on you should contact the health care provider who removed the birth control rods He or she is in the best position to advise you how to proceed Wishing you well Im sorry to hear youre going through this It is indeed very painful In plain English a superior labral tear is a torn tendon at the top of your shoulder joint where the head of your arm bone meets the socket of your shoulder It is not an uncommon problem Eventually the tendon probably will heal on its own Tendons and ligaments tend to heal VERY slowly because they have poor blood supplies The bad news is it literally can take months for these tears to heal In the meantime you want to make sure you dont lose range of motion in your shoulder You should consult your doctor for specific advice on whether or not you should be doing rangeofmotion exercises or not If possible avoid moving your shoulder in a way that causes pain Basically that movement is aggravating the tear which will make it heal more slowly Ice wont help because the soothing comfort of cold cant reach deeply enough into the shoulder joint If youre not allergic to ibuprofen you can take that for pain Again sorry youre going through this Wishing you well Assuming you had this mole removed recently Id say the redness and itching are a normal part of the healing process As the body heals a wound in this case the one caused by having the mole burned off it employs several types of cells and chemical compounds to repair the skin layers that have been damaged During that process a chemical compound called histamine can be released Histamine can cause itching Along similar lines the redness can be caused by various cells and the bodys chemical response to the wound Its important you not scratch this patch of skin while its healing If you pull the scab off a scar can form Its OK to rub the area with the flat of your hand If youre concerned about scratching during your sleep put socks on your hands I know it sounds wacky but it will keep you from accidentally scratching your face with a fingernail while you sleep The itching and redness should calm down as the days pass If the redness and itching get worse you can put a call in to your doctors office and speak with the nurse to find out what to do Good luck Im sorry youre experiencing this You need to get it checked out right away If the antacids arent reducing the pain then it may not be caused by heartburn Angina is caused by a reduction in oxygen delivery to the heart muscle which causes pain Do not try to selfdiagnose angina You need to seek professional care as soon as possible Take care Well your symptoms certainly warrant a checkup What youre describing could be something as benign nonlife threatening as a cyst or something more serious The fact youve had pain and swelling in the area plus a fever could point more to an infectious process than to something like cancer but only a physical examination by a medical professional can say for sure And either way this lump seems to need treatment Id suggest you make an appointment with your primary health care provider as soon as possible to get this lump looked at Wishing you all the best In case you didnt know it isnt caused by a worm at all Ringworm is actually a skin fungus just like athletes foot or jock itch You can get ringworm in a variety of ways from sharing a towel with someone whos infected to touching damp surfaces that carry the fungus The fungus that causes ringworm thrives in warm damp environments which is why its frequently acquired in places like public pool common areas To your question You could catch ringworm from your friend even if you didnt touch the lesion The reason is because the fungus could be infecting other areas of your friends skin but not showing the characteristic ring mark yet If you have thoroughly washed and DRIED the skin areas that came in contact with your friend youre probably not going to get ringworm However be careful not to share any sports gear or towels with your friend and be sure to wear flipflops or other foot protection if you all are bathing in a common shower area or something like that By the way ringworm will not clear up on its own It needs to be treated with an antifungal preparation Your friend can try using an overthecounter cream for athletes foot the generic name is miconazole but if that doesnt help or if the ringworm starts spreading your friend should seek medical attention In rare instances ringworm is best treated with a prescription medication Hope this helps Yes Im sure there is a rational explanation for this The problem is you wont get that explanation unless you see a medical professional for a physical exam Before I jumped to a conclusion of  Id think in terms of lessscary explanations like a problem with a disc in your neck That might account for the arm weakness Muscle twitching can be caused by several things including a mild potassium deficiency Is the toe twitching related to the arm weakness Maybe Maybe not Your primary health care provider is in the best position to start putting all the pieces of this puzzle together because he or she knows your medical history current medications and supplements and so on Id suggest you call and make an appointment to get the ball rolling toward a diagnosis Meanwhile I wouldnt get too worried about this being something scary like MS Well both hope its something easily explained and easily treated Wishing you all the best Im sorry youre going through this It sounds very unpleasant A number of things could be going on here but its not likely your gallbladder is involved The gallbladder is located on the right side of the body near the bottom of your rib cage Its doubtful the gallbladder could refer any pain to the left shoulder I can think of any number of reasons youd be having this pain from a slight fracture to a injury to an aggravated  The only way to find out whats going on is to see a medical professional for an examination and possibly other testing like an Xray Id suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider PCP to have this evaluated It would be helpful to evaluate it when its actually flaring up but that might be impossible to time Even if youre not having a pain episode your PCP might be able to come to some conclusion as to the cause of this pain and get you started on treatment Best of luck to you So sorry to hear youre going through this Pain in the left arm and the back is always concerning in terms of whether it could be heart related If you are a woman please read about the possible symptoms of a heart attack which can include pain in the left shoulder and back along with weakness on that side If you are a man or a woman and are experiencing any of  please get checked out by a health care provider right away Chest pain discomfort or heaviness Pain or discomfort radiating to the back jaw or throat Sweating nausea vomiting or dizziness Extreme weakness anxiety or shortness of breath Rapid or irregular heartbeats Now all that said its also possible youre suffering from a pinched nerve or muscle strain Nonetheless if the pain persists gets worse or if you begin experiencing other symptoms please see a health care provider as soon as possible Im sorry to hear you went through such a scary episode but Im glad it was a migraine and not a stroke Complex  is a term used to identify rare types of migraine headaches that have specific symptoms not usually associated with a common or classic migraine For example a classic migraine usually starts with a visual disturbance called an aura and then proceeds to a painful headache A complex migraine may fall under one of these types Hemiplegic which includes temporary paralysis or weakness on one side of the body often mimicking a stroke Retinal which includes loss of vision in one eye Basilar artery which usually affects young women and includes symptoms such as confusion and difficulty speaking Ophthalmoplegic which includes pain and paralysis of the muscles surrounding the eye Status migrainosus which is a severe migraine that lasts for days It sounds like you may have experienced a hemiplegic migraine or a basilar artery migraine Just because you had one migraine doesnt mean it will ever happen again Thats the tricky thing about these headaches Often doctors will wait to treat a patient until theyve had multiple migraines over a course of time That may be why you were sent home without any treatment If you have any questions about your migraine experience I suggest you follow up with your primary health care provider He or she can help you understand what happened and if you need treatment Wishing you all the best Any time someone tells me they feel pain and pressure in the chest I advise them to seek emergency medical treatment Although its unusual for pain to radiate down the right arm its not unheard of Also from men Because your wife has had more than one episode of this chest pain recently she should not delay in seeking a medical evaluation A simple EKG test can tell her if this is a heart issue or if its asthmarelated Please do not delay seeking a diagnosis of what is causing your wifes symptoms Hope this helps So sorry youre going through this You have every reason to schedule an appointment with a health care provider to get checked out In fact thats the only way to get to the bottom of whats causing your symptoms You need to get a physical examination and some blood work done Fifty is a milestone age in terms of medical testing When a person turns 50 there are several screening tests they should get such as colonoscopy So even simply based on your age youd be doing yourself a favor to have a physical exam I hope you feel better soon Im sorry to hear youre going through this Muscle spasms can be very painful and its miserable to feel you have to monitor every movement to make sure your back doesnt seize up again Id suggest you return to your health care provider to discuss this issue Your provider may want to prescribe physical therapy or recommend certain rangeofmotion exercises to help you get back to normal Your provider also may want to evaluate your posture and   which means the way you move Practicing good body mechanics is essential for preventing back pain and injury I hope youre able to get this problem resolved soon Im sorry to hear youre going through this How awful Youre right that certain antibiotics can cause an imbalance of good flora in the intestines and allow a bacterium called C diff to take over You should get checked out for this by your health care provider because if you do have C diff you need to be treated for it Clostridium difficile is highly contagious To avoid transmitting it to other people make sure you wash your hands frequently and thoroughly with warm soapy water Antibacterial hand rubs do not work against C diff The chest pain symptom may or may not be related to the antibiotic therapy Several conditions can cause the chest pain symptom you describe In women a condition called can cause the symptoms you describe Costochondroitis is basically an inflammation of the cartilage between the ribs and breastbone However because all of your symptoms occurred after the antibiotic usage you should report these side effects to your health care provider as soon as possible He or she will be able to thoroughly evaluate your symptoms and develop an appropriate treatment plan Best wishes This is a hard question to answer because theres not enough information Let me give you some general guidance If you friends rash came on suddenly and she is experiencing a fever she should phone not go to an urgent care center right away for further evaluation Sometimes a rash like you describe can indicate a serious infection If your friends bumps have been slowly coming on over time and shes not having any flulike symptoms then she should see a health care provider to evaluate what might be causing this rash Many things can cause the symptoms you describe including acne Only a health care provider can say for certain what is going on and this evaluation needs to be done in person Hope this helps Sorry to hear youre going through this It sounds like you did a great job of rehabbing on your own though The shoulder is a very complex structure If in fact you did injure your rotator cuff it can take a long time to heal Aggravating the injury through usage can make the process slower However its possible the problem isnt your rotator cuff at all There are structures called   in the shoulder too These are leathery sacs of fluid that help lubricate the joint Its possible to tear or otherwise injure a bursa sac around the shoulder which can lead to the type of symptoms youre describing Or you could have injured a ligament Like I said the structure of the shoulder is very complex Whether its your rotator cuff a bursa or a ligament the main healing factor is time Obviously something about the puckshooting motion and force is aggravating your injury which may increase your healing time If the pain becomes chronic or you feel youve reinjured the shoulder then its clearly time to have the doctor look at it again After all your great work rehabbing the injury you dont want to now undo everything Hope this helps If the dont clear up fairly quickly or if theyre accompanied by difficulty breathing your wife should seek immediate medical attention These can be the signs of a severe allergic reaction to something  food medication etc If your wife gets hives occasionally as some people do and they are not accompanied by other symptoms then Id suggest she speak to her doctor about getting a prescription specifically for the hives There are medications other than Benadryl that are used to treat hives In terms of combining antihistamines Id suggest you speak to a pharmacist While Benadryl diphenhydramine has a different chemical composition than Zyrtec cetirizine they still are both the same class of medication Generally we try not to combine medications of the same class unless specifically directed to do so by a physician I hope that gives you some clarity Its highly doubtful anyone would absorb a meaningful amount of nicotine in the manner you describe While it is possible to absorb nicotine through the skin like with nicotine patches merely coming into contact with tobacco probably would not cause a positive nicotine test Nicotine patches contain components that facilitate aid in the absorption of nicotine by the skin Thats necessary because the skin is a barrier that works at blocking substances that try to cross into the deeper tissue which includes the blood vessels Without help many substances such as nicotine and hormones which also can be delivered via a patch simply settle on the surface of the skin until theyre washed off Hope this helps Oh ouch Sorry to hear you went through this The sacrifices we make to look good right It sounds to me from your description like the wound healing process is proceeding along a normal course That brownishyellowish goop you see likely is caused by an excessive number of protein cells The body tends to overcompensate a little when trying to heal a wound like this Unless you spike a fever over 101F and start feeling nauseated or something youre probably good to go Im sure your doctor gave you wound care instructions You dont need to scrub that goo off but you can cleanse the wound with cool soapy water and pat dry The silver sulfadiazine was a great choice for this type of burn That stuff is nearly miraculous in my opinion A thin layer is all you need Eventually this will wound scab over It sounds like you might have a scar from this burn If that concerns you feel free to consult your physician again after its healed for some options about how to minimize the scar All the best to you Im sorry to hear youre going through this Of course its not possible to diagnose whats going on via a forum like this It could be your  but then again it could also be a problem with a in the shoulder  a pinched nerve in your arm or neck tendinitis muscle strain  quite a few things The only way to tell for sure whats going on and get appropriate treatment is by having a physical exam Even though you dont have insurance you may be able to find affordable care at a free or lowcost health clinic in your area Some clinics charge a fee based on a sliding scale Others such as healthcare for the homeless are entirely free You might be able to find these clinics by searching on the internet You might also want to see if you qualify for Medicaid coverage if youre in the US I wish I could tell you how to treat your problem but without a diagnosis its just not possible Some of the conditions I listed above may resolve with rest while others require medication or as a last resort surgery I wish you all the best Well thats kind of weird isnt it Im sorry youre going through this The shoulder and arm area is an odd place to get a rash or a breakout of something like  If the rash is happening only on one side its probably worth having a health care provider look at it though its probably not any sort of emergency If the rash is occurring on both shouldersarms then you might consider causes such as laundry detergent mild allergy or reaction dryer sheets wearing new clothes before washing them a change in the type of soap you use again possibly a mild allergic reaction or something along those lines If the rashblotchiness doesnt clear up on its own or if it gets worse spreads or your begin having swelling of the facemouth andor shortness of breath then you need to seek medical care Best wishes as you try to solve this mystery Im sorry about your accident I think you need to get this checked out by a medical professional The coldness of your hand and arm could be a sign of poor blood circulation related to your accident Poor blood circulation can lead to tissue death and other complications The only way to find out for sure if your injury is serious is to see a health care provider as soon as possible Particularly if your hand is grossly swollen a trip to an urgent care facility would probably be a good idea Take care Aside from the skin issue which Ill get to in a moment youre probably not drinking enough water Most adults should aim for 8 glasses a day though thats just a number someone picked out of thin air Clearly if youre just taking a few sips of water with your meds youre probably not getting enough water Now about that skin If youre talking about that flabby skin on the backbottom of your upper arms Im afraid I dont have good news Many women develop that loose skin and theres nothing you can do short of to get rid of it Even exercising the triceps muscles wont reduce this excessive skin Many women are prone to developing that excess skin by middle age It may be caused by having gained and lost weight over the years And who among us women hasnt gained and lost weight from time to time over our lives So Im sorry I cant tell you the flabby arms are due to dehydration That said I suggest you drink more water Its good for your overall wellbeing Wishing you all the best Im glad to hear all is good and I hope I can help set your mind at ease A in the neck can send pain radiating down the shoulder and arm  and even into the chest area which could indeed feel like the symptoms of a  Presumably you received an Xray or MRI scan of your neck This is usually how a pinched nerve in the neck is diagnosed Pinched nerves in the neck are often caused by compression of a disk in the spinal column of the neck This compression puts pressure on the nerve which in turn causes the pain Youre right that theres no relationship between a pinched nerve in the neck and a heart problem Its just that the pinched nerve caused you to have pain that was similar to what a person feels when they have a heart attack Hope this helps Im sorry you experienced this and hope it has cleared up by now Rashes can be caused by many things One important thing to remember is this If a rash is accompanied by swelling of the throat or difficulty breathing its time to call 911 These could be the symptoms of a rare lifethreatening  Luckily most rashes are not lifethreatening This can be helpful in figuring out whats going on with you If your rash has not gotten better by now your best bet is to see a doctor He or she can help figure out whats going on and treat it if necessary Best wishes to you Its doubtful you could damage a stainless steel plate from a blow that didnt even produce any bruising or swelling That doesnt mean you didnt aggravate the surrounding tissue or injure a different structure such as a tendon or ligament The only way to really tell whats going on is to see a health care provider for a physical examination Given your description however you might also choose to take a watchandwait attitude You can try resting the arm or avoiding those motions that cause pain to see if the pain clears up Sometimes a little rest is all it takes If the symptoms dont clear up or if they get worse  or if by some chance you develop a fever  then Id suggest you definitely seek medical attention Any time symptoms go from better to worse instead of viceversa its worth a trip to the doctor Hope this helps Whenever a health situation seems to be moving toward worse instead of better on the spectrum I always advise people to contact their health care provider for followup That seems to be the case with you and the breastarmpit lumps Even if everything came back normal four months ago these new symptoms deserve to be evaluated If Im misunderstanding you and the lumps were present four months ago when you had the biopsy and aspiration you still deserve an explanation for whats causing the lumps Its not enough to tell a patient its nothing and send them away You have the right to know what these lumps are and they could be simply noncancerous fibrous tumors or even enlarged lymph nodes for several reasons to set your mind at ease to understand if you need to seek any kind of additional treatment for help managing the pain I would suggest you start again with your GP If these lumps are new he or she will want to evaluate them If the lumps existed before he or she needs to give you a better explanation of whats going on Wishing you well Im sorry youre experiencing this It sounds like the situation is causing you some anxiety To answer your question 31 years old is not too young to experience heart symptoms Its true that heart attacks are rarer in younger people but theyre not unheard of However you had blood work done that didnt show any signs of a heart attack or heart disease other than hypertension Because youre concerned about the symptoms youre experiencing I think you should go back to your doctor for a better explanation about what may be causing them Several conditions can cause the symptoms youre describing and not all of them are related to the heart Getting an explanation would relieve your concerns Of course if you ever experience the signs of an acute heart attack such as sudden extreme chest pain squeezing or pressure shortness of breath pain radiating down your left arm or up into your jaw then you should immediately call 911 All the best to you The good news is this bump is on the skin Usually lumps on the skin arent serious in other words not like a breast cancer which usually resides deeper in the tissue Several things could cause a bump like you describe It could be a  for example If so the good news is it can be drained treated and probably wont return Other than that I wouldnt want to speculate Youve done the right thing by scheduling a medical appointment Try not to feel too anxious Soon youll know exactly what this thing is and then you can move forward with a treatment plan Feel better soon Sorry youre going through this but lets not freak out just yet  If your wife had similar bumps awhile back it does kind of sound like this might be caused by something in the environment Many things in the environment could cause the type of bumps youre describing anywhere from yes so good for checking on that to  However scabies requires treatment and since your wifes case cleared up on its own Id guess she didnt have scabies You did an entirely appropriate thing by applying hydrocortisone cream to the affected area to see if it would calm down the itching If the itching wakes you up at night you probably can safely take some diphenhydramine Benadryl by mouth to help calm things down Be aware diphenhydramine can cause drowsiness so use caution if taking it during the day If this rash doesnt clear up on its own in a few days or if it recurs Id suggest making an appointment with your primary care provider or a dermatologist to get an opinion You did a good thing by taking photos That way if your rash is gone by the time of your appointment you can show the provider your photos Hope you feel better soon Well I recommend you get this checked out Heart problems can hit like lightning heart attack or come on gradually It sounds like you may have a heart problem thats becoming gradually worse Of course this can only be determined with a physical examination and some other testing performed by your health care provider Chest pain that lasts 8 hours is nothing to ignore Please get medical attention as soon as you can All the best to you Im sorry to hear youre suffering from this The shoulder is a very complex joint so your symptoms could be caused by a number of things Usually when an xray is negative it means theres no broken bone which is a relief Unfortunately its not possible to diagnose an injury like yours in an online forum Youve done the right thing by seeing a medical professional and getting an xray That doesnt mean you shouldnt follow up and press for more details though In fact this is exactly what Id suggest As long as the shoulder isnt getting better continue to follow up every few weeks with your healthcare provider A few common causes of shoulder pain like you describe are a damaged  a injury and ligament damage Injuries to the bursa or a ligament will heal with time A rotator cuff injury may or may not it depends on the severity of the injury Anyway keep following up with your medical provider You may need to be reexamined to make sure you dont have a soft tissue injury that requires intervention Wishing you all the best If you have  its important to seek immediate medical attention Onesided weakness can be a sign of stroke Here are other common symptoms Sudden vision changes Sudden problems walking Sudden severe headache Sudden inability to speak Most of the time the symptoms of stroke come on suddenly but this is not always the case If your onesided weakness has developed gradually and seems to be getting worse you should see a doctor I cant think of any reason why anxiety would cause onesided weakness I suppose its possible it could be a medication sideeffect but this still deserves to be checked out I suggest you call your doctor as soon as possible Best wishes to you Aw poor baby You should be pretty safe using a product like baby powder or even plain cornstarch out of the box to treat this possible heat rash If the rash doesnt clear up within the day you might keep an eye on it Its likely nothing serious but it could be something along the lines of a fungal infection similar to athletes foot Be sure to gently cleanse the area with cool water and a mild soap Most important pat it dry thoroughly Dont rub because it will hurt As Im sure you know its not at all unusual for toddlers to develop weird skin rashes that sort of come and go Theyre usually only problematic when they refuse to go OR if the In that case its time to visit the doctor Wishing you and your granddaughter well Ouch Getting a tat is painful enough without then experiencing a hard lump underneath it Id suggest you see a health care provider about this Its possible the lump is scar tissue formation but its impossible to tell without a physical exam are a known complication of tattooing but these generally are smaller bumps in the skin If the tattoo ink is placed too deeply in the skin it can cause scar formation Your tattoo also may appear raised Again its impossible to know whats going on without having a health care provider perform an exam At the very least getting a professional opinion will help set your mind at ease Hope this helps Im sorry to hear you and your loved one are going through this Its hard to help when a person cant communicate Id suggest you have your loved one checked out by a doctor Whenever an elderly person exhibits odd symptoms the first thing that comes to mind is a  While these often cause delirium in a patient as opposed to the physical actions youre describing it might be a good idea to rule out a UTI At the same time a health care provider may be able to shed some light on why your loved one is exhibiting these symptoms Perhaps shes having pain she cant communicate Its hard to tell without a physical exam and a knowledge of her medical history I wish you both all the best Sorry to hear youre going through this Unfortunately diagnosing this problem requires a physical examination A number of things could be causing the symptoms you describe Anything from an injured ligament to a bone chip could be the culprit If this is an injury to a ligament for example rest is the main cure It can take awhile for that type of injury to get better I suggest you visit your primary care provider to get a diagnosis Your doctor can tell you what to do to treat this if anything Hope this helps A fall like the one you describe definitely can cause muscle stiffness and soreness throughout the entire body In fact a fall like that can cause painful back spasms in particular You should see a doctor if Symptoms get worse after 3 days or so You begin to have difficulty breathing or shortness of breath You begin to run a fever You experience numbness shocklike pains or a running water sensation in your arms or hands You have difficulty urinating Otherwise you probably are safe to take a waitandsee approach to this Muscle spasms and soreness may resolve on their own or they may require medical intervention Only time will tell Feel better soon Unfortunately theres no solid answer to your question Muscle pain and weakness such as the pain you describe is a known  Statin medications are used to  Im guessing your health care provider switched you from simvastatin to atorvastatin to see if it would help your upper arm pain The answer remains to be seen If your arm pain clears up then great If it doesnt then Id recommend you go back to your health care provider to discuss the situation There are many statin drugs to choose from Just because you experience a side effect from one of them does not mean youll experience side effects from all of them I hope this helps Good luck to you Im going to say that unless youre having trouble breathing you probably do not need to get an Xray done Its pretty hard to break a rib from an unintentional punch though of course anythings possible Even if the rib is cracked theres not much treatment for it except to bind it You might try using a wide compression Ace bandage to see if that helps the pain but dont wrap it excessively tight Gentle support is fine Another possibility is that you tore some cartilage between ribs That can be very painful and more bad news can take a long time to heal This could account for why youre still having pain The only treatment for this type of injury is rest and time If the pain gets worse over time instead of better if you develop a fever chills or flulike symptoms or if you suddenly have trouble breathing then its definitely time to get checked out by a doctor insurance or no insurance Otherwise I think you can take a waitandsee approach to this Overthecounter pain relievers used according to package directions might give you some relief too I hope you feel better soon Sorry youre experiencing this It sounds unpleasant Unfortunately its impossible to say whats going on without a physical examination Its possible this is a  in which case I would advise not popping it which can allow bacteria to enter the wound and further infect your arm but rather putting warm not hot moist compresses on it to draw out the pus If you are running a fever or have any of these other health conditions you should see a doctor Heart murmur Diabetes Use of an oral or inhaled corticosteroid such as prednisone budesonide Symbicort or fluticasone Advair Or if the bump doesnt heal up on its own with 1014 days I wish you the best of luck with this Im sorry youre going through this The symptoms youre describing could be caused by many conditions but a likely culprit is some sort of spinal issue Spinal degeneration is not uncommon as we age though I dont know how old you are and a ruptured disc in the neck can happen to anyone Either of these conditions can cause aching and tiredness of the limbs Id suggest you go back to the doctor to ask about these symptoms because it sounds like further testing might be warranted Blood work wont help diagnose a spinal injury or  I wish you all the best This is strange indeed The problem with skin rashes is there are so many things that can cause them Since the rash doesnt itch and presumably doesnt cause any pain its hard to tell what may be causing it Since this started about 3 months ago I would ask if you or your father by any chance changed laundry detergents dryer sheets soap or anything like that Perhaps the cause is environmental since the rash seems to occur in places where clothing touches the skin The only way to tell for sure whats going on is to see a health care provider Your dad can start with his primary care provider who will refer him to a dermatologist if necessary In the meantime it would be helpful to the health care provider if you could get some good photos of the rash both closeup and from far away Because the rash only occurs in the evening your dad may not be exhibiting the rash when he sees his provider Best wishes to you and your dad Ouch Oh Im so sorry youre going through this The symptoms youre describing do sound like ulnar nerve pain particularly the pain to the pinky finger Thats kind of a hallmark The fact the pain is increasing not decreasing over the course of three weeks means its time for a trip to the doctor Despite the manner in which you fell its possible you broke a bone in your arm or suffered a soft tissue injury to an elbow tendon or ligament The reason to get a physical examination and maybe an Xray is to get treated earlier when the prognosis is better rather than later when the prognosis is worse While this isnt an emergency you definitely deserve to be seen by your primary care provider to diagnose what is going on and make sure you dont have any hidden fractures either in your arms or your legs I wish you all the best with this psoriasis If so not to worry its quite treatable HI when I have lets say about Four glass of water or when my bladder gets full or even Three bottles of beer I am not a doctor just an informed medical consumer I would have someone take you to the emergency room Your symptoms are suspcious of bleeding in the digestive tract perhaps significant since you are lightheaded If you are reluctant to do that at least call your doctor If hes not available I strongly suggest having someone take you to the emergency room Yes it is part of the inflammation process You may want to try ice compresses for 20 min on then 20 min off and rest ProActive is the best daily product to keep your skin healthy and clearer than normal Its only about 2500 and it WORKS You also need to check with your family doctor or your Dermatologist to make sure that the type of acne you have isnt a more serious kind Do some research on the different types and severity of acne to better determine if yours is just the runofthemill common type that we all experience at some point in our lives or if it could be more serious Almost everyone in the world has had blemishes in their lives so dont let it get your confidence downweve all been there Caffine will mess with absorbtion of any drug or vitamin you should wait at least one hour or more before and one hour after taking meds or eating before any caffine intake Sounds more like allergy symptoms Its in the blood is what I have grown up hearing about poison oak once you have gotten it on you Always thought that statement was crazy until 6 years ago I accidently got it on me The rash has come up every year without fail in the same exact spot even when I have avoided the outdoors pets and all clothing and bedding washed repeatedly Tried just about every home grown or over the counter cure possible Usually just have to keep the area clean and wait it out The most horrid plant in the universe Allergies and sinusitis can sometimes cause swollen lymph nodes in the neck but these usually go away fairly quickly If you have noticed persistent swollen lymph nodes under the arm it would be best to have them examined by your doctor hi I had them during my pregnancies which is a very common time to have them Im all so told rapid weight can can cause them mine have gone away for the most part just give them time and if they still bother you speak with your doctor about your options There is not a lot of information about Limbarax Keep in mind that herbal products are not regulated by the FDA leaving plenty of room for consumers to believe a product works without knowing about the ingredients warnings side effects and dosages I would be cautious about using this product I would also encourage you to seek medical attention about the lower arm tremors to make sure nothing more complicated is going on No Have you been tested for Mono I would head to the doctor this is how my eczema started at 2 years old Its wise to get it checked right away so it doesnt get worse and cause you pain  Well you could have pulled a muscle Try ice and Ibuprofen That sound like signs of a heart attack I would def go to the hospital and get checked better to be safe good luck Keep looking bed bugs are surprisingly hard to find at first That and considering they can hibernate for up to one year without a food source is what makes them one of the hardest most durable pests to remove from your home You didnt mention your age however often as we get older we will experience hair loss in lots of areas The eyelash loss is puzzling and that would be a question I would ask my opthamologist Have you had your neck checked out I work for a spine surgeon and we see a lot of patients with tingling in arms hands and fingers And the cause is usually cervical radiculopathy caused by problems in the vertebrea When I have my pains it is in the middle of my back It doesnt start on the right or left It starts where my spine is and moves around to the front to where it hurts to breathe and move The only thing that helps me are two bags of ice for my back and just under my ribcage and either 2 alieves or 2 midols I had to checked out and was hooked up to a machine and everything They said it was my breathing but I cant remember if that was exactly the case I lost 41 pounds but I could still feel the start of it but I would take medicine before it could go any further This could be a pinched nerve Hi there first you should know that heart attack depends on the pain condition of the pain If the pain is dull then you could just get a drink of water If the pain is stabbing then you must go to a hospital Extreme chest pains can lead to heart attack and even death You must make sure that you get help from a doctor And he or she should give you chest pain medications You really should not play any sport that has to do with throwing because if you put too much stress on your arm you can hurt a bone or even crack or break one So if you want to get better faster then you should get some medical attention Tell your doctor what pain you are going through and heshe should give you some type of pain killer medication If you want to help out a stressed out arm then my advice to you is that you take Tylenol The reason that you are having skin burn when you sweat is because there are fats and toxins in your body that is not needed so when you workout you sweat and that is when your body gets rid of the fats that your body does not need which can cause obesity and death Your skin is burning so that it can get rid of the toxins in your body that can make you sick so be sure to take a good shower And also make sure that your hair is properly washed If it is not then the toxins in the sweat can damage your scalp and form hair dandruff Try ice and compression Definitely see a doctor about this They might refer you to a neurologist if they think its needed I the same symptoms and more on top of those and I did need to have some tests done YES you could have a ruptured disc in your cervical spine The pain in your armpit and chest area sounds like Mono I know because I had it summer 2012 and i am getting it again or lymphoma I have excema or dermatitis like that see your doctor for a hydracortisone cream that should help Unfortunately spider bites have a tendency to cause infection and I believe we may be at this point in this situation This could be the start of cellulitis which is a bad skin infection I would advise seeing a health care provider as soon as possible An antihistamine like Benadryl will not help I would watch the bites because spider bites can cause serious skin infections which usually require antibiotics Check the area where you sleep vacuum the area and make sure you keep windows and doors closed to prevent the spiders from coming inside I just got cured of it less than 15 minutes ago Mine took 2 months and only because I just had it pop back in during my sleep I just woke up from feeling the same pull and hearing the same pop as I let out a high pitched shriek and instantly realized that I had lifted my arm up over my head same position of how I hurt it see below and I felt immediate relief Im right handed and it was my right arm so I was constricted from regular normal use for closing a car door and even sleeping Really late on answering this question but thought it might help others I had that some years ago and it was after being in the ER and having injections in my IV port which went directly into my arm It caused severe pain and I could feel the pain travel up my arm as the medication went in I had an ultrasound done some weeks later from the pain that didnt go away and I had what I call like a rubber band as tight as could be that you could feel from my fore arm all the way into my armpit I ended up with phlebitis and blood clots in my arm from it all I had to give myself 2 injections of lovenox a day for 2 weeks to dissolve the blood clots Go see your Doctor is my best advice Your husband would need to be examined before a diagnosis could be made That said I found an article that has some general info about lumps and bumps that may be found on the body httpwwwwebmdcomskinproblemsandtreatmentsguidecystslumpsbumps A dermatologist can examine the skin for abnormalities and assess for appropriate treatment While age spots can appear as people get older it is important to make sure any new skin spots are not suggestive of something concerning A doctor can make that evaluation  Get to a doctor about your stomach pain and get that checked out as soon as possible The other symptoms exept maybe the itchy groin area can be attributed to Diabetes but again this needs to be verified by further examination by a doctor I hope you feel better but again please see a doctor about the pain as soon as possible and get a full blood workup which can provide insight on can be causing your other issues I would look at the sentence under the Answer  This Answer should not be considered Good medical advice and should not take the place of a LLMD doctors visit I added the words in brackets Personally I found the answer to this above very misleading Although she mentioned the controversy but she did not tell you about the overwhelming evidence against the CDCs view point on Chronic Lyme Disease You are not alone your are not the only one receiving answers such as this one as to why you are still sick You will see for yourself through the help of a Lyme Literate doctor that antibiotics can and will help improve your symptoms You will also begin to find that no doctor with a closed mind will be able to help you through this There is a group on Facebook called Lyme Disease Awareness go there and get the right information from 13k people just like yourself who have been denied long term treatment from doctors I was one of those people I had other doctors who said I was fine call these Lyme Literate doctors quacks That quack gave me my life back Go to the Columbia University Tick borne Diseases research Center website at the top there is a second opinion option in one of the menus click it and go see doctor Brian Fallon and get your answers there or at lymediseaseorg Hi No The reaction you described would not be considered normal If you experience a rash from a medication you should contact your doctor immediately It could be a sign of an allergic reaction to the medication or a serious side effect see a doctor right away you may be allergic to it It is very hard when a loved one is no longer able to communicate her needs to her caregiver In this case you need to be sure that she is safe and not in any pain or discomfort A checkup with her doctor is the first step The doctor will need to know how long she has been upset at night and if there have been any changes to her care or surroundings that

be fine after a two week rest After the rest she was pitching and she caught another line drive on the pitchers mound She felt something pull and we noticed her arm slump and she said she couldnt move

out good luck Hun  Hi I found this piece of info if this is you During a TIA one of the small blood vessels that supply your brain with oxygenrich blood becomes blocked Atherosclerosis is a common cause of narrowed arteries It occurs when fatty deposits known as plaques develop on the inner lining of your blood vessels This can cause your blood vessels to become thickened hard and less elastic making it more difficult for blood to flow through them Ok if this is you then simple cayenne pepper may help clear this plaque away for you there are many ways to take cayenne you can try capsules the ok but when the capsule opens inside you it can give you the cramps or like me you can mix cayenne with tomato paste and thin with olive oil to start with to a heat that suits you next time you mix you can add a bit more and so on take 3 small spoonfuls each morning wash each down with water now if you want because it very good for your blood do a jar of very fine chopped garlic and keep this in olive oil just add a spoonful on top of the cayenne before you take it All very good for you and give it a couple of weeks to start working at full strength Good Luck Hi Please dont over

stroll make it brisk for an hour Hope this helps Good Luck Hi Found you this nice piece of info from httpdermnetnzorgreactionsprogesteronedermatitishtml Autoimmune progesterone dermatitis APD is a rare skin condition in women that recurs in a cyclical manner corresponding to their menstrual cycles It is thought to be a response of the skin to the hormonal changes that happen just before menses Characteristically the skin eruptions occur during the luteal phase or the late premenstrual phase of the cycle This is when the blood level of the sexhormone progesterone rises The skin rash happens as an autoimmune response to the bodys own progesterone hence its name Within a few days of menstruation when progesterone level falls there is partial to complete resolution of the rash It will recur during the next cycle Some patients have had previous exposure to external progesterone in the form of oral contraceptive pills This is thought to presensitize patients to react against their own internal progesterone However not all patients with APD are exposed to previous hormone therapy It has been postulated that these patients produce an altered form of progesterone that incites an immunologic response against it In another theory progesterone is thought to heighten a patients hypersensitivity response to another allergen Diagnosis The diagnosis is usually made from the characteristic cyclical presentation A skinprick test with intradermal progesterone is helpful Positive tests with progesterone can be fairly rapid usually developing as urticaria within 30 minutes of inoculation or delayed with rashes peaking at 2448 hours Provocative testing with intramuscular or oral progesterone can be performed as an alternative Skin biopsy alone is seldom diagnostic A variety of histological features have been described Superficial perivascular mixed inflammation is the most consistent finding Treatment the skin problem is mild it may improve with topical steriods for eczema and antihistamines for urticaria Severe disease may be treated with corticosteroids The production of progesterone can be suppressed with hormonebased therapy This includes the use of conjugated oestrogen American spelling estrogen ethinyl oestradiol estradiol tamoxifen and danazol Women with autoimmune progesterone dermatitis should try to avoid medications containing progesterone including the combined oral contraceptive pill minipill depo injections The specific drugs to avoid include norethindrone norgestrel levonorgestrel Surgical removal of ovaries or oophrectomy has been shown to be curative in refractory cases Dop hope this helps you Good Luck Hi Could be a lymph gland swollen as well but more like it See your doctor Good Luck Hi And yes do know how it fills the best

disorder A rule of thumb for panic disorder is that your panic attacks occur three times in a 6month period with no apparent trigger Regardless I would encourage you to go see a psychiatrist or other mental health professional You are not alone in having these symptoms anxiety disorders are very common and someone like a psychiatrist would love to see you and help you out Best wishes  Sounds like this is either a rash posibly caused by detergents used on your sheets Or it could be burst blood vessels since they will start out as red dots then once the blood dries that would cause them to turn brown You are allergic to fish This very thing happened to me many years ago after eating Orange Roughie Then I noticed I would get nauseated just eating tuna or any other kind of fish Also fish oil supplement for omega 3 caused vomiting Now I avoid fish at all cost For Omega 3 I take Flax Oil capsules Its a bummer but it can be dangerous You could have a fibroid Or you could be pregnant and in the process of miscarrying I am not a doctor just have had friends that these were the dianoses when they experienced the same thing U truly need to have a work up done on ur heart Nothing to play with and it does sound more serious than just take a pill and chill im no medical doctor or anything but it sounds like it could have something to do with a nerve one with a wide neck so you can thread the injured arm though its appropriate sleeve first and stretch the neck up over your head and wiggle your arm though the opposite sleeve as you do so probably a tank top or something it is winter though so idk you probably shouldnt be running around out in the cold anyway vnecks are very stylish if that helps at all Hello snick1899 First you should get evaluated for possible serious injury or pathology You need also to rule out a spinal disc bulge or herniation at the level and region of your symptoms This is possibly a musculoskeletal straining injury that has not been allowed to heal sufficiently If you dont get this professionally treated try an overthecounter antiinflammatory medication regimen for about 5 days following instructions and warnings carefully on the product Longer use of pain relievers warrants a physician evaluation Just as important is limiting physical activity for a couple of weeks to give sensitive strained chestwall muscles ligaments and cartilage a chance to fully heal also the possible thoracic spinal disc injury You probably keep aggravating the healing process undermining your return to good health I currently am dealing with pain and spasms similar to what you describe and while it is very difficult to avoid activities I am determined as you might do to properly rest take OTC antiinflammatory medication and recover fully Best of luck and selfrestraint It could be Have it check to see if it is tendenitis Only if it is ask the Doctor for Keytoprophen It comes in two different strenghts and damn I couldnt believe how well it worked and the long term relief Its been over 8 years since anddddddddddddafter three different treatments using hyrocartozine injections and physical therapy Good product DAMN GOOD SECRETCAUSEPEOPLE WHO ARE CURED BRINGS IN NO MORE MONEY  You need to go see your gyno or family doc yes it can Yes the rash can return to same area months later Once you have been exposed to this plant and even thought the rash itself may have long since healed or faded away the underlying skin proteins remain sensitized to urushiol for quite some time in some cases several years hence the slightest newest recent exposure to urushiol in certain individuals will cause you to experience for a second or third time a newer rash Breathing in the flower pollen also in certain individuals will cause them to develop a rash Exposure frequency and time interval duration between each successive pi exposure to a large extent will determine how severe your rash outbreak will not only be but how long it will last I have had the same symptoms It could just be a pinched nerve or disc damage To find out for sure youll need to see an Orthopedist Neurosurgeon or Neurologist and get an MRI I had surgery for mine and was pain free the next day I am 73 years old female and have the exact same symptoms I went to my doctor thinking it might be shingles She said no it was probably some type of allergic reaction maybe caused by anxiety She recommended Claritin which can be purchased over the counter Assuming you did not strain or injure your arm I feel that it is related soley to your flu shot I think it important to address this issue with your doctor Sometimes the needle used for the injection can cause a hematoma  a pocket of blood at the injection site This can cause an sterile abscess or even an abscess that is secondarily infected Get it checked out The vaccine itself is not likely the issue but rather the injection Hidden under our opaque skin and subcutaneous tissue are nerves The nurse may have given you the shot in a wrong location or used a needle a bit too long or it may have been a fluke  hitting a nerve that shouldnt be there You will need to see your medical provider and perhaps see a neurologist Many times these postinjection neuropathies will selfresolve but you need to be examined Your inability to lift your arm is not something that can be ignored You may have a genetic condition called KERATOSIS PILARIS  Keep in mind that this is just a guess since I cannot examine you I suspect one of your parents have this as well This is a very common skin condition and very difficult to treat impossible to cure If it helps I have it too Do a Google Search for medical articles about keratosis pilaris Genital herpes tends to stay on the genitals and not spread to other areas on YOUR bodyGenital herpes is typically spread genitalstogenitals from one person to another It is always a good policy to wash your hands after scratching your genitals whether you have herpes or not Herpes is caused by a virus and those viruses can spread to others from freshly contaminated hands Lichen planus Based solely on your description this would not be typical of chicken pox varicella Search WebMD for some more information about this now uncommon viral infection While a child may get a mild rash about two weeks after a live vaccine like varicella it would not be typical just to get an eruption just on the toes The chicken pox lesion is a water blister on a red base often referred to as a dew drop on a rose petal If it is just on his toes I would be more prone to consider a contact dermatitis from his shoes or something he came in contact with while in bare feet Since I have no way of seeing it firsthand this is just a blind guess so please follow up with his health care provider if this rash does not resolve It is a problem if you do not know the CAUSE of your symptoms Rather than try and figure out what you have or worry about having a heart attack it would be best for you to be examined by a medical professional  someone that can take a thorough medical history examine you order an diagnostic tests and give you the true answer Unfortunately this is not something that can be done blindly over the Internet The pain of biting himself is just an odd form of stimuli common when kids are under some personal stress Change his bedtime rituals to include more time reading to him telling bedtime stories talking about his day things that may be troubling him rubbingscratching his back or hugging him Consider allowing him to listen to soft music or nature sounds so he can relax and have more pleasant monsterfree dreams That back scratch alone should feel much better than biting himself He may fall asleep as you rub his backfeeling his stress melt away Help him tell his brain that biting his arm is not something he should be doing and appropriately reward him for the progress he will make in stopping this habit Make bedtime a special timeyou may not have many more years to be able to do these bedtime rituals Poison ivy on the skin is not contagiousit will not spread from one area to another even it if is touched nor will it spread to another person It can seem to spread since areas with more exposure out first and areas that were lightly exposed may break out days later Assuming that the skin has be washed to remove the original plant oil it will not spead It is the plant oil that is the problem not any oozing from the skin lesions It does not need to be wrapped but you can cover it lightly to keep the drainage contained You most likely are having an allergic response to one of the ingredients in the deodorantantiperspirant so you will need to do some shopping I have the same problems One of the best ones that I found personally was made by Arm and Hammer but unfortunately it went off the market Had I had known I would have stocked up It took me a while and then I found Soft n Dry which went off the market too I am now using Dove a little bit on the girly side but it works and no itching I am not sure if any of these will help so it is really trial and error One additional suggestion Before putting on deodorant rub in some 1 hydrocortisone cream This may help the itching and control any mild allergic response Or you can move to parts of Europe and give up deodorant entirely There can be many causes for itchy skin but one common cause that can occur in those areas would be atopic dermatitis eczema Experts say that atopic dermatitis is not a rash that itches but rather an itch that rashes so itching is the primary symptom Of course when these areas itch you will scratch This can create an itchscratch cycle that can only be broken by 1 take an antihistamine like Claritin or Zyrtec to control the itching 2 reduce the inflammation by using hydrocortisone cream and finally 3 do your best not to scratch especially to the point where you may break the skin This will set the stage for a secondary infection and make things worse It is not possible to determine the nature of a rash based on a vague description so you will need to see a medical provider so you can have this allover rash properly examined diagnosed and treated Since you are concerned that this could be a consequence of unprotected sex seeing a medical provider is even more important If necessary the medical provider can test you for HIV and other sexuallytransmitted diseases You left out a very important fact the AGE of your son If a child was under three to six months old we take any fever quite serious but if the child is older fever rarely gets the attention of a seasoned medical provider Why Because fever is not dangerous even in the 105 range It is the bodys response to fighting off an illness in kids this is usually a virus You do not have to rush him to the hospital with a temperature of 1023 unless you enjoy sitting for hours in a crowded ER while other patients go in front of him You are not unusual in your fear of fever Fever is one of the most normal yet least understood symptoms RELAX Fever is higher in the evening lower in the morning so it always goes up and down Whether you try to reduce it with acetaminophen or ibuprofen will not really help the illness but it will make him feel better Even though fever is not dangerous it does make a child feel yucky so it is okay to treat for comfort The real issue is not the fever but the CAUSE of the fever Your son should be examined to see if a biological cause can be determined You can take him to an Urgent Care facility or just call his pediatrician for patientspecific advice Not knowing your sons age this answer is the best I can do for you Because you are taking blood thinners it is very likely that you bled quite freely under the skin when that vein was compromised Blood is just fine when it is INSIDE a vein but when it leaks OUTSIDE the vein this hematoma can create quite a bit of inflammation  perhaps the reason for the local redness warmth and swelling It is not possible for this blood leak to get back in your arm to cause a blood clot If this area does not improve with ice compresses it would be good for you to consult your medical provider so you can be properly examined Maybe your right arm is healthier just kidding We are not equal on both sides of our body and a blood pressure test taken on one side can be very different than the other side This is why it should be taken on BOTH arms to get a better average Of course in your case the left side is a normal blood pressure and the right side said you are hypertensive It would be best to get a several dozen more readings on a home blood pressure machine at different times of the day sittingstandinglying down and in both arms Record all of those readings and report them to your medical provider Welcome to the club I have had two rotator cuff surgeries and BOTH have failed I am very reluctant to have the third surgery as you might imagine Your first step is to have another MRI to see if your surgery worked Not knowing the details of your surgery the reason for your injury age and any other shoulder damage you might have I cannot really comment further You pain may be due to inflammation or  I really couldnt blindly guess Consider having a second orthopedic opinion from a shoulder specialist If it is not onesided as you mentioned it is something else other than shingles but unfortunately without the ability to see it firsthand during an examination I would not be able to narrow down the many possibilities for you based solely on your description You would need to see a medical provider so you can have these skin lesions properly diagnosed The only definite 100 way of determining if a skin lesion is a skin cancer or not is with a biopsy Either the entire lesion  or a piece of the lesion is removed and analyzed by a pathology lab A skilled clinician like a dermatologist can give you a prettygood idea but a visual inspection can be wrong Because of your family history of melanoma it would be wise to get it checked out I know of no antibiotic that would cause arm soreness There is most likely another reason for those symptoms I dont knowthis is something that a medical provider would have to see firsthand during an examination perhaps with some skin magnification Sorry that I couldnt help but making a blind decision like this is very very difficult She most likely has a hematomaan accumulation or pocket of blood under the skin This is just a guess however since I have no way of seeing or examining your daughter over the Internet She would need to see a medical provider for a handson examination to confirm this assumption In the meantime keep up with the cold compresses Nothe trigeminal nerve does not go down you arm or to your hand The nerve that services this area comes from your neck cervical spine I am not a big fan of selfdiagnosis and selftreatment when it comes to a possible rotator cuff tear I have had two of them including two surgeries followed by LOTS of physical therapy While you will be able to find exercises on the Internet my advice to you is to see an orthopedist  one that specializes in shoulders  have an MRI and see what the heck is going on BEFORE you start any type of selfprescribed physical therapy that could make things worse There is a great medication that you can try but it requires a prescription It is called DrySol aluminum chlorhydrate I have used it with great success with many of my hyperhidrosis patients They are also doing surgical procedures for this odd affliction now and using Botox You can find information about this by an Internet search for Hyperhidrosis surgery This surgery is expensive so having your insurance pay for it may be futile DrySol is cheaper and safer You need to have your arm by a medical providerand have an xray Symptoms alone are not sufficient to determine if you have a fracture or not They certainly could be Bedbugs  small ovalshaped wingless insects that feed on the blood of mammals including humans  are making a big comeback all over the country Bedbugs get their name from the fact that they often hide in mattresses during the day after feasting on sleeping people at night Unlike ticks and fleas bedbugs dont carry diseases But the itching can be severe the bites can become infected and some people develop allergic reactions Other bugs bite in the night of course including fleas mites and lice But there are several telltale signs of bedbug infestation They leave lines of red itchy bites on your skin they deposit tiny blood and feces stains on your sheets and mattress and you find the actual bugs in small crevices such as mattress seams baseboards picture frames and floorboard cracks If you find a bug put it in a plastic bag and take it to your local vector control agency for identification Then call a pest control company for advice Getting rid of bedbugs is no picnic and youll want a professional handling the insecticides Depends on how hairy you areif you were Sasquatch you could certainly have head lice on nonhead areas Mostly head lice live on the head occasionally the eyebrows and body lice live on the other parts including the clothing The pubic area can have pubic lice aka crabs You will need to see a medical provider so that you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated There is really no way to blindly make a determination about your concerns over the Internet I am sorry Nothe arm may or may not be swollen and the child could still have a fracture or dislocation What should happen That nurse or medical assistant should be retrained Other than the inflammation which is obvious there should be no long term residuals I am a bit concerned that you may be having a lymphatic reaction the red streak so you medical provider needs to see this and make sure you do not have a secondary infection from this avoidable mistake Dont pay for this extra office visit either You will still need a proper PPD and it should be absolutely FREE and if you need the pneumonia vaccine administered properly of course I would insist on a freebee as well As much as I would like to help you it would not be possible for me or any medical professional to diagnose your boyfriends skin eruption based on your vague description I dont knowI cant examine you but based on the limited information that you shared you need to remain on those antibiotics that I assume your medical provider gave you A rash on the arm does not imply the infection is in your bloodstream septicemia Septicemia causes high fever lethargy and you are very very ill Yes you can rebreak an arm but it will take an xray and a careful examination to make that determination The fact that your arm is hurting more and more each day is an indication that you need to seek handson medical care While there are many other nonfracture reasons for arm pain these cannot be sorted out blindly over the Internet No that is not a typical sign of early pregnancy since sharp headaches can occur in anyoneeven men The fact that you are experiencing tingling and right arm pain as well I would strongly suggest that you consult your medical provider  someone who is familiar with you and your medical history and someone who can examine you in order to determine the underlying reason for your symptoms The causes of psoriasis is really unknown I can vindicate the cats as a cause however Cats can cause allergic responses to the skin but cats do not cause psoriasis We use a very accurate and easy URINE test for Chlamydia and gonorrhea called a DNA probe The urethral swab can still be used but the urine test is easier and less traumatic for the male patient A blood test can be used especially if testing for other STDs like HIV or syphilis Recurrence rate for tinea versicolor can be as high as 60 so this is relatively common Taking another course of the prescription drug Nizoral ketaconazole would be the most effective The amount of selenium in Selsun Blue is really not sufficient to help Please read the label since not all Selsun Blue labeled shampoos contain selenium If you want to also use a topical selenium there is a prescription one that is considerably better Selenium sulfide 25 lotion Other topical many overthecounter antifungals will also work if you use them for 24 weeks As much as I would like to help you with this dermatological puzzle it would not be possible for me or any medical professional to offer you an specific explanation or diagnosis for these red spots blindly over the Internet In order to be properly diagnosed and treated a medical provider would need to physically SEE these spots and take an extensive medical history  obviously not something that can be done online You would need to have the doctor who made that comment explain what they meantI am not very skilled at mindreading Calcifications in the lungs or in the many blood vessels in the lungs may not be clinically significant and the doctor may just have been thinking out loud Since I cant see the xray or the report to comment only your doctor has the ability to explain If you have isolated the underarm rash to the deodorant then you may have your culprit Hydrocortisone 1 used three times per day would be the recommended treatment for contact dermatitis but it is not a cureall Sometimes your medical provider will need to prescribed a topical steroid that is stronger I do not believe there are ANY labs that could detect a trace amount of any spider venom seven years after a bite nor that I can believe a venomous spider bite would still be causing lymph node reaction now I would strongly recommend that you see a medical provider and have these nodes properly examined there can be MANY reasons and perhaps have a few diagnostic tests If the injection was given improperly it is very possible to involve nerves in this area Since it has been a month you should be examined by your medical provider or the place where you received the injection They are completely different You can find plenty of chicken pox varicella photos on the Internet Obviously I have no way of seeing what your son has so you will need to take him to see a medical provider for a proper exam diagnosis and treatment Yes something is clearly wrong with your mother and you are very sweet to be concerned Unfortunately it would not be possible to diagnose your mother let along treat her over the Internet in this forum Your mother will need to find another medical provider to exam her  one that does not think that her symptoms are weird Please encourage her to do so There are sooooo many different reasons to account for her symptoms that it would be impossible to blindly solve it with a simple posting She will most likely need some diagnostic tests so if this involves travelling to find a new medical provider or to have her seen at a larger medical facility this is something you may need to do I have no way of determining if your arm is broke over the Internet since I dont know the details of the injury location severity or have the ability to examine you Only an xray can give you that answer Other causes to consider that may account for your symptoms would be nerve compression from the contusion sustained during the incident Again you will need to see your medical provider to have a definitive answer  not something that can be done in this forum Benadryl is very effective for hives because of the fast onset of the medication but only lasts about four hours Zyrtec tends to be slower in onset but lasts longer 24 hours Both are antihistamines of course and most of the time you only need one of the other On some occasions however when you have taken Zyrtec in the 24 hours you can still get hives so it is safe to take a dose of Benadryl Benadryl does cause sedation so please be careful if you need to drive You definitely want an antiperspirant not just a deodorant Ask your doctor about using DrySol  a prescription aluminum chlorhydrate antiperspirant used for people who excessively sweat hyperhidrosis It may help Allow her to be examined by her primary care medical provider first There may be a logical reason for her symptoms and hopefully and easy solution I can help you with advice but unfortunately a brief description is not sufficient to be able to offer you a definite answer as to the nature of your breast lump You will need to see your medical provider for a careful examination and perhaps some imaging studies Many lumps on younger women are cysts but this important call cannot be made blindlyyou MUST have a proper examination Are you sure it is psoriasis Psoriasis is very challenging to treat so she should most likely be under the care of a good dermatologist Itching can be controlled a bit using an antihistamine andor topical steroid creams but the scales on psoriasis tends to be so thick that a prescription steroid cream is usually recommended I would not be able to blindly address your question as to what it is since I cannot see these sores  a vague description is just not sufficient I suggest that you see a medical provider or a dermatologist  someone who can physically examine you  in order to get a proper diagnosis and treatment You are most likely getting hives Hives can be caused by the temperature change that you mentioned You can try taking a longacting antihistamine before these warm season exposures loritidine Zyrtec Allegra to see if it helps Urticaria caused by temperature changes may not be prevented by antihistamines however but it is worth a try Keeping your skin surface cooler would also seem to be a reasonable preventative wearing clothing that breathes This is called cold urticaria one of the more unique types of hives You can try using an antihistamine before cold exposure but it still may happen Unfortunately there is little that can be done other than avoiding these cold situations Nothing is wrong We both know that you have plenty of bloodit is just a problem trying to get it out The skill of the phlebotomist may be in question Using a smaller butterfly needle may have solved the problem Some veins are smaller and more elusive so going to a larger vein in the arm should have been easy if your arm is not too large Veins are typically palpated felt rather than viewed when it comes to drawing blood If the tourniquet was not on tight enough or long enough the vein may not have distended If all fails many phelbotomists will put a warm compress on your arm and allow it to dangle down a bit It could be HUNDREDS of different dermatological conditions and it would be impossible to blindly guess what you have over the Internet Since this has been going on for two months perhaps it is time for you to see a medical professional  dermatologist so that you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated The term abnormal is quite vague It simply means not normal When it comes to a biopsy the most important question would be if this lesion was cancerous or not Some lesions are read as abnormal when they are precancerous lesions You will need to get a more thorough explanation from your medical provider ask for your exact pathological diagnosis and then inquire about the next step This could involve excising the lesion wider and more completely various treatments or just watchful waiting All you really know now is that your biopsy was abnormal You need much more information from your medical provider Everyones temperatures varies about two degrees a day from the average 986 with the evening temperature being the highest morning is the lowest I dont know the age of your child but even a real fever is NOT DANGEROUS and this mildlyelevated temp is medically insignificant if he is healthy and well No a chicken pox shot will not leave any spot or mark You would need to have a varicella blood titer to determine if you had the vaccine or the disease The only spot that was ever left from a vaccine is from the SMALL POX vaccination which has not been administered for over 30 or 40 years now Yes hair lossother than your scalpcan be a consequence of aging Since arm pit hair is not medically important nor cosmetically pleasing to some people I dont think this type of hair loss should be concerning Hundreds of different things can cause allergic reaction including the doxycycline but neither has sulfa The prednisone can help fight an allergic reaction an antihistamine may also help You dont have insurance and I cant see them over the Internet so we have a dilemma The only way that you can get an accurate diagnosis is for him to see a medical provider or dermatologist but your guess is very good These may indeed be molluscum contagiosum  very common childhood skin eruption If you didnt see the dent in the middle called an umbilication look closer with a magnifying glass It may be there Yes this is possible Lymph nodes react enlarge and become tender in response to inflammation and Shingles can certainly do that There is really nothing topical in the form of a cream that will help the skin lesion discomfort There is an analgesic syrup for the inside of the mouth viscous lidocaine by prescription that you can swab if her medical provider prescribes it Ibuprofen helps with the lesions on the skin unless her pediatrician gives her a codeinecontaining pain medication She will need to specifically ask her doctor but I suspect he will not allow her to take buffered aspirin either I agree that she may need more than just Tylenol to control the pain so this is another item that needs to be addressed Many medical providers undertreat pain Your mother is 88 and deserves to have pain relief and be comfortable without being overly sedated Her doctor should be able to help with a different medication There is really no good treatment for this genetic skin disorder Some people have use desquamation solutions chemicals that peel the skin and topical steroids but in the end this skin condition not a disease will typically return I do not believe that using laser hair removal on keratosis will have any lasting benefits either and I do not believe that this is an approved or acceptable use of this device Yes there is a topical prescription medication called DrySol that you can use on the sweaty areas This is a potent antiperspirant Assuming you do have shingles your description was not convincing a person must have had chicken pox in the past A new exposure to someone with chicken pox may give you shingles herpes zoster Since chicken pox is contagious a day before many people do not know who exposed them 2 or 3 weeks prior Chicken pox varicella is very contagious by direct contact or fomites objects contaminated by the varicella virus Shingles is really the same virus but fortunately not as contagious One can get it by direct exposure however I dont know the details of your case not all fractures are the same to be able to determine if pain is appropriate four weeks after casting but my guess would be NOit is not normal You need to see your orthopedist again for a reevaluation Sometimes improperly placed casts can cause painful pressure areas or your fracture may have shifted Nogive them your right arm to take the blood pressure reading This issue has come up many times on WebMDs Ear Nose and Throat Community  and there is a few things you can try You are correct The weight of your head on your pillow is either restricting circulation to your outer ear pinna or you are causing some nerve compression You can adjust your sleeping position to avoid this overcompression but old habits are hard to break An ENT colleague suggested that you get a foam pillow and cut out an earsized crater in it This way your ear can rest in a little bed of its own without causing undo compression It may work but this is not something you can buyyou will need to make it The worst that can happen is that it will not help You can try softer pillows or pillows of different shapes as well Some people will sleep on the other side of the bed so they will tend to turn their head a different way Even if you slept with your wrist flexed under the pillow you could wake up with a numb tingling hand so the the only answer to this problem is either changing your sleep position or creating that special pillow Unfortunately it is not possible to accurately determine a skin diagnosis blindly over the Internet A desciption is just too vague so this is going to require a handon medical examination by your primary care clinician or a dermatologist You cannot accurately diagnose a rotator cuff tear by symptoms alone and certainly not as a selfdiagnosis Even your doctor may have difficulty unless an MRI is ordered Take it from someone who had a rotator cuff tearYou need to see a good orthopedist and probably need to have imaging studies like an MRI Your first and most important step is to get an accurate diagnosis which is based on examination findings You may need to see an orthopedist for a higherlevel examination If the orthopedist feels that you would need imaging studies then so be it but right now getting an MRI may be premature Antiinflammatory medications can definitiely help but again having a definitive diagnosis is critical so get a referral to a specialist I dont know the details of her fracture type severity which bone etc but assuming she does not have any swelling inside the cast there should be no reason she cannot fly Because I lack these details you will need to call the doctor who put on that cast The real challenges may be after you arrive in the Bahamas The big issue will be swimming If you have a waterproof cast it may be fine as long as you rinse it outover and over againfrom any salt water exposure You can buy a waterproof cast cover assuming you can find one that is the right size so she can still enjoy the vacation No cast is sand proof so that is going to be an issue as well A medical provider or dermatologist would have to physically SEE these spots and examine you A vague description of dry scaly spots is really not sufficient to make an accurate diagnosis Unless a medical provider could see those spots firsthand during an examination it would not be helpful for me to list the hundreds of possibilities that could result in wrinkly spots It would not be prudent to make a blind guess over the Internet so I suggest that you see a dermatologist for an examinationa year is a long time A fluid diet for eczema Never heard of it as part of any treatment Eczema is geneticallydry skin so if you are having an exacerbation or worsening of your symptoms you may need a change in treatment The mainstay of eczema management is moisturization  so find a good moisturizing cream that is free of perfumes Topical steroid creams are very helpful but the best ones require a prescription Call your medical provider Control itching with antihistamines assuming you can take this type of medication Please avoid scratching and digging at these areas Open eczematous skin can become secondarily infected  so if you think your eczema is infected you will need to consult your medical provider for treatment usually antibiotics Eczema is usually with you for life so finding the right combination of medications and supportive treatments is important I dont think a fluid diet for two weeks is going to help in any way It would not be possible to diagnose anyone based solely on a photo nor could your little girl be properly treated over the Internet You will need to SEE a medical provider so this can happen If this is an infection she may need an antibiotic have the infection tested for the type of pathogen or may need to have this bump surgically opened She is only a year old so infection can become more serious relatively quickly so do not delay getting her the proper care Valtrex will not help a rash related to mononucleosis There are THOUSANDS of medical conditions that can result in a rash so it would not be wise to associate your sons mono with your rash The rash seen in mono does not usually itch Since I cannot see your rash and examine you over the Internet I would advise you to see a medical provider so you can be properly diagnosed Obviously without the ability to examine your son firsthand I would not be able to provide you with a definitive answer but if those little pimplelike bumps are firm and pearly and have a tiny belly button umbilication in the center you have to look very very close then they may be molluscum contagiosum  You can do an Internet or WebMD search for more information and some pictures Molluscum are very common viral wartlike skin lesions found in children I treat them with liquid nitrogen freeze them or use a chemical blistering agent called cantharidin Your son should first be properly diagnosed by his pediatrician or primary care medical provider It would not be wise to try and treat them over the counter until you have a definitive diagnosis Lots of things can cause an itchy rashthousands of diseases and conditions in fact You and your sister need to be medical examined so that you can be properly diagnosed and treated  not something that can be accomplished over the Internet The average normal temperature under the arm 987 axillary is about one degree less than the mouth 986  and about two degrees less than the rectal temperature 996 Keep in mind that these are just average temperatures based on a poorlycontrolled study using inaccurate thermometers done over a hundred years ago We still adhere to it even though we now know the average is slightly different Temperatures also vary by the time of day lower in the morning higher in the evening If you are transmitting information to a medical provider you do not have to add or substract a degree All you need to do is say The temperature was 998 under the arm Let the medical provider make the adjustments Unfortunately without the ability to actually see this skin eruption that you are describing it would be very difficult if not impossible to blindly offer an accurate diagnosis A diagnosis is really essential when it comes to treatment Knowing your medical history will also help solve this mystery rash Based solely on your description this could be an allergic reaction perhaps urticaria hives Hives are intensely itchy comes on suddenly and if the allergen is still in your midst it can continue to persistspread Regardless of the cause which can be very challenging to find the itchiness can be treated with an antihistamine like diphenhydramine Benadryl or other overthecounter medications in this class Seeing a medical provider is important since many things can mimic hives A medical provider would need to physically SEE your sons upper arm bumps in order to make an accurate diagnosis A vague description unfortunately doesnt do it With that said one possibility of many would be a common skin condition called keratosis pilaris  that actually runs in families You can do some research online and I am sure you will find plenty of information including some photos If this doesnt fit the bill he should see his health care provider or a dermatologist for a proper examination and diagnosis Poison ivy or oak is caused by exposure to the olioresin oil of the plant It does not come back in the same place two months later unless you were reexposed to the oil again The oil can remain stable on an object for years so you dont have to come in contact with plantjust an object that still has the oil on it Please be sure you actually have poison ivy Many skin eruptions can mimic this allergic disorder and some can even show up in the same place like eczema shingles etc Yes Very simply put your heart is on the left side of your body so that would make pressure readings different from side to side Hi What a wonderful way to put that  Just relax Mabe a warm shower and a pain pill or muscle relaxer Dont try to do too much Thats my problem I tell myself that Id rather be in pain than have to lay in bed Keep the FaithSandy Please stop taking so much aspirin It will eat the lining of your stomach Have you been to the doctor or ER Go if not Good luck My teenage son had a similar issue We first ruled out any bites bumps or allergic reactions Thanks to his hair cutter it was from wearing hats too often especially a plastic lined one that didnt allow his scalp to breath She suggested using Tea Tree Oil shampoo and Tea Tree  Lavender Conditioner It worked great Hope it does for you too  You should probably go to your primary care physician to get a blood test for pregnancy My youngest child never had a sore throat with strep When he went back to school every year I could count on a call from the nurse within two or three months and it would be strep He would have a rash on his torso and no other symptoms I can only state that after having lumpnodes removed from breast cancer did I have the same feelings Dont scare your sister but has she had a mamogram recently The armpit though most forgotten has a lot to give Could be blood poisoning Hi If this is a new condition it could be a contact dermatitis This means that your skin is reacting to something it has come into contact with that has irritated that portion of your skin While it might not be poison ivy you could have a sensitivity to something else See if you can go back and figure out what might have set off this skin condition In the meantime keep it clean and dry Apply a small amount of over the counter cortisone cream to see if that helps the itching The deep wrinkles you are experiencing are most likely from sun damage Your initial approach should be to wear sunscreen at all times If you live in a very sunny climate consider wearing UV protective clothing In addition you should continue to moisturize your skin with a noncomedogenic non poreclogging moisturizer Your moisturizer should also contain hyaluronic acid which will help plump the skin cells Sun damage dehydrates the skin So it is important to drink plenty of water to rehydrate all of your cells Skin tags are benign noncancerous overgrowths of skin  typically in skin folds  that are fairly common with pregnant women However you should have your dermatologist evaluate your skin to eliminate any growths that may not be benign Thinning of the skin on your forearms can be attributed to a variety of reasons this includes a genetic predisposition weight loss  and certain medications such as steroids catabolic can lead to thinning of the skin Also as we age the rate of collagen formation under our skin will decrease This may also be a contributing factor to thin skin its a normal reaction it means that you are slightly allergic to alcohol It sounds to me like seed warts My daughter had them and i let the Drs burn them off and she has been scared scene I am not sure how to get rid of them but maybe you should check it out No This sounds like a pinched nerve or possibly nerve damage CATMRI will be required for diagnosis I had the same problem It is very important for your sister to see and Orthopedic Surgeon Bone spurs in the shoulder cut into the rotator cuff once the cuff is torn the only thing to do to correct it before it is totally useless is to have surgery It can be same day surgery but does require several weeks of PT I now have full range of motion in my arm and my strength is great I will say it was very painful but now it is worth it I didnt know how to edit my question sorry but I have included a picture of the bruising there is a medium sized bruise and under the skin I can feel a lump that sends a weird feelingpain down my arm towards my wrist when touched Picture httpimg826imageshackusimg8266942img00000012jpg I have been applying ice on it here and there and it seems to feel better but I am worried I might have a clot  no Have you been diagnosed with a pinched nerve Are you having any pain Here is some information on that state that the most recommended treatment is simply rest But in some cases physical therapy can help as well Talk to your doctor about which type of treatment might work best for you The WebMD Answers Staff Sorry to hear that youre hurting Here is some information on from here at WebMD that I hope will help you focus your conversation with your doctor If you havent already you should let your doctor know whats going on and get his or her feedback The WebMD Answers Staff Its possible it popped back in the wrong way but that is if you actually dislocated your shoulder Other than that its probably just a strain The pop mightve been from stretching your muscle too far and it cracked Kind of like the same thing that happens when you crack your neck or hands The crack is caused by the muscle fiber stretching to far and it rips with with a snap Its why cracking causes muscle weakness you have less muscle but it does give give you more flexibility If you did actually dislocated your shoulder I would recommend seeing a doctor yes there is tingling in my finger tips and when I go to bed at night in morning it wake me up hurting bad  It sounds like it You should go to the ER 20 years ago my husband and i both got shingles at the same time i was 36 and he was 56 we had just moved out of an apartment complex where there was at least 10 cases of chicken pox with the little kids i had chicken pox as a child but my husband said he did not when we asked the drhe said it is not contagious that when my husband was little he probably had a minor case and no one knew i asked how that could happen my doc says when one person gets chicken pox the next person to get can be so minor they only get 1 or 2 chicken pox and go on never knowing they had it or the virus i have hypoglycemia and whenever i have low blood sugar i feel like im going to pass out and vomit My limbs go numb and soon i puke The monster shouldve provided enough sugars to keep blood sugar at normal but if she doesnt eat she may need more Try getting sugars into her from juice or a candy bar Thats normal Bruising and soreness usually occurs after donating blood especially if you have small or shallow veins It happens to me every time the first thing I would ask is which muscles I have found that when I drink a lot of coffee my eye lids will twitch if you drink coffee I would suggest cutting back I hope this will help you good luck Chances are if you have lived in the US for most of your life you have been exposed to Chicken Pox even if you didnt show symptoms The virus remains dormant in your body and then reactivates as Shingles  any more questions contact your local pharmacy Pharmacists are very educated on Shingles and there is a vaccination for it as well which is recommended for anyone over 50 1 out of 3 people will get Shingles in their lifetime The best bet I would think is to go to a dermatologist I also found this slideshow of common skin conditions that might give you a better idea of what yours might be I would go to the doctor or the pharmacist to see what they have to say If you say it looks infected then it will probably need medicine I wouldnt wait either Here are the most common Fibromyalgia symptoms Seems like there are a lot of treatment options both medication as well as stuff you can do at home From the article linked to below Good skin care is a key component in controlling eczema For some people with mild eczema modifying their skin care regime and making a few lifestyle changes may be all that is needed to treat eczema Other people with more severe eczema may need to take medications to control their symptoms Nondrug treatments for eczema include Mild soap and moisturizer  Its best to use a mild soap to avoid over drying your skin Gentle soaps known as syndets are available at the drugstore and brand names can be recommended by your doctor A good moisturizer in cream lotion or ointment form helps conserve the skins natural moisture and should be applied immediately after a shower or bath as well as one other time each day Some people with severe eczema may benefit from taking baths with a small amount of bleach added to the water The bleach helps to kill bacteria that lives on the skin of people with eczema Short warm showers  People with eczema should avoid taking very hot or long showers or baths which can dry out your skin Reduce stress  Take steps to reduce stress Get regular exercise and set aside time to relax Medications used to treat eczema include Hydrocortisone cream  Overthecounter hydrocortisone cream may help mild eczema Prescription steroid cream may be needed for more severe eczema Antihistamines  Oral antihistamines such as Benedryl are available overthecounter and may help relieve symptoms Some of these may cause drowsiness which may be of benefit if nighttime itching is a problem Corticosteroids  If other treatments fail your doctor may prescribe oral corticosteroids Always follow your doctors directions when taking oral steroids Light therapy People with very severe eczema may benefit from therapy using ultraviolet light Immunosupressants Medications that suppress the immune system may also be an option These medicines such as cyclosporine azathioprine  or methotrexate  may be used when other treatments have failed Immunomodulators  This newer type of medicated cream helps treat eczema by controlling inflammation and reducing the immune system reactions Examples include Elidel and Protopic  Heres the original article httpwwwwebmdcomskinproblemsandtreatmentseczemaunderstandingeczematreatment I get the same thing it is the osteoarthritis in my cervical neck that is pinching on the nerve thru my arm I also have carpet tunnel syndrome with this and that can hurt the entire arm as well my hands go weak the arm muscles and I get tingling and numbness at times therapy and shots in my spine did not work sometimes I will put on my wrist splints when it gets bad stop what im doing and sit for a while till it subsidestake many breaks thru the day The stuff in your face is probably the cervical neck osteo pinching and herniated discs that may be in there and you probably have TMJD with your jaw I wear a jaw splint for that too or I have gone to chiropractors and done exercise for the neck and jaw I also take Cyclobenzaprine for jaw and neck pain and my fibromyalgia and it works wonders or I take Ibuprofen too if the other drug isnt enough for the pain I try ice and heat too YES Go to a doctor  now If you cant afford a mammogram let me know and I will get you in contact with a place to get one for free no Yes this is exactly what I have But I also have scoliosis the worst kind some exercises are out of range for me mainly the ones you have to twist and stretch fighting battle for me Im no expert but I wouldnt be surprised if it was just a placebo and he started blinking thought he had a problem with it and then continued to blink more and more because his brain thought he had a problem so the brain made it so he did have a problem It shouldnt be too big of an issue so I wouldnt be worried you should of had physical therapy see the surgeon this could be a tension headache I have experienced the same thing  it is very scary The doctors attribute it to extreme acid reflux I am taking medication for the acid reflux and it helps however every now and then I eat more of a food I should eat in moderation  I overpower the medicine and once again have radiating pains in my chest throat and jaw Hope this helps  ask your doctor Good luck do you have a history of neck problems Do you have any history of heart problems or high blood pressure or cholesterol Compare your symptoms with cervical neuropathy and for cardiac arrest I think it has more to do with your neck but you didnt give much info and I want to make sure you check cardiac issuesjust in case have you injured your neck in the past It sounds similar to cervical neuropathy Do a search and see if the rest of the symptoms match yours As I have found out over the past 2 yrs hallucinations can be caused by a number of things I would recommend talking to a psychiatrist My son started having hallucinations 2 yrs ago His hallucinations we found out were caused by anxiety Hallucinations can also be caused by depression among other things Talk to a therapist or a psychiatrist than can assist you with your hallucinations I dont have an answer That is why I asked the doctor if you are female this could also be symptoms of heart problems such as coronary artery disease If you ARE STILL having these issues but only on an irregular basis I would definitely consult with a cardiologist I experienced the very same symptoms and only through my persistence and a caring doctor did he find that I had one artery that was 70 blocked While performing the angiogram the doctors also discovered I had an artery behind my heart with a 99 blockage and of course they fixed that first I had no idea something as simple as a painful neck such as the typical stress related pain could possibly be heart related in any way It then started to cause pain in my elbow and I thought I had twisted it doing something I received about 3 injections in it before the I started to experience other aches and pains normally attributed to aging issues but at 60 years old thought I was just showing more signs of the aging process I was fortunate enough to find a doctor that knew something had to be happening so I went through many tests that would always come back as normal although the symptoms remained The worst part was that I would never have consulted a heart specialist for any of my symptoms had another doctor ask me if I would mind seeing one of his colleagues A heart doctor for neck and elbow pain I thought it couldnt do any harm and when all tests came back as normal I thought I was wasting my time until they suggested an angiogramand I have to admit I was just as shocked as they were when they discovered the hidden blockage behind my heart that did NOT show on any of the tests they performed on me If you are female see a cardiologist and dont wait Since you only injured it only a day or so ago It takes time to heal And looks like it has been a week now You should have some relief You may also have had some nerve damage Since you did have it rrayed and seen by a Dr And they found no fracture Give it more time to heal If you are still having problems in 46 weeks from now I would see an Orthopedic Dr for follow up get pain from neck shoulder down the middle of the right armfeels like a burning sensation going though the veins In all likelihood it could be a group of muscles that is bunched up or a calcium deposit that will work itself out HOWEVER it could be something as severe as a blood clot or cancer cell cyst type of thing I would definitely not let it sit considering the rate of growth Schedule an appointment with your doctor if it is not gone in twenty four hours or so If it grows much bigger than that DEFINITELY seek medical attention i wish i could help but i dont even know what she put in her arm as Im not familiar with most drugs I suggest you plan an intervention or call 911 if life threading nerve damage to your hand well it could be ticks  talk to your doctor about it well she has celiacs disease non life threatning disease but she can not have wheat so feed her corn based products like  some chex mix cerals corn tortillassome soups any thing that says gluten free on the label  vericose vains most likely if there purple or blue if you use ace wrap its normal to get itchy red bumbs on the area some medications cause numbness some meds cause numbness get second opinion from nerophysician Spider bite Cant help you with both questions but my husband was often asked if he was on blood thinners because of so many bruises on arms and hands He was NOT on any thinners but 4 years later he was diagnosis with Myleodisplastic Syndrom MDS which is a disease of the bone marrow where the platelets and red  white blood cells are produced Because he is in his 70s there is no chance of getting a bone marrow transplant You might recall a cohost Robin Roberts on Good Morning America ABC was lucky enough that her sister was an ideal match I just wished that some doctor had looked into my husbands problem of the vast amount of skin bruises years ago After 10 months Robin rejoined her show and looks great Perhaps youre not old enough for this to apply to you but keep in mind if you have older relatives who bruise for no apparent reason The only true way to find out if you are pregnant is to see you physician for blood work and if further studies are in question as possible Ultra sound to detect a pregnancy out side of the uterus One last little bit children can be conceived while you are on your period I have seen a few I had the same problem suddenly occur on my left side in the same spot as you describe above Im 53 I went to a doctor who sent me to a physical therapist And with the physical therapists directions over a four week period the pain went away completely Even after the first visit I could significantly tell a difference It was a seizedup muscle that required specific isolated careful stretching He also did deep tissue massage with some machine called Hivamat i think you should take rods advice hon i too had rotator cuff repairbicep and then cuff again when the dr did the cuff repair the first time he said that the bicep was only torn about 8  so he thought it would mend itself 5 months later took an mri and the bicep was torn by 65 so i went in for bicep surgery 5 months later another mri because i was still in pain needed rotator cuff repair again and trigger finger release surgery this last time my shoulder felt great a week after surgery but my finger was in pain and just didnt feel rightunfortunately i had a back pain and jerked my shoulder just a little bit which started pain in my armshoulder once againwent back to the drhe gave me antiinflammatory cream to put on my finger and shouldermade an apptfor 6 wksand sent me on my way i had this last apptgot tired of waiting 115 min later so i tried to get a new dr  they all keep saying they cant help me try going to the university hospital  so this is where i am at i guess what i am trying to say is that you definitely need a dr to look at it and if what your dr prescribes isnt working or if he decides you need surgery  get a second opinion I have peripheral neuropathy it manifests itself in numbness tingling and pain I probably got it from chemotherapy but its hard to know for sure I have had surgery on my rotator cuff because of natural wear I had a problem that if I raised and then lowered my arm the shoulder hurt when I lowered my arm it turned out to be shoulder rotator CARTILAGE problem The pain disappeared after a few moments after I lowered my arm Sounds like you may have a boilespecially if is tender and warm to touch it only tingles when my ear rings i do not have a herniated disc From my daughters experiences possible nerve impingemen in prone position is this your first time taking loratadine Have you experienced muscle cramps before you took loratadine Do you have any changes in your workout routine recently If needed you should stop taking Loratadine and see if these symptoms are improved if they are dry and scaly it could be eczema YES GO BACK IMMEDIATELY i had it after a c section and it can spread to other parts of your body that are compromised the doc will give you more meds take them all and watch for signs of it happening again now that you know what to look for thats my advice coming from my own experience This sounds like either pinched nerve in your neck or maybe even fibromyalgia You need to get this checked out There is not much in the means of expediting a bruise but you can take ibuprofen to reduce the swelling Also eat foods that are higher in llysine amino acid because it helps your body absorb calcium and obviously drink milk I did those three things and it helped me get back on the basketball court in 2 weeks from a hairline fracture on my elbow It sounds like Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Can be caused from excessive use or repetitive use Try wearing a wrist brace at night or when over using in daily routine It can cause permanent damage if not addressed Seek medical advice could be the medicine your taking or something you changed like laundry soapfabric softener ete I have the same problem I thinkIt is not dried blood I know that It is not like anything I can find online or in any text book I have I hope we both find our answers I have an appointment on nov 6th Hopefully I will know something then Relationship919829717996 husband Wife love problem solution baba ji if its recommended This is very strange as I have heard of people having severe allergic reactions to fire ant bites however I have never heard of a case where the reactions lasted as long as five years I would go to the doctors just to make sure there is nothing else that could be causing this it depends does your doctor say you have osteoporosis yeah yeah i know it sounds like an old peoples thing but just ask your doctor Do these areas itch Do you eat a lot of lowfat or diet foods or drink coffee with liquid creamer If you answered yes then you might be having an allergic reaction to Carrageenan No not HFM nothing in her mouth her feet or hands just on her limbs and trunk of her body i wish i could post a picutre on here  as long as your not using it any more the rash should go away if its not gone by a week consult your doctor try not to iratate it and keep it dry sweating will iratate it and make it itch i had torn my tenden on my ankle and it heal itself but takes a while usually you should be able to take overthecounter pain killer med but if the doctor gave you instructions on what to do follow it if it get worst go see them I have had all bone and blood test and neck and lower back xrayd and examined no abnormalities I have read many articles in the past that sometimes when a virus is leaving the body is does so in the form of a rash But if youre still in doubt just call your drs office and ask for the nurse The nurse should be able to advise you No it doesnt sound like itwhen do you experience the electric shock Wow thats sounds alot like me  Actually as we age we all have some degenerative stuff somewhere There are great doctors out here so I would pray ask God to help me find the right one Dr That is and I understand pain its real and I know friends that have a severe pain in the back and they found out that they needed surgery The recovery was long but shes doing great and thanks be unto God that shes walking around better than what she was I will be praying for you and please pray for me not surebut maybe have your sugar checked sometimes a low sugar level will case thattry orange juice and peanut butter crackers if handy a sugar and a protein but definitely consult a dr u are not alonemy mother and I and other members of my family get them on their arms it started as we got older we dont know why they are exactly perfectly circular but I think as we age our skin thins and we bruise easilya bruise is just bleeding under the skin if u find an answer to the perfect circle id like to know My mother has had the numbness from elbows to the tip of the fingers and she has been diagnosed by her doctor with RA She also has carpal tunnel syndrome on one hand Since now I am experiencing the tingling sensation and numbness when I wake up in the morning of my right arm elbow to the fingertips I have discussed it with her Mother worked at UT Medical School for 23 years and knows a lot about medicine and the human body She calls these symptoms PreArthritis Find a good Diagnostician and discuss your symptoms with him or her Why would you want to take two antihistamines You may want to talk to a doctor and get a stronger prescription antihistamine if either of these are not very effective for you My experience was an allergic reation to an antbiotic I was eventually diagnosed with exfoliative erythroderma It took a about two months and a ten day hosptal stay to get that diagnosis The longer no action was taken the worse the condition got My reconmendation is to persue this untill you have a finite action plan My diagnosis came from a dermotologist that was recomended and arranged by my allergy and asthma doctor Treatment was long over a year and I experienced many complications well yes it could Typically blood clots because there is a tear in the vessel and the platelets stick to close the vessel back up As you heal the clot will break off and essentially disolve and be no more Blood can also clot if the flow to a body part is cut off or if a person has been sitting for a long time like in the car or on an airplane I assume youre asking the question because youve done this to yourself As long as it isnt painful I wouldnt be too worried as I am also going to assume that the constriction wasnt TOO tight because if it was I think you wouldve noticed it sooner Could this cause you damage yeah it could It could kill you actually check out the article at the bottom If any of the things in it apply to you then go to the ER and try not to move your arm as you are going there clot could break off But Im getting ahead of myself You are most likely completely fine Look at the article and take the appropriate route httpwwwehowcomhow5323620tellbloodclothtml IM NOT A DOCTOR JUST GOOD AT MEDICINE While Im not a doctor and Ive barely started taking medical related classes the immediate thing that comes to mind is that you are pinching a nerve or that it is at the very least nerve related To solve this issue you can ice or heat whatever feels the best for you stop putting your head back and get some extra sleep If this continues for longer than 3 days with no improvement you need to go see a doctor If this comes with any other symptoms such as pain you NEED to see a doctor sooner than a few days Good luck Yesit could  I would go to the dr and be checked for herpes I hate to tell you this but I only know cause I have them the dr told me 85  of people get it and dont even realize it  you can get it even wearing condoms it is the most sexually transmitted dieses out there  also can be contracted from someones mouth to genitals if they even have the being sign of a cold sore  I suffered from psoriasis too but I was cured now It was bad and makes me very unhappy I live in China Here we use Traditional Chinese Medicine to treat skin problems I went to many hospitals like this and tried many different treatments but the effect is not very good until I went to a hospital in the North of China It works and now I am a happy person again I am glad to share this with you you may not able to go there but you can talk to their doctors for advice you can find more information on the website of vitiligotcm Psoriasis is caused by blockage of skin with wind damp heat and pathogen The symptoms are usually red papules that occur on the skin of the scalp trunk and extensor aspect of limbs The papules gradually expand and merge into patches or plaques with thick silver scales on the surface The patches or plaques are of irregular shape some take the shapes of map or island yet some are smaller but more with the appearance of starry sky and with the scales shedding off layer after layer A layer of red film can be seen by scraping off the scales gently and small hemorrhage dots can be seen by scraping off the red filmswwwvitiligotcmcom curevitiligoaliyuncom It could be tendonitis or carpal tunnel due to repetitve strain injury You may also get numbness or tingling in the fingers or hand and wrist It can cause the symptoms you are describing If keep having symptoms I would see an orthopedic hand specialist to get diagnosed Marieh9 my niece had something similar that was long lasting it was a form of viral infection that was recurring It could be from a plant or some kind of poison oak that you wernt aware of may be in your yard some bodys house or being out in the woods you have the same thing almost like I have going on with me but mine is on my right inner thigh itchy raised dry rash Im just using over the counter antiitch cream good luck nopain is on my left side No This is usually caused by high blood sugar Have your blood tested Or it can be caused by drinking alcohol or toxic chemicals In any case you need to have blood work I had the same symtoms Mine started behind my right ear then in my neck and shortly later in my shoulder and down my arm But after a year pain started on my left shoulder and arm My hands and fingers started going numb and tingling My first MRI showed a little disc bulge Couple of years later the MRI showed stenosis I had surgery Helped but a year and half later I got internal scar tissue and I have stenosis from that which is displacing the spinal cord So now Im worst than I was So good luck Also an MRI always doesnt show the problem until it becomes bad I think there are other tests that can help Or maybe you need another pathogist to read Your MRI AND see a Orthopaedic specialist and get on a payment plan I realy hope you havent come down with carpal tunnel in wrist and arthritus that is causing the arm weakness But all of those are better options than learning that The thorasic part of your back is messed up The arm pain may be as simple as you unknowingly holding it differently through the day and the rest sounds like middle back issues I am full of more opinions than i am at winning over a jury So the jury is out and if i were right you go see no less than 2 of the top ten neurologist because second opinions are always a good idea but dealing with neurological pain you make sure you see a established dr and then one that has been in his field 3440 yrs of age Lots of conflicting new procedures out there cortisone injections have helped me tremendously over the years I also had my nerve endings burned and that really made a big difference in the amount of pain I experience I had basically the same thing happen to me I was driving in high holiday traffic during December on the BQE in NYC for my nieces Baptism All of a sudden I was going numb on left side of my face and scalp as well as feeling weak but had no pain Then bam my eyesight went and came back I panicked and managed to pull over I had no idea what was happening to me I thought I was having a stroke and my heart was racing because I panicked So it felt like a heart attack My boyfriend drove us the rest of the way and I went to the ER to be checked out I had an MRI CAT scan Echo blood drawn for tests etc I was vamped pricked and prodded by 4 different doctors Then the neurologist saw me and said he thinks I had an atypical complex migraine headache and a mild panic attack I was told to avoid several things All of which lead to migraine headaches and for me most are not avoidable but some are You better believe that the things this doctor listed pretty much was like a check list for my 6 hour drive I worked a 10 hour shift skipped dinner drank 4 20 oz cups of coffee and had a chocolate bar all while arguing over navigation issues with the BF Also was stressing because I was the God mother and if we were late to the church my sister would never forgive me I was also surprised to learn that when I would get stressed at work I would get a mild headache with a tick or fluttering eye muscle and floaters in my eye and that it was a migraine but with out the pain I now keep a headache or migraine diary and try to figure out what my triggers are The biggest ones for me are sleep stress and caffeine Just know that you arent alone in this and you might never even have another one again It helps to just take care of yourself and avoid caffeinestress  I would suggest setting up an appointment with a dermatologist When I was diagnosed with eczema by my general physician I was prescribed Triamcinolone Acetonide which didnt do much It was later found out that I had psoriasis your description sounds similar to my symptoms and I was prescribed Clobetasol Propionate for two weeks followed by Triamcinolone Acetonide for 6 weeks or until the symptoms disappeared Im no doctor but I have a lot of experience with rashes as I have suffered from psoriasis for many years I would also suggest visiting an allergist as they would find out what is causing the flare ups Eczema is typically allergy related if Im not mistaken Lastly I would suggest cleaning all her laundry and bedsheets with sensitive skin detergent arm  hammer is great Is she allergic to any foods Maybe you could keep track of what she eats and see if you can pinpoint the flare ups to any particular food Like I said do not take my advise to heart only my suggestions as I am not a physician Hope I helped and good luck A dermatologist can prescribe a medication that is much stronger than what you get over the counter I had a rash for a month before I went to the dr It went away within 3 days after I took the prescrioption level cream I have severe numbness in my arm and hand while sleeping that wakes me up causing restlessness and anxiety from lack of sleep what could cause this Its more than likely muscular Go get a massage Find a therapist that is NMT certified Hope that helps Is your bicep really big That may explain it  The main answer that I can think of is its your nerves It can be just stress related Have you been under more stress the past two or more months You could be suffering from anxiety andor depression and not even realize it No that does not mean that you are psychotic or look and behave just like the people in those antidepressant commercials either If you look those conditions up you may find many symptoms that match not just your pain but possibly other symptoms you may be experiencing too There is also the possibility that it could be nerve pain I suggest that you take some time to think about not just the pain you are feeling but also what other problems are you experiencing You should talk to your doctor about the pain and anything else that is bothering you andor maybe causing you to behave unusual to others around you You may also be having problems with circulation You should just go see your doctor an if youre the type to forget what you thought about wanting to ask then think about what you want to ask and discuss the day you set the appointment write it down or even write down everything you want to say and bring it with you Well I hope you do find out what is causing you that discomfort and get some relief If you want to you can let me know what you found out The main symptom of pleurisy is pain in the chest This pain often occurs when you take a deep breath in or out or cough Some people feel the pain in the shoulderDeep breathing coughing and chest movement makes the pain worsePleurisy can cause fluid to collect inside the chest cavity This can make breathing difficult and may cause the following symptoms Bluish skin color cyanosis Coughing Shortness of breath Rapid breathing tachypnea Pleurisy may develop when you have lung inflammation due to infections such as pneumonia or tuberculosis This inflammation also causes the sharp chest pain of pleurisyIt may also occur with Asbestosrelated disease Certain cancers Chest trauma Pulmonary embolus Rheumatoid arthritis Lupus COPIED FROMhttpwwwncbinlmnihgovpubmedhealthPMH0002347 It could be nerve pain I go through the same thing only in my right leg Mine is caused by a back injurypain that goes around my side down to my groin causing pain and continues all the way down to my feet My husband has RLS also If he doesnt take his meds a couple of hours before bedtime his arms flail violently along with his legs Are you on medication for your RLS If you are and still having problems you might need your dose adjusted My husband had to have his adjusted after about 10 years on his medication called Pramipexole Mirapex i dont think you have anything to worry about seeing how worms are very common in dogs  puppy almost always have something like that  i feel that if there was a chance that the kids could catch em more kids in general would have them u know what i mean i think ur babies are in the clear  now that ur pup is done with his medsjust relax and enjoy him rememebr just like kids dogs only stay lil for so long  hope this helped i would go to the doctor  it very possible that the shoulder pain can go down the arm  and since you cant move it all the more reason to go they can give you something for the pain and possibly phyiscal therepy to help you feel better untill then no more cat litter lifting and it can take a while for shoulder pain to go away so take it easy as much as you can hope this helpes and feel better  i would go to the doctor and talk about this tell the doc about what happend to you grandma  it sounds like it could be something that can really make problems  the basics when a body part falls asleep as we say thats due to lack of bloodflow to that part of the bodycould be that somethings stopping your bloodflow to your hands that could have been the same thing happening to your grandma or it could be your nerves which means something in ur brain of on the way to your hands is breaking the signal  because our brains tell our bodies what to do with small electric chargers  think if it like this you have a short in your house and your lights flicker  kinda the same idea  either way def go to your doctor for this  even more so cause your grandma is having the same problem  it likely that this is somehow connected through geins  hope this help and good luck i have had trouble with my shoulder for many years after 8 years which was way to long i had lost all movement it was like having a dead arm  i also had poppingmy advice is go to the doctor have them do an xray seeing what you did its likely then will recommend some excersies for you to do  dont try to move your arm move then it will go without pain cause if you let this go and done take care of it  it can get really bad i had to have reconstruction surgery and my arm will never be the same theres alot things i cant do now that i may have been able to if i would have taken care of it from the start you dislocated your should is what it sounds like  i myself have had that happen many times  it is also possible that all the pain your still have cause its normal to have pain for a while but when the pain begina to move through out your back and arm its possible it didnt go back in correctly  i would go to see the doctor dont let it go untreated i left my shoulder untreated for 8 years long story short in the end i had a dead arm couldnt use it and had to have reconstruction surgery believe me it wasent fun and ill never have the same movement again im sure the doctor will gove you something for the pain do an xray possible mri if he feels its bad enough and have you do some pt phyical therapy hope this helps also try not to move your arm to much untill you know what going on  and dont try to move it in a area that causes more pain what the first person is right but i want to add if this pain contiunes you shoud talk to your doctor about phyical therapy because if left untreated could become a big problem i didnt have that shoulder problem i had an everything kinda shoulder problem cant remember what it was called but i can tell you i had to have a total reconstruction surgery and ill never use my arm the same way again so just try to get it looked at before it becaomes a real problem hope this also helps It sounds like it most likely related to your ovary on that side It is possible that you may have a cyst that is causing your discomfort It is also possible that it could be your appendix but seeing as how you have had the pain going on for 3 weeks and are otherwise asymptomatic that is unlikely Time to go back and visit the surgeon Call his office and make an appointment today I had a fall a month ago and hurt my neck and shoulders it was a fall down a rocky hill I have the shooting pain down both arms and into the fingers I have already waited longer to return to dr than I should have My rotator cuff tear was undiagnosed for 10 years  Ive also had three Left knee surgeries  My point is your body is not going to get better by itself And get all of your questions answered and write them down in case you wish to get a second opinion I also have peripheal artery disease I had severe pain in my left calf when walking the right also hurt but not as bad I saw a vascular surgeon who did some tests He scheduled a procedure where he put a scope in to my lower arteries When he did this he said it was worse then he thought He put 2 stents in the artery on the left and 1 stent on the right No more pain I can walk without the severe pain in my calves My legs will feel fatigued when walking the doctor said its from the low blood flow but without the pain it is so manageable Im seen by him every 3 months my legs are checked with the pressure cuffs each time Maybe a vascular surgeon could help you with some of the pain youre experiencing Good luck Based upon my personal experience along with my husband daughter and now hundreds of people that I have come to know through a variety of venues I am a professional counselor with 30 years of experience your symptoms can absolutely be attributed to persistent borrelia Lyme infection and perhaps coinfections I strongly recommend you review the International Lyme and Associated Diseases ILADS website for uptodate and accurate information Because of what comes down to what is now willful ignorance many doctors are poiltical hacks rather than physicians like the expert who gave you horrible advice on this forum Whenever you have significant physical trauma that results in an injury inflammation will occur on the site where the most impact occurred When inflammation happens some people will develop a low grade 999 oral temperature fever due to the body working hard to heal itself Sweating could be contributed to such a fever as you are warmer than usual It could very well be related or have other causes I would definetly see a doctor just to make sure nothing was injuredespecially since you are pregnant its good to be on the safe sideGood luck YES most definitely Especially if there is no reason as a bump or hit to your body that would cause a bruise Anemia is associated with bruising but your symptoms seem more serious Vitamin C supplements help thicken the skin but need to be taken in large doeses Personally I took 3000 mil daily until symptoms disappeared Time released vitamin C taken morning noon and night daily with offer results within 30 days So I see that some people insist poison ivy cannot return months later and others say it can And who is right Absolutely the people who say it can return are right Last summer I had poison ivy around my ankles Many months later in the winter a milder version of the rash returned I was not wearing the same clothes not sleeping on the same sheets and not touching anything I had used outdoors I was not working outdoors at all Moreover even now a year later though I dont have the rash around my ankles if I scratch my skin in that area the red bumps and the itching will return Currently I am recovering from poison ivy rash primarily on my face and neckunrelated to last years episode I have taken Prednizone for a week and never again will I take a stereoid No wonder all those NFL players are killing people I have washed all my clothes sheets etc in hot water twice The rash on my face has almost disappeared but I have little outbreaks here and there in odd places like a bump on my arm or on my back But I have not worked outdoors in more than 2 weeks The poison ivyas someone else saidis surely in my system I wish I could prove it so that people like me tormented by this vicious plant wouldnt look for answers and receive erroneous ones from socalled professionals What has worked better for me than anything is white vinegar It stings on the bumps and openings in the skin but the stinging is not worse than the itching I apply it liberally with drenched cottonballs until my skin is dripping and I wait for it to dry naturally Then I rub Itch all over the nowdry area There may be better methods but the vinegar dries it out makes thick scabs hideous but effective the scabs fall off fairly soon so thick they make a plopping sound when they fall ugh gross Ive been able to sleep with this method maybe having to get up once in the night to reapply the vinegar or just grope for the Itch and rub some inwhereas last year using other treatments I could not sleep Other treatmentsVicks VapoRub Clorox so good for your liver cortizone creams and other overthecounter meds have not done so well Havent tried tobacco but Im an xsmoker and if theres anything that makes me want to smoke its lying awake all night scratchingso I had to forget that A pox take the next creep who writes that the best treatment is avoidance I hope you get to dance to the tune of poison ivy at least once The plant is everywhere I hope this helps some other poor sufferer ItchyScratchy Found out from the American Society for Clinical Laboratory Science that the amount of nicotine absorbed by skin depends on how much was absorbed and how long it was on the skin A level of 54 which is what the test came back indicates some exposure but much less than that of a tobacco user Most patients using tobacco products excrete nicotine in urine in the concentration range of 1000 to 5000 ngmL Most definitely I would see my dr immediatelyor if notthen call 911 or go to your nearest er bc these could either be potential symptoms of a heart attack or a stroke Have your self checked out for a possible blood clot I had the same thing happen to me a few ears ago and that is what they found in my right lung I have had shingles and I only had it around my upper back but I know it can apprear just about anywhere I would highly reccommend seeing a doctor because even though it can go away without antibiotics I believe it can also get worse and be very miserable It is up to you if it seems to be improving then maybe you dont need to but if its spreading then you definitely should see a doctor It can get pretty serious if left untreated I would not recommend going around someone who is pregnant even though shingles is spread through direct contact just because it can be very serious and it isnt something someone who is pregnant should be exposed to something went awry you should see a dermatologist I am a professional tattoo artist and in all my training I have never heard of this you cant inject that much ink and it doesnt synch up with scar formation or normal infections Most likely an irritant got into your skin via your fresh tattoo could be environmental or from an insect best to have a doctor look Thanks for your question its an interesting topic I just read a new study regarding numbness in different areas of the body The study said that all through the spine there are small nerves that are connected to every part of the body Sometimes when youre stresseddont feel good or your spine is misalinged even slightlyit can make those nerves fire off and cause numbness in the part of the body the nerves are connected to Your friend doesnt automatically have Neuromotor Disease or anything serious like that She just needs to start with a chiropractic consultation who if need be can refer her to a spine specialist if it is indeed the nerves in the spine firing off I hope this helps in anywayat least so you or she can know where to start looking at No httppmahoneybuythistodayinfo The best thing to do is just keep it clean  if you want to cover it to protect it from being hit rubbed or dirt then use gauze  change it often to keep it from sticking Yes If you think so go to the doctor yes you need to have it surgically removed if it is done properly and packed from the inside to heal you have much less a chance for it to come back i had a pylonital cyst that was the size of a baseball that was draining i had it lanced and drained and wicks put in but it did not go away until i had it surgically removed being diabetic the infection feeds off your diabeties causing high sugars which will cause the infection to get worse too and yes because of your diabeties you can loose your arm or worse if you do not get it taken care of properly Maybe you should get your nerves tested I had a neck injury that was not visible from my MRI and CAT scans and was effecting my right arm I was feeling nerve pain down my right arm and tingling at my fingertips and also had weakness in my arm When I injured myself my spine pinched my nerve that runs down my arm I have had bad rotator cuffs and frozen shoulders in both shoulders The docs had me do therapyshoulder exercises for 6 months before I had surgery for the first one and all I did was therapy for the other with no MRI on the second although I also could only do therapy because of the cost of followup on the second after my insurance changed Maybe I had bad doctors and therapists but nobody ever told me that exercises would make it worse and everyone really pushed for 30 min to hour of exercise every day to every other day The exercisestherapy before and after my surgery performed both by myself and by professional therapists were very painful And except for a very short time immediately after my surgery the doctor and therapists never said to limit the exercises because of the pain or that the painful exercises were possibly causing harm Although I would recommend some care obviously The exercises you find at reputable sites on the internet are typically the same that I was given to perform Large wide bands rubber are used for most of the exercises for strengthening I havent looked for them in the store but they may be available  start with the least resistance you can get first then work up to stronger bands The exercises should be done slowly in both directions  dont use a band thats so strong you cant control the recoil and you should be able to do ten to fifteen repetitions Other exercises can be done against a wall I am not a doctor or medical professional so I dont have to recommend seeing a doctor Obviously it would be best to do so but I understand that decent health care isnt affordable  even with insurance Have they checked for blockage from the heart just wondering better to waste someones time than your life go see someone  what are fibromyalgia affects could be allergic reaction to a med I fell that people experience anxiety in many different ways In your case one might say that the stress your homework can entail might subsequently trigger a specific chemically cranial process making you experience panic or anxiety due to the situation I would say that anxiety related to school is quite common I personally experience immense anxiety when I have to give presentations for schoolsomewhat a similar situation Hope I could help you out This is my first answer haha get a mammogram ASAP to rule out cancer See your doctor too might be an infection too it could be something called thoracic outlet syndrome basically the nerves that run down your arm into your hands are compressed by either ligaments or tight muscles there are different conditions associated with this such as carpal tunnel etc i am a current massage therapy student we are studying these kinds of conditions also last night an alarm went off so i sat up in bed really fast and hurt my shoulder again the pain has been off and on for the day but for the most part i really dont feel anything  but did it anywaysWorkout on Monday came around my arm shoulder didnt hurt i was actually feeling good and strong lol Anyways i got through my first 10 reps at bench a measly 135lbs my shoulder started to burn thinking nothing of it i continued onto my second set another 10 lbs up at about 8 reps my shoulder actually started to hurt and burn sting all of those type of things On my 3rd set it was again 10 lbs higher got to about 6 before my shoulder wouldnt really take it anymore i know it wasnt the smartest thing to do but i guess i was in denyal that i messed up my shoulder prior to that So i pretty much couldnt work out the rest of the time I did some biceps workouts that didnt hurt my shoulder and some curls that didnt hurt it at all Next day i was told by my nco to go and talk to the medic Probably should have mentioned im currently in the US Army deployed to afganastan So a medic looks at my shoulder doesnt really know too much about it gets the SSG incharge of the aid station to look at it rotates it hears a verbal pop and feels grinding It was tender Day 3 it bearly hurt at all day 4 whenever now is doesnt really hurt at all It feels awkward at times but doesnt hurt i broke my profile they gave me by lifting a saw and other things but it doesnt really seem to hurt they are saying i could have partially torn the rotator cuff or labram but how could it not hurt if i tore something If it was torn wouldnt it take more time than a day or two Also there was a pressure sensitive spot under my shoulder by my armpit that hurt pretty bad to the touch but doesnt hurt anymore either could it just be tendonittis My daughter caught it from her friend 5 yrs ago and it was from putting her slippers on I never caught it tho when I rubbed the ointment on her back where it wasI immediately washed my hands tho too I guess different people affected differently by things I have almost the same thing except i have splotches that are raised and itch all over me but seems to start at the arm I read another place online a similar person had the same thing and their Dr said that it was a new virus strain I have muscle pain and my thighs have changed shape waiting to see a neurologist to see if statins are the cause i have been on simvastatin side effects rosuvastatinside effects pravastatin side effects and fibrates side effects If you have had lyme disease and did not take antibiotics until you were symptom free it will return  I know it happened to me because I could not get treatment I needed because of lack of knowledge from infectious disease doctors  long term lyme disease required IV antibiotics to penetrate the underlying tissues  you need to see a lyme literate doctor who has success in treating lyme disease  wwwiladsorg Here is a great slide show from the site that might help you identify it i have the same problem at times only with pain half way down my arm i am told by ppl with simular problems that this could be a rotator cuff problem hope that helps my mom just asked her doctor this and he said yes I would leave a msg with doctor to call you You can leave info on the msg that you are the sister and you have concerns if the bruising is getting worse you need to go to the doctor and make sure that is not a blood clot and or it could be a busted blood vein which will never go back to normal yes it is normal it could take a week to a week in a half to fill normal agin it just the meds running there course but it will be fine Get checked for a TFCC tear That sounds like what I went through dont waste your time here in sharing it with us as this is issue related with health so just go consul an expert man  deffinately a heating pad It helps me Could be a medicine reaction or poor circulation Ive had this problem for years Ive met young and old alike with this problem The metformin could be the source along with any sleep or anxiety medications taken on the same day There also seems to be a link to the weight loss associated with diabetes and loss of muscle It could be a pinched nerve or possibly some connective tissue damage It is much more likely that the problem is related to your weightlifting injury than lung cancer If you are still lifting weights its probably a good idea to give it a rest and work on stretching and healing mucsle spasm he needs to see a doctor there is something wrong with his blood oxygen levels "}
