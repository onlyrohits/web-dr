{"text": "HAs he been tested for asthma His weight sounds like it may be affecting his daily life  Poor buddy  no kid should not be able to play and run  httpwwwonhealthcomkneepainpage2htmwhatinjuriescancausekneepainandwhataresymptomshowiskneepainwithinjurydiagnosedandtreated I usually jog and do sprint spurts on some run days and other days I jog at a comfortable pace w maybe a faster paced run so intervals basically I am also 147 lbs I dont know how many miles because I dont have a pedometer that displays miles I have a question for you Do you have a hard time sweating or perspiring The purpose of sweating is to keep our bodies from overheating Over the years I have found that since I have a problem sweating my body has no way of releasing the heat and therefore anyone that comes to hug and kiss my cheek always ask me why I feel sooooo hot or like I have a fever when I dont The heat is trapped inside Not being able to sweat is known as Anhidrosis research it and ask your doctor if this could be your issue I have also found that I have an issue with dehydration and when I drink the amount of water needed for my body weight then it helps reduce my inner heat as well as benefits me in other healthy ways Hope this helps An otherwise healthy person who gets the flu will usually improve over two to five days In some people that tired feeling may last for one week or more and very rarely the symptoms can last for several weeks post influenza asthenia A major concern when you get the flu is that complications can arise This is not strictly a relapse but the development of another illness The risk is highest for those with diabetes heart lung or kidney disease and other chronic diseases that lower the bodys resistance to infection Persons over age 65 are also at greater risk of developing complications from the flu A very serious complication associated with the flu is pneumonia Shortness of breath sharp chest pain on deep breathing or fever lasting beyond five days are symptoms that may indicate pneumonia Talk with your doctor if your symptoms are not improving It is always better to wait until you are feeling better before starting back on a vigorous exercise program It is normal to feel weak for several days after the flu but if your symptoms persist seek medical attention to be safe Have you checked if has had a fall somewhere or hurt while playing Please do not ignore and take him to a doctor Hope he gets well soon As a mother do understand how traumatising it can be when kids fall ill Take care Hi Im sorry about your nephew And glad that he has a wonderful aunt I had a neighbour who had a autistic child she too was in denial of the fact that the child needed help She didnt even accept the opinion of her OBGyn who assisted in her childbirth This kid was 3 12 when he wouldnt even utter a word but was humming songs in sync Like wise Austin might have some special skill which you could nurture and approach thro that area for therapy at home It could be that  some people think denial or looking away makes the problem disappear We do know that it might be painful for the mother to hear such a thing about her child Probably you or other family members could take her for counselling first and make her realise that care and cure is available And you all are there to support them Wish you get all help for your little nephew I had preeclampsia with my son All it took was a urine test for them to identify You swell up all over too with it and my face was very swolen when they induced my labor They check the amount of protein in your urine and if you have too much of it they run about two more urine tests where you pee in a bucket thing for 24 hours cause if it goes up so high you have to be induced for the danger it does you and the baby Mine wasnt allowing Sky to gain weight and he was already practicing breathing for labor at 34 weeks They induced me at 35 weeks and he was 4 lbs 2 oz when we left When I had preeclampsia I felt hot all over and dizzy Especially when I showered or stood for very long The point is though is that I was having the symptoms of preeclampsia for months before it came on full force symptoms like yours The best thing that you can do is rest and rest a lot Stress brings it on thats how mine came on so you just need to not worry about it because they check your urine and every time you have an appointment thats one of the things they check for As long as you dont have a high enough protein count in your urine you should be okay When I had Sky mine was so bad I couldnt see him until the next morning at I had him at 413 pm All you can do is take it easy Theyll let you know if you get into the danger zone thats one thing they check for every time you pee in the little cups they give you I really hope this settles your fears Stress brings it on so try and relax for now Hi there My two year old also had that She ended up having to have an inhaler because her airways would inflate when she was active therefore causing her to have trouble breathing After she used the inhaler for a while it went away and now she is a healthy almost 4 year old We only ever used it the one time I would reccomend it good luck I have the same symptoms I feel its closer to the bronchitis side of things because of the clear mucus I cough when I am not riding I am able to comfortably take my heart rate over 160 but I still have a cough which lasts for weeks after an upper respiratory tract infection generally also involving the sinuses I also get the odd drainage from my sinuses afterduring a hot shower for example which seems to clear them Stop exercise to reduce inflamation Once its inflamed it is easier to irritate it and keep it inflamed  I am sorry for the illness of your brotherinlaw I do not know his medical history and I am not a doctor but Ill try to provide you with some information as follows Summary Many times there are no overt symptoms of liver disease during the early stages of liver disease including cirrhosis It is suspected that your brotherinlaw may be in a more advanced stage of liver disease Your brotherinlaw appears to be in an acute stage of liver disease that has resulted in toxin buildup within the body causing stage 3 Hepatic Encephalopathy Hepatic Encephalopathy patients may have a reversal of this condition with efficient and timely medical treatment Unfortunately some Hepatic Encephalopathy patients do not respond to treatment and death may occur I hope that this answer has been helpful and that you and your family remain well during this period of medical uncertainty I would show a respectful and calm concern over my ER visit and its resultant findings Three 3 medical conditions were uncovered as follows ERs can be wonderful in stabilizing patients and coming up with a preliminary diagnosis But unless life threatening situations cannot be resolved most patients are sent back home to followup with their medical professional My suggestion is to see your primary care doctor and report the ER findings Your doctor may want to run more testing prescribe medications or refer you to see a cardiologist Periodically well hear on the news of a basketball player who collapses dead while running down the court Just like you they were supposed to be in excellent physical condition Dont let that happen to you make an appointment to see your doctor sooner rather than later  It surely must be a great challenge to endure 247 symptoms of anxiety and depression The positive parts that I gleam from your question are that you already have a diagnosis and also possess some insight into your mood disorders So at least youre not starting from point zero Yes you should be assessed and reenter treatment It is not unusual for your conditions to go into a state of remission and suddenly erupt with an invigorated vengeance Some individuals actually go through cyclical periods of depression and anxiety like during the fall season when there is less lightThey automatically seek treatment during certain times of the year even before overt symptoms appear It is also common for people who suffer from depression to have anxiety attacks fueled by depression and folks who suffer from bouts of anxiety to also be clinically depressed These two emotional states work in harmony to reap havoc in the lives of those afflicted You deserve to feel well and have a joyful life With talk therapy and medications you can be relieved of this tormenting disorder By seeking treatment as soon as possible your recovery should be swift and your prognosis promising  The false sense of hearing water running without actual environmental stimuli is referred to as an auditory hallucination They can be alarming to the patient and cause the caregiver much distress It is a challenging conundrum that youre in It sounds like youre at the end of your rope The truth is that she is probably also at the end of her rope Your mother may be feeling fear about the sound that she is hearing She may also exhibit signs of frustration and anger when reality is promoted It is important to remember that to your mother the perception that she has of hearing running water then becomes her reality It is difficult to be therapeutic and kind when a loved one is acting irrationally It is fine line that needs to be walked in responding to her expressions of anxiety Here is the trick You should not lie and agree that the water is actually running This will only feed her hallucination and make her wonder why you havent taken action to correct the situation It is also counterproductive to argue with her to make her feel like the sounds are only in her head or that she is senseless A middle ground response on your part might be as follows I know that what youre hearing is upsetting Im working on a plan to help those sounds go away I love you and would never allow anything to harm you Those three sentences said with genuine care and love may offer her some degree of reassurance Delusion disorder manifested by paranoia may also occur with the hallucinations Those statements that youre responsible for the water sounds are not your mothers false perceptions but instead go to her state of mind and reasoning Here are my recommendations Your mother needs to be evaluated professionally for the cause of these hallucinations The causes may include dementia Alzheimers disease medication reactions psychosis and brain tumors Antipsychotic medications may help your mom Treating depression will not help with the hallucinations and delusions Sit calmly comfort her and provide reassurance that you will not allow her to be hurt Do not leave her alone in the house Think about making environmental changes like keeping additional lights on during the night or changing your mothers sleeping location further away from where she hears the noise If she needs to be close to the restroom facilities consider putting a portable commode in her room Take a break as the caregiver Perhaps other family members or friends can periodically take a turn in caring for your mother Investigate daycare for your mom so that you have time to care for your own personal needs This situation can definitely improve with calmness patience and professional intervention I wish you well and admire your commitment to being your mothers caregiver  Phentermine is a central nervous system appetite suppressant It has properties similar to an amphetamine This medication is generally prescribed for a period not to exceed 23 weeks to control weight gain along with diet and exercise Your yoyo results may be a result of taking the medication over a 5 week period You may also be experiencing a counterintuitive sideeffect of having increased hunger At any rate the doctor who prescribed the medication should be contacted You should not attempt to increase decrease or stop phentermine by yourself as serious sideeffects symptoms may occur Here is the positive news During the last 10 years your weight was pretty constant at 150 lbs to 155 lbs Based upon having a medium built along with your sex height and age the range of ideal weight for you should be 126lbs to 154 lbs The suggested mean weight for you is 140 lbs That tells me that you were doing well with your weight prior to becoming injured Here are my suggestions  The diagnosis process used by many doctors is called Differential Diagnosis Essentially a list of the top possible conditions is developed based upon case symptoms and testing results Onebyone these conditions are reduced to just one by the process of elimination I even approach most multiple choice test questions in this fashion I look for all of the incorrect answers until all that is left is the correct answer Based upon the basic information provided in your question I believe that the best choice for your fathers problems is related to his seizure disorder I have personally witnessed at least 100 seizures of varying types intensity and being had by different individuals The two details that you mentioned and swaying my determination to a seizure disorder were your dads obvious seizure history and the 15 minute time frame duration of the weakness dizziness and slurred speech Ministrokes TIAs for example usually last for only seconds to a few minutes seizures better fit the 15 minute duration of for the presenting symptoms The type of seizure that you have described in your question is called Petite Mal These types of seizures usually do not produce any obvious convulsive activity At first blush you may even think that the individual is just zoningout and not paying attention Now that a reasonable differential diagnosis has been developed lets answer your second question regarding whether or not medications are causing the seizures In and by them the answer is probably No Yes medication side effects and interactions can cause your dads symptoms But what is more likely is that the current medications are not adequately controlling the seizures Perhaps his previous medication regime of a year ago was the correct recipe My immediate thought would be to gradually restore the medication activity as it was prescribed a year ago It is a matter of trial and error until optimum dosage titration is achieved In summary 1 I am not a doctor and my answer represents just my best ideas and opinions based upon the data supplied with your question and my health care experience I do not know your fathers complete medical history have not seen testing results or medications being taken and cannot ask questions My answer cannot compare favorably to a hospital and their specialists million dollar types of diagnostic testing conducted and the conclusions of a neurologist With that disclaimer being presented my suggestive thoughts make some sense 2 I would respectfully recommend that you speak to the neurologist about the pros and cons of changing the medications back to what they were a year ago Best wishes for health improvement with your father Ill answer your question directly Yes in order to lose weight most forms of physical exercise prove to be beneficial I need more information your weight miles that you run and running pace used fast slow jogging in order to determine the calories burned during your activity In the meantime here are some useful details relating to exercise activities and calories burned  Based upon being 170 lbs and running 212 miles approximately 278 calories are burned Walking briskly for one 1 mile burns 100 calories Jogging burns 120 calories per mile Swimming burns 100 calories in 20 minutes Biking at an easy pace burns 100 calories in 20 minutes Aerobic exercise to music burns 100 calories in 20 minutes Vigorous gardening burns 100 calories in 30 minutes  Source  Healthy Calculators  All of the above calculations are approximate estimates for calories burned The most common condition that causes anterior knee pain in a runner is patella femoral syndrome Usually there is no need for surgery or medications Physical therapy is the main treatment for this condition If pain persists further work up by your physician and a radiological evaluation may be needed Usually this strain resolves in a few days The simplest treatment for muscle strains are listed below If you are pain free then you can return to running Let pain be your guide The worrisome symptoms for back pain are pain radiating down your leg or numbness pain not responding to over the counter pain medicines and pain with bowel or blader problems Depending on the degree of the injury the time to heal will vary You can start with the following Rest It is important to rest following the injury so it can heal Let pain be your guide on how much activity you can do Stretching Gentle stretching should be helpful but it should not be painful Ice soon after the injury Ice will help calm the inflammatory response and stimulate blood flow to the area This can be done the first 2 days after the injury Usually 20 minutes of icing 3x a day Heat Gentle heating before activity can help loosen the muscle Apply a heat pack prior to stretching or exercising Oral antiinflammatory medications These can help relieve symptoms of pain and also calm the inflammation Physical Therapy If you are still having pain you should see a doctor and you may be referred to physical therapy They can do certain treatments called modalities to help you The most common causes of elevated blood calcium are overfunctioning of small glands called parathyroid glands They are located in the neck  embedded in the thyroid A simple blood test for PTH or parathyroid hormone will help determine if this is the cause Cancer is the second most common cause of elevated calcium Often times these individuals have overt signs of cancer with significant elevations in blood calcium levels However dehydration in someone that is hospitalized can also cause a high calcium and symptoms Other causes include medications vitamins and something called the Milk Alkali Syndrome What would cause a6nyr old to have high calcium at his age PD YES You mention that you have a family history of high cholesterol so you may just have a genetic predisposition to having high triglycerides and high LDL cholesterol That doesnt mean however that you shouldnt try to do everything that you can through modifiable lifestyle behaviors such as diet and exercise to manage your levels Some suggestions to lower your triglycerides and LDL cholesterol levels would be to  Do cardiovascular exercise five times per week for thirty minutes or greater  Lose weight if you are overweight or obese according to BMI  Change dietary habits like reducing saturated and trans fat from your diet cutting out sugar getting more fiber getting more omega3 fatty acids and drinking less alcohol if you drink  Quit smoking if you smoke I really applaud your efforts to avoid getting on cholesterol lowering medication Continue to do what you can with diet and exercise and continue to follow up with your doctor on a regular basis Establishing a good relationship with your doctor is perhaps one of the best things you can do for your health Its important to routinely visit a doctor because some diseases and conditions wont present with outward warning signs or symptoms so the only way to know your risk is to get checked out or tested Its essential that you find a doctor that you can trust and who embodies a similar philosophy regarding health as you Do proper research beforehand Ask friends or coworkers who they would recommend call your insurance company for their guidance or visit the WebMD physician finder found here httpdoctorwebmdcomhomeaspx  that you can use to find doctors near you The WebMD site allow you to pull up a profile of each doctor where it displays information like their education and training to help you make a more informed decision Narrow your decision to a few potential candidates and then try doing internet searches for them to see if you can find reviews that people have written based on their experiences with that doctor Make sure theyre in your network if you have insurance as well Perhaps a good way to get over your distrust of doctors is to play a more active role in your health Ask questions so that youre well informed of what your doctor is doing or why your doctor recommends something Remember its your health and you always have the right to refuse anything if you dont feel comfortable or dont fully understand the reasoning behind it Ask your doctor to allow you time to do more research before making any big decisions as well Dont worry If youre still not happy after visiting your doctor or your experience didnt go well you can always try to find another doctor that better meets your needs Its estimated that 3500 calories is the theoretical amount necessary to lose 1 pound of fat To put this in perspective you will need to create a deficit of 500 calories per day to lose 1 pound per week again theoretically This deficit can come from either eating less expending calories through exercise or a combination of both A healthy weight loss rate is 1 to 2 pounds per week or 10 of your body weight over the course of 6 months A common mistake that people make is to not continually recalculate their calorie needs Keep in mind that as you lose weight you will need to readjust your calorie intake accordingly Do not go below 1200 calories per day however without medical supervision If you hit a plateau and arent seeing weight loss adjust your calorie intake or be more stringent with eating healthier Changes in the gym that can help break through a plateau include  increasing the amount of time you spend per exercise session  increasing the number of days per week you exercise  increasing the intensity level of the exercise  changing the type of exercise altogether Its always best to consult with your doctor or a registered dietitian when making changes to your diet or beginning an exercise routine There are lots of websites and phone apps available to help you calculate your calorie needs and to use for foodexercise journaling though I recommend the Food and Fitness Planner on WebMD available here httpwwwwebmdcomdietfoodfitnessplannerdefaulthtm  Yes different foods cooked in the same oil could result in crosscontamination as traces of the allergenic proteins may be left behind in the oil Crosscontamination can also occur on cutting boards grills and cooking vessels and utensils that are reused without cleaning When eating out at restaurants its important that you be vocal and communicate your allergies with your waiterwaitress so that the cookchef can make the appropriate accommodations when preparing your food Even if you dont think that the food that youre ordering contains any of your allergens its better to have them check before you consume it to avoid further incidents It will be important to mention that you have an allergy regardless so that you can be assured that proper food handling techniques are used and that there will be no crosscontamination I would also suggest keeping a food journal so that you can better identify your triggers and gain a better understanding of your reaction to certain foods In the case of severe anaphylaxis your doctor may equip you with an EpiPen so that youre able to stop allergic reactions fast The first thing to do is to make sure that your husband has medical clearance for exercise before initiating a program after surgery or during his recovery Your husbands doctor or physical therapist should be able to provide example exercises but ACE Fitness also has a pretty comprehensive exercise library with a wide assortment of exercises as well My recommended course of action would be to print out some of these exercises that seem tolerable to him and show them to his doctor or physical therapist to gain his or her approval on those specific exercises Practice caution when initiating an exercise routine so that your husband doesnt aggravate his current condition or cause further injury Slow and gradual progression might be bestVisit the ACE exercise library located here httpwwwacefitnessorgexerciselibrarydefaultaspx The answer depends on many different things since your weight the type of exercise how intense you are doing each exercise and how long you do each exercise will all influence how many calories you burn Simply put however I would say that you have the potential to burn the most calories by running followed by biking and lastly by using the elliptical One way to measure how many calories you burn during exercise is to look at metabolic equivalents METs METs are a way to measure and gauge the amount of energy you burn during physical activity with 1 MET being equal to the energy you burn simply being at rest For instance running at a 10 minute mile pace is roughly the equivalent of 10 METs or ten times the calories you burn at rest Unfortunately there really is no good answer for how many METs you burn while using an elliptical A study entitled 2011 Compendium of Physical Activities A Second Update of Codes and MET Values only lists using an elliptical at a moderate intensity which was the equivalent of 5 METs For comparison bicycling with a moderate effort 12139mph is 8 METs You can find a comprehensive list of METs by doing an internet search for Compendium of Physical Activities Tracking Guide Websites utilizing a formula involving these MET values for each type of exercise along with your weight and the duration can help to estimate how many calories you will burn during exercise Keep in mind that these are just based off of averages but one such site is httpwwwwebmdcomdiethealthtoolfitnesscaloriecounter  Play around with the types of activities and the duration of the activity to see what can provide you with the most calories burned You should always have the final say with what goes on with your health and your body If you believe you have a health condition you did a good thing to express your concerns with your doctor Unfortunately your doctor doesnt seem to be legitimizing or validating your concerns Your doctor may have good reason however to not support your claims Think back to the explanation that your doctor provided for you  is there any possibility that he or she could be right Research online is great but medical advice from a doctor is of course very credible as well Your doctor may have limited exposure to the condition though so maybe you could find a specialist in the area Its important to consider the source of your information Another point to consider is that maybe you didnt express yourself well enough Print out some of the research that youve found and try talking to your doctor about what could be causing some of the specific symptoms In general its also important to consider the test itself too How accurate and reliable is it Is it invasive or are there risks to having it done What are the pros and cons of doing the testing Theres no harm in getting a second opinion Just as different people may have different political views doctors may have differing medical views as well Maybe you can find a different doctor that will better support your views or help you to understand why testing may not be in your best interest Deciding to exercise while youre sick can depend a lot on your illness and your symptoms To be honest the answer to your question often depends on who youre asking since there really doesnt seem to be a clear consensus or agreement I personally feel more often than not that its best to take time to rest and recover from your illness before continuing with exercise My rationale comes from a physiological standpoint Basically exercise can put a lot of stress on your body and your immune system is the only way that your body fights infections and pathogens that make you sick When you exercise youre devoting some of your bodys resources towards recovery from exercise instead of recovery from illness In some instances exercise may even make you sicker or even prolong your illness You also have to consider how comfortable you would feel while exercising with some of your various symptoms Medication may help alleviate some symptoms but otherwise how would you feel trying to go for a run if youre congested or have a persistent cough If you choose to exercise while sick you should consider decreasing your exercise intensity frequency or duration until you fully recover Please be considerate by following proper gym etiquette if you choose to work out in a gym Check out this WebMD article for more input and guidance httpwwwwebmdcomcoldandflufeaturesexercisingwhensick  Running is a great way to expend calories and boost your metabolism to promote weight loss However I would recommend slowly and gradually building up your exercise routine to jogging Start out by walking and then gradually add more days per week or time per session You can also try walking with intermittent bouts of jogging Eventually you can build up to where you are doing mostly jogging instead of walking From there you can work on increasing how long you jog or your speed while jogging A couch to 5K program might provide good direction on how to gradually transition from walking to jogging Its important to start a routine in this slow and gradual fashion to allow your body time to acclimate and adjust to your exercise routine and to avoid any injury If you are considerably overweight it might be best to refrain from jogging altogether until you lose weight The extra weight can put a high demand on your joints while jogging since it is more of a high impact exercise There are many modifiable lifestyle behaviors as well as suggested complementary and alternative treatments for high blood pressure Here are some Diet Learn more about the DASH diet an eating plan that has been shown to help lower blood pressure in as little as two weeks for some people Review the entire eating plan but make sure you decrease sodium and increase potassium magnesium and calcium Exercise Concentrate on getting enough cardiovascular exercise a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise per week The more exercise the better however Weight In general losing weight if youre overweight or obese can help to lower blood pressure Most likely you would achieve this through diet and exercise Stress Management and Relaxation Try Yoga Tai Chi or deep breathing exercises to help you relax and manage stress which can help to lower blood pressure Supplements and Natural Remedies With your doctors permission explore supplements like Coenzyme Q10 Omega3 fatty acids or amino acids Although there isnt much research remedies like garlic and hawthorn may be effective in lowering blood pressure too Its important to talk with your doctor before taking any supplements herbal therapies or alternative medicine Alternative Therapies Acupuncture autogenic training or biofeedback are alternative therapies that are thought to perhaps help manage blood pressure that you could research more about as well Discuss these with your doctor or another trained health professional Some of these different methods may have varying degrees of success while others simply dont have enough research to validate their claims You will need to do additional research and discuss things further with your doctor You may simply have a genetic predisposition to high blood pressure but it may be worth it for you to research additional methods besides medication to you help manage it Please visit this WebMD article for more information Remember to replace your running shoes every 300400 miles or every 6 months Many running related injuries are due to worn out footwear Achilles tendon which is located on the back of your leg and foot or is the pain actually at the bottom of your heel Given your comments your problem could be a condition called plantar fasciitis Typically this condition is at the bottom of the foot heel region It can also be closer to the Achilles and you can experience pain slightly higher on the back of the heel near the Achilles Heres one article on tendinitis

answer is this Not until youre released to do so by your surgeon Every person heals differently Some people bleed more easily than others for example Only your surgeon can tell you when its OK to return to normal activities As a plastic surgery nurse I worked with many people who wanted to get back to physical activity quickly after surgery and I always told them the same thing A little patience now means you wont have complications later You dont want to rush into activities like weightlifting that could ruin your surgery and require you to have another procedure Heres some general information from WebMD about that you might find helpful Best wishes to you Im sure youll be back to running and lifting in no time Im sorry to hear youre experiencing this As a veteran of skin rashes I can relate This is probably not an emergency room situation Save the ER for those times when you experience chest pain or difficulty breathing A scaly itchy rash on the face can be caused by many things including eczema a likely culprit and psoriasis The only way to tell for sure is to get a physical exam from your primary care provider If the diagnosis is eczema or psoriasis your PCP will be able to tell you how to treat it Id be cautious using Caladryl calamine lotion near the eyes If it gets in your eyes it can cause irritation If you have no known drug allergies you may apply some overthecounter hydrocortisone cream temporarily until you can see your doctor Keep in mind though you want the rash to be visible when you visit your health care provider So take some good photos of it before you use any treatments Best to you Usually when we talk about a blood clot in the leg were referring to a DVT This is a blood clot deep in the leg usually but not always in the calf muscle that can cause complications such as a pulmonary embolism or stroke Part of the reason why a DVT is scary is because we cant see it Only after it begins causing problems do we notice its presence a red swollen lower leg What youre describing sounds more like a  These veins lie close to the surface of the skin and are easily visible Varicose veins have a ropey appearance and can be painful and cause swelling of the leg or foot Interestingly on rare occasion a varicose vein can actually be a sign of a DVT For this reason and because the vein is causing you discomfort it would be a good idea to have this checked out by your primary care provider Best wishes to you Im sorry to hear youre going through this It sounds to me like your loved one does have a problem with alcohol I base this assessment not on the amount consumed but the fact that he seems to require alcohol consumption every day and also the fact he sneaks alcohol and tries to hide his consumption from you Of course the fact your family doctor believes your partner has a problem with alcohol is enough evidence for me Unfortunately you cannot control what your partner does or how he views his  The only thing you can do is ensure the safety of yourself and your children I suggest you look into AlAnon which is the family group of Alcoholics Anonymous This group can give you support and guidance in dealing with your loved ones presumed alcoholism The fact your partner has not physically harmed you is irrelevant The wideranging negative effects of alcoholism on children is welldocumented You should seek treatment in order to equip yourself to help your children Trust me they will feel the effects of their fathers alcoholism later in life Again Im sorry youre dealing with this Alcohol abuse is very common in society but that doesnt mean you have to accept it You can seek help for yourself and your children Your partner may or may not choose to seek help at some point Wishing you all the best My advice Go back to your doctor Sure heart problems are rare in someone your age and at your level of fitness But that doesnt mean this doesnt warrant further investigation When you return to the doctor be prepared to ask these questions What could be causing such severe pain because 85 out of 10 is severe on any scale What diagnostic tests are available to me Should I see a cardiologist Could this be sickle cell disease  May I get a complete metabolic panel just to make sure theres nothing weird going on Whats the worstcase scenario Whats the bestcase scenario Sometimes just knowing the questions to ask is helpful If you arent satisfied with the answers your pediatrician gives you such as I dont know whats causing that feel free to consult another health care provider You deserve answers to your questions You have legitimate symptoms I wish you all the best Im sorry to hear youre going through this It sounds very distressing Unfortunately the only way to diagnose whats causing this problem is by physical examination I suggest you consult your primary health care provider to discuss your symptoms and have some testing done A number of conditions can cause the symptoms you describe so please dont jump to any dire conclusions until you see a medical professional Take care Well your symptoms certainly warrant a checkup What youre describing could be something as benign nonlife threatening as a cyst or something more serious The fact youve had pain and swelling in the area plus a fever could point more to an infectious process than to something like cancer but only a physical examination by a medical professional can say for sure And either way this lump seems to need treatment Id suggest you make an appointment with your primary health care provider as soon as possible to get this lump looked at Wishing you all the best Im so sorry youre going through this Back pain isnt fun and its nothing to fool around with When a Marine or former Marine tell me he has barely controlled back pain this tells me he needs to see a doctor Many back conditions could cause the symptoms youre describing from a displaced disk to a cracked vertebra The only way to find out for sure whats going on is to get a physical examination and some testing like Xrays or MRI done Back problems rarely get better on their own so the sooner you get this treated the better I wish you all the best with this Sorry to hear of this Dealing with a constantly runny nose can be very annoying The medical term for a runny nose is  The runnyness is caused by inflammation of the nasal tissue The most common type of rhinitis is allergic rhinitis However its possible to have the nonallergic variety too Another flavor of rhinitis is called gustatory rhinitis and this refers to getting a runny nose when you eat Other things can cause a runny nose such as exposure to cold weather If youve never been diagnosed with nasal allergies this would be a good time to see your health care provider to determine if your runny nose is caused by allergies or not If it is an overthecounter or prescription medication may help dry up your nasal tissue If your runny nose is not caused by allergies then your only option may be to invest in a lot of tissue Not the best news I know Hope this helps Im sorry youre going through this Pain issues can negatively impact a persons quality of life and in your case youve had to reduce your running because of it If its been a year since you last saw the doctor about this its time to go back For one thing you now have additional symptoms in the knee and heel For another thing even if the pain were confined to your hip the fact it has not gotten better over the course of a year means you deserve to have it rechecked Many conditions can cause the pains youve described Anything from to worn cartilage in the joints to could be the culprit If you dont feel your doctor did an adequate job in diagnosing your condition feel free to get another opinion I wish you all the best Im sorry to hear this and hope youre under a doctors care Im assuming you are since you mention PVCs One thing that can cause a drop in blood pressure is taking too high a dose of blood pressure medication As with most medications antihypertensives need to be evaluated over time to make sure the dosage is still correct Sometimes as we age we need a lower dosage of medications in general simply due to our aging machinery The liver and kidneys may not process metabolize drugs as thoroughly as we get older for example However you should never adjust your own blood pressure medication dosage Only make adjustments when instructed to do so by a doctor Your heart issues also could cause your blood pressure to drop Whenever the heart isnt pumping correctly it can affect the pressure in the veins and arteries In effect when the ventricles contract prematurely PVCs it means theyre out of sync Theyre not pushing as much blood into your system as they should Thus your blood pressure may be reduced You should check with your doctor about how to handle the low blood pressure issue The situation can be handled in multiple ways and only your cardiologist can advise you how to proceed Wishing you well Im sorry youre going through this and that its concerning you The skin is an amazing organ One thing it does is function as sort of a radiator for the body in the sense that blood vessels in the skins surface become enlarged to release heat when the core of the body gets too warm This engorgement of the blood vessels in the skin can cause flushing a red appearance and may make the skin feel hot The body releases excess heat this way in order to avoid overheating the core I guess my question would be why is your body getting so hot at midday Is it because youre exercising for example Are you going through menopause and experiencing hot flashes Or do you just get unbearably hot at the same time every day Our body temperature tends to fluctuate throughout the day but if youre getting uncomfortably hot every day at the same time with no known cause it would be worth discussing this with your doctor at your next visit I mean it sounds as if your body is functioning normally your core gets hot so your skin releases the heat but perhaps theres some underlying cause for this that should be checked out I wish you all the best with this To answer your primary question in the back do not lead to cancer Theres no relationship I know of between disc disease and any type of cancer So at least you can set your mind at ease about that Im sorry youre having pain though You deserve to have your pain treated Please make an appointment with your primary care provider to discuss your pain and hopefully leave with a treatment plan If your primary care provider doesnt prefer to treat chronic pain he or she may refer you a pain specialist Physical therapy also might be helpful I wish you all the best with this Im sorry youve been going through this and want to tell you youve suffered long enough Its time to get you some help The behavior youre describing can be caused by a few different things Id suggest you begin by seeing your primary health care provider to rule out any sort of neurological problem If you get a clean bill of health then Id suggest you see a counselor or psychotherapist Many people cope with stress by hitting or cutting themselves so please do not feel embarrassed to seek help for this problem Sometimes the issue can be solved with just a few visits to a therapist Other times it may take a bit longer You dont deserve the abuse youre experiencing You deserve relief from this behavior I urge you to seek attention for this Be well Good for you for persevering Navigating the health care system can be daunting but you are hanging in there until you get some answers Obviously I cant diagnose whats going on with you and frankly wouldnt hazard a guess at this point Its possible all of your symptoms are related but its equally possible theyre all coincidental Or related to something else entirely Some conditions literally take years to reveal themselves enough for diagnosis Some examples but I want to make clear I am NOT suggesting any of these apply to you lupus gastroparesis fibromyalgia This process could be what youre experiencing If all of your symptoms are related to a single disorder perhaps that disorder is manifesting itself very slowly By not giving up and continuing to seek care for your ailments you may be helping yourself down to the road to diagnosis I wish you all the best in finding out what is causing these perplexing problems The medical term for high calcium levels in the blood is hypercalcemia I note this so you may more thoroughly research it if you wish Hypercalcemia can be caused by several things The most common cause is hyperparathyroidism The parathyroid glands are small glands near the larger thyroid gland The parathyroid glands produce a hormone PTH that stimulates calcium production When these glands produce too much PTH it can cause an overabundance of calcium in the blood Other conditions also can cause high calcium levels in the blood which is why your mothers health care team is running a variety of tests They want to pinpoint the cause and then come up with a treatment plan to get those calcium levels back to normal I wish you and your mother all the best in getting this situation resolved Because you are symptomatic you have a headache you should not wait another week to see your doctor That said you probably do not need to rush to the emergency room either What you need to do is call your doctors office and tell them your blood pressure has been running high and you have a severe headache I can assure you your doctor wants to know this He or she may call you back with instructions for increasing your medication At the very least your providers office will advise you what to do in terms of bringing you to the office or telling you to seek emergency medical attention Remember however ultimately are in control of your health decisions If you truly feel this is an emergency situation you should take action Wishing you well Im sorry youre going through this I can certainly understand your wanting a more permanent solution to the problem after dealing with the support hose for five years Certainly there are to treat  Im not sure why your health care provider didnt recommend any of them when you were first diagnosed After five years you may feel free to return to your provider and ask about more permanent options for your condition There may be a very good reason why you werent offered surgery to begin with Maybe it wasnt feasible for some reason But surgical techniques change and patients change Maybe today youre a better candidate for surgery than you were five years ago The only way to find out is to see a medical professional You can start with your primary care provider or go directly to a physician who specializes in varicose vein treatments Hope this helps Wouldnt it be great if we could tell our body when to start and stop menstruating I think it would be terrific Unfortunately its not the case Theres no way to prompt your uterus to begin shedding its lining Because each womans menstrual cycle usually varies slightly maybe youll get lucky and start early If you feel uncomfortable during that time of the month and youre not allergic to any medications you can try some of the overthecounter preparations for menstrual pain and discomfort While a health care provider might be able to prescribe something stronger for diagnosed PMS premenstrual syndrome its obviously too late to get an exam diagnosis and prescription before your anniversary in a week or so I wish I had better news but look on the bright side Your periods are regular which a lot of women are sure to envy you for and you apparently have a great marriage Happy anniversary That kind of weird isnt it Unfortunately only a physical examination can help figure out what those marks are From your description they almost sound like stretch marks but the shin would be a very odd place to find stretch marks Id suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider to get them looked at I dont think theyre the hallmark of anything serious but Im not a doctor A physician nurse practitioner or physician assistant might see these marks as a sign of some other condition Thats why Im suggesting you see a doctor This isnt an emergency situation but its worth getting checked out I realize this answer is unsatisfying but I hope you find it helpful  Hello friends I had similar problem since almost 10 years I am M30 years now My normal body temperature when I was not feeling feverish would be about 968 F almost 2 degree Fahrenheit lesser than normal When I am feeling feverish the temperature would rise to about 97ish rarely reaching 98 No doctor would agree that i have fever since it doesnt show up on thermometer However strangely my skin is very hot to touch and even normal person could feel that but interior body temperature is not I would feel feverish with chills I would have episodes of feverish feeling every 2 months or so and every time it would last for a 23 weeks Doctor would prescribe some antibiotics and do some tests but they were not helpful I do not have Thyroid or any other deficiency however I have been recently diagnosed with Celiac disease as well The reason I write this time is because something miraculous happened this and I would want others opinion if it helps relieve your symptoms as well This might very well be a cure Treatment Day1 Take 500mg Paracetamol After 30 mins take Vitamin C  Zinc supplement Day2 Continue Vitamin C Zinc daily for next few days I got fantastic relief on day 2 onwards and no longer feel hot and my temperature is back to 969ish J Waiting for your inputs and wishing a speedy recovery I would go see Dr if I was you What about hydrohydrosis I dont know why but almost everyone in my Mothers family including my brothers and I normal body temperature is well below 986 degrees In fact Ive had temps of 966 taken in the hospital on a regular basis I had an extremely high metabolic rate and was an athlete competing in martial arts I had to gain weight to compete with stronger opponents in a heavier weight class Lets keep it simple 3 key elements will allow you to gain muscle massweight 1 Rest  Get two daysweek of rest to recover from training You grow when youre resting You can split up the 2 days or have it simultaneously Take it easy on those days and dont do anything too physical 2 Train  Lift heavy weights with low reps for 1 12 hour and then do another 30 min of plyometrics Next day do it in reverse Repeat this cycle throughout the week If youre an athlete youll need to extend training time up to 3 hrs in one day When running do sprints Do high impact high intensity exericises Do not perform longdistance endurance training If you have to run dont go over 3 miles 3 Eat  Consume a lot of carbs from veggies and fruits 34 of your meal should be carbs to give you energy and pack on necessary fat 14 of your meal should be protein to build muscle Contrary to popular beliefs you need plenty of fat storage in order for the body to be healthy and build muscle Consuming protein volume based on your body weight is not accurate for everyone some bodies will not utilize extra protein You want that carb for energy to push harder and grow biggerstronger Eat pasta rice and potatos with every meal You will bulk up in sizestrength adding 10 lbs of muscle like me within a month If you get too bulky and need to trim down to make weight for athletic competition then reverse the diet eat more protein and less carbs Always drink a ton of water Find people with similar goals to train with Its not just about building your body its also about building a community Good luck Maybe you are running in a way that makes your foot hurt Id go to a running shop and get the right shoes for your gait Or maybe consider going to an orthopedic doctor to get things checked out you might need to be referred by your GP Dont be worried be happy It means you really are losing weight and getting your body in shape It will probably return to a semi normal period after a significant amount of time has passed with your new regiment Significant weight loss big changes in physical activity all impact your period and make it lighter shorter and overall more bearable It probably has something to do with the hormonesendorphies released when exercising I dont really know the chemical part of it but this a normal occurrence Its also why women who are really active often times have to slow down in order to get pregnant so their body returns to normal functioning and they start ovulating regularly again But please do NOT take running as birth control Definitely not the message here  Yes some women do experience spotting with heavy exercise This can represent either a less stable lining of the uterus or polypsfibroids Lets look at both possibilities An unstable lining of the uterus can arise from hormonal forms of birth control eg pillspatchringshot It can also happen if the woman has an overly thickened uterine lining A toothick lining can develop if the woman is missing ovulations is perimenopausal andor is very heavy set Classically a too thick lining will also suggest itself if there are erratic or very heavy menstrual periods The presence of uterine fibroids or polyps of the uterine lining can also make a normal sized lining be easier to have spotting Classically there may be spotting between periods or after intercourse Bottom line if the spotting persists or increases you should see your GYN or local family planning clinic for follow up There is no overt reason for you to stop your planned runningunless it prompts increased bleeding An antibiotic will not help the cough it is only for infection However the cough after an illness is usually the longest symptom you have and can last some time If it becomes worse or prolongs more than a month I would ask the MD Also perhaps they should give him something specific for the cough Coughing is always worse at night and if could mean a better nights rest for him if he can not cough so much at night Also often a cough is actually good for getting rid of the junk that is in his lungs so he needs to cough some of it up and out I wouldnt worry too much at this point I would suggest you visit this site  How To Get RippedThere you can find a customized nutrition and weight training plan based on details you fill in Like age weight height metabolism and body type You can also read my story it contains information about my struggle Meybe you will find it heplful Good Luck This is exactly what happens in a condition recognized by Chinese medicine call Empty Heat or Empty Fire The clinical manifestations of Empty Heat in general irrespective of organ are  a feeling of heat in the afternoonevening  a dry mouth with desire to drink in small sips  malar flush red cheekbones  a dry throat at night  a feeling of heat in the chest and palms and soles also called A5palm heat  dry stools  scantydark urine  a FloatingEmpty and Rapid pulse  a red tongue without coating httpmaciociaonlineblogspotcom201206emptyheathtml Applying cold to the outside like air conditioning will only keep the internal heat inside of your body see the url above for more information Western Medicine does not yet understand this pattern of symptoms I would recommend seeing a competent Traditional Chinese Medical Doctor in your area preferably  a Traditional Chinese Medical doctor The difference can be more that 5 years of study and clinical education As a followup my thyroid tests have all come back find Im scheduled to visit an endocrinologist in two weeks and think that maybe another hormone imbalance may be to blame for all of my symptoms which include  Hair loss all over for about ten years but mostly on the top of my head said to be female pattern baldness which I dont buy Migraines have had for twenty years Knee pain in my right knee MRI shows nothing was told Im just chubby and getting older A fleshyfeeling lump in my throat barium test showed nothing Several yeast infections in the past year plus a UTI Blurred vision at times Trouble concentrating Trouble losing weight I went from doing nothing to exercising five hours a week and lost only 3 pounds in six weeks Anxiety attacks worse recently but have had them for about 10 years More recently in the past couple of weeks Ive been now noticing  Itchy skin mostly at night in the scalp back feet arms legs and groin pretty unbearable Heart palpitations Hand tremors Lightheadednessdizziness mostly after standing but not always Ive had so many tests but the only hormone tests Ive had are for my thyroid all of which came back normal Im a 35yearold woman and have had one pregnancy and hope to have another one once I figure this all out These things are really consuming my life and I really feel as though the doctors are trying to play everything off as coincidence but I just know theres something wrong If anyone has any advice or ideas on what might be going on I would greatly appreciate the comments Im just at the end of my rope and dont know where to go from here if the endocrinologist doesnt find anything Please help Jackie Ask your Drfor an AntiAnxity drug such as Xanax etc it will help Instantly That actually could be normal But one of the questions I have for this particular patient is whether or not theyre using the spray the right way With many of the sprays its important that you follow the directions that are included in the packaging and that you tilt your head the right way Sometimes if the head is tilted too forward its gonna run out The other thing is too is that maybe their nasal tissue is actually irritated A lot of people dont realize that constant use of sprays and topical products can make the tissue a little sensitive and that might be the reason why theyre getting the runny nose So it might be time for a little bit of a break let the tissue heal a little bit and then we can possibly restart therapy But once again its really important that they let you know their pharmacist know about this is whats going on because we may be able to say to them Yes this is a common side effect and Lets go over your technique again or the pharmacist might say You know what Its time to go back to your doctor or healthcare provider to revisit it and lets see if theres something else that could be given When I hear about situations like this I think why didnt you talk to your pharmacist For some medications especially Plavix we can give you a few pills to hold you over until we can get a new prescription from the doctor or health care provider I always tell my patients to look at their medications and dont wait to call in when you dont have any pills especially on a Friday or a holiday weekend Be proactive and get to know your pharmacist we may be able to help you in ways you didnt know Hi I would speak to my dr about the side effect of RLS and anti depressants It could be possible Try a daily dose of folic acid for your RLS that does work Also see if you can get your hubby to massage your legs and feet before bed time Hope this helps Its unlikely your insurance plan will cover the cost of the same prescription in two places within the same general time frame If you have some other type of pharmacy discount card however you may use that to pay for one of the prescriptions as long as it isnt at all connected with your insurance plan But its always best to check with your insurance policy to confirm the specific rules of your plan You could have a Meniscus TearInflammation This happened to me a while back My treatment was cortisone shots every couple of weeks until the inflammation died down If it is very painful and chronic you can get an operation to fix it this is assuming that is the issue Acetaminophen and ibuprofen are the two best overthecounter fever relievers You should check with your pharmacist to determine the proper dose for the patient Also keep in mind that most fevers occur due to some sort of infection So it is usually recommended that you see your doctor if you are running a fever The proper dose of ibuprofen for your son based on his age and weight is 200 mg Therefore it would be fine to give him one 200 mg tablet every six to eight hours as needed for his fever I here this a great deal at the school I teach at If you really want to gain some weight you need to develop a comprehensive nutrition and exercise plan First keep a food diary for three days Are you really eating as much as you think When counseling athletes at school I generally recommend they consume 1820 grams of protein a day per kilogram of body weight So for you at 150 lbs  68 kilograms that would put your protein needs in the range of 122 136 grams a day Now that you know what your eating and how much protein you need Develop an eating plan Heres an example Breakfast 1 large egg scrambled 1 cup old fashioned oat with one tablespoon honey 1 banana 1 cup skim milk Protein in meal  20 grams Lunch 2 grilled chicken breasts 8 ounces 2 cups of veggies broccoli green beans califlower 1 apple 1 serving greek yogurt Protein in meal  69 grams Dinner 1 servings baked pork tenderloin 3 ounces remove all fat 2 cups of veggies 1 banana 12 cup fat free cottage cheese Protein in meal  38 grams Snacks 1 apple with 2 tablespoons of peanut butter protein 7 grams 14 cup sunflower seed string cheese fruit protein 12 grams Total Protein for the day  147 grams Notice theres no junk food chips soft drinks etc or any expensive supplements just good solid nutritional foods Regarding exercise the best way to add weight is by adding muscle To do this you need a well thought out strength training plan Follow the link pasted below to find a great beginners workout on webMD As you advance you can find some additional info here Like I said earlier the key to healthy weight gain is with a comprehensive nutrition and exercise plan both of which you can find here at webMD To be on the safe side be sure to check with your physician before starting Im sorry our little one is going through this The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends keeping children off solid food for the first 24 hours after vomiting To ensure enough fluids have her sip water drink electrolyte replacement drinks like Pedialyte sip on broth and suck on popsicles You want to slowly work back to her regular diet If things dont improve call her pediatrician The best thing to do is work with your healthcare provider about how to get your iron levels back up right now In addition to supplementation increasing dietary iron is important in the long run to keep this problem from recurring Here are ways to increase iron and iron absorption in your diet Iron from animal foods are better absorbed than plant sources so make a point to include those items you like such as chicken and fish Add plant sources of iron to your diet including cereals fortified with iron beanslegumes soy beans tofu pumpkinsquash seeds spinach raisins broccoli and bread To increase their absorption add vitamin C sources such as orange juice tomatoes broccoli and strawberries Examples include vitaminC rich fruit topped on your cereal or beans cooked in a tomatobased sauce Include animal sources of iron with vegetable sources also increases the amount of iron absorbed eg meat chili or beans as a side dish with chicken For more ideas on ironrich food

consuming regular meals with all the food groups and a carbrich snack before your practices for energy See this article for more on what to eat before during and after exercise With some detective work you will discover why your body is not getting into the shape the way it typically does Listen to it its trying to tell you something Good luck The goal should not be to lower your metabolism but to start feeding yourself better and reap the benefits of activity which can result in muscle gain It doesnt matter if you get adequate protein if you are missing out on other important nonprotein calories and nutrients Thats because inadequate carbohydrate and fat intake total calories means protein is used for energy instead of for muscle formation Exercising more can increase your appetite and weight training can gradually help you put on muscle It may take time to see results but because muscle weighs more than fat you are likely to gain weight Here are some tips Eat regular meals and snacks every day Try to plan your meals ahead of time and have items you can put together for quick and healthy meals Gradually build a list of balanced meals you can make for yourself Include 35 food groups at meals including a whole grain lean protein fruits vegetables dairy and healthy fats For example in the morning you might have a big bowl of oatmeal topped with fruit and nuts and a side boiled egg Include 23 food groups at snack time which may consist of cheese and whole grain crackers or an apple with peanut butter or half a meat sandwich with veggie sticks Gradually increase exercise to include cardiovascular exercise and resistance training For tips on how to exercise to build muscle see this article What you may discover during this process is how much better you feel

not recommended that children under two consume rice milk or other alternatives to milk or soy unless directed by a pediatrician or pediatric dietitian The problem are these products are not designed to meet babys needs and they low in fat protein and other key nutrients like iron The simple thing to do is get out there and jog or run for five to 10 minutes Pace yourself slow down if you get out of breath and keep moving One method for beginners is a fiveminute out fiveminute back plan From your starting point jog five minutes turn around and jog back five minutes Done Of course not everyone can jog for 10 minutes to start and thats okay Try an informal intervaltraining method as a way to get started if jogging straight for 10 minutes is beyond your ability Keep in mind that the most important thing is just to get started You can always add more later on Heres an interval plan that will get you started If you stick with this method youll find over time that you can increase the jogging intervals and decrease the walking intervals until you can jog for the entire 30 minutes Formal training schedules If you prefer a more formal training program you can organize your workout into specific intervals or ratios of work to active recovery for example workactive recovery For instance if you can jog for 30 minutes at 55 mph try jogging for three minutes at that speed then increase the speed to 60 mph and jog for one minute then jog again for three minutes at your normal speed then jog again at 60 mph for one minute and so on until you reach your time limit The workactiverecovery ratio in this example is 13 You can increase the work portion each week by 30 seconds and decrease the activerecovery time by 30 seconds and if you follow that plan weekly you will be jogging your whole workout at the faster speed before you know it You can get even more specific and use your heart rate to determine your intervals Heart rate is an excellent indication of how hard you are working For example if your heart rate at 55 mph is 70 of your predicted maximum then start at that speed and increase either the speed andor elevation if youre on a treadmill so that your heart rate increases to 85 for one minute then back to your jogging speed that causes your heart to be at 70 of maximum for three minutes 13 ratio like the example above Over time your conditioning will improve and then your heart rate will be lower at the higher speeds and you can spend more time at the higher speeds and less time in the active rest period You can always vary the ratios if they turn out to be too hard or too easy A good starting ratio is 13 Stretching Although there is no persuasive research to show that stretching will prevent injuries it does feel good and that may be reason enough to stretch Go ahead and stretch your calves quadriceps hamstrings and low back before and after your runs and see what you think Where to run The good news is that you can run just about anywhere Find a track or a trail in the woods or a route on the street near where you live Running in another city when youre traveling is a great way to see new sites and check out your environment You can also call the local running club in the location youre traveling to for tips on scenic places to run You might also consider joining your own local running club The camaraderie of running with others is nice it can be fun motivating and can help you stick with it if youre struggling a bit Its also good to be a club member if youre looking for a training partner Road races You might be interested in running in organized races If so check with your local running club for a race schedule near where you live Road races are a great way to stay motivated monitor your progress and collect cool Tshirts as a trophy for your success Road races come in many distances There are 32 mile a 5K where K means kilometer 50 mile and 62 mile races 10K as well as half marathons 131 miles and marathons 262 miles Most beginners should start with shorter races to get the feel of it and then tackle the longer ones How fast do I run You can determine your pace per mile by using a pace calculator Many Web sites have them  Running certainly does burn lots of calories and if youre running regularly you might decide not to eat as much figuring why do it if youre putting all that energy into running But even if you ran a marathon every day you wouldnt lose weight unless you consumed fewer calories than you burned The bottom line to losing weight is burning more calories than you consume no matter how much exercise you do Running will burn more calories than the elliptical although its pretty close about 100 calories per hour difference Some of the difference is due to the pounding of running and the fact that you propel your body through the air so that both feet are off the ground simultaneously This kind of movement takes lots of energy Both the elliptical and running burn substantially more calories than the bike at the same level of perceived exertion about 200240 calories per hour more In a classic study comparing energy expenditure of exercise machines the order of calories burned from highest to lowest is posted below The elliptical was not studied in this research but it would fit between rowing and crosscountry skiing It should be noted that rowing the elliptical and crosscountry skiing are all very close in calorie expenditure with probably not more than 100125 calories per hour difference among them Treadmill walkingrunning Stair stepping Rowing Crosscountry skiing Biking stationary Now this is not to say that exercises that burn the fewest calories are all bad To the contrary you can get a great workout and burn lots of calories doing any of them Youd be hard pressed to say that Lance Armstrong isnt fit Hes one of the fittest human beings alive and he did it by biking The point is that if you work hard enough on any of the exercise machines and you work up a sweat and you get your heart rate into your training zone then your heart lungs and muscles arent going to know the difference Bottom line is that youll get fit and healthy using any of the machines if you use them consistently and with sufficient intensity One final note There is error in estimating energy expenditure on most if not all exercise machines In some cases it can be as high as 25 percent the machine overestimates how many calories you burn There are simply too many variables for the machine to give you an accurate number and so you need to keep that in mind during weightloss efforts if you are calculating how many calories to eat based on your energy expenditure  It may be pressure buildup in your ears which can happen from allergies You could try an overthecounter allergy treatment  something with a decongestant if you have no heart problems and your blood pressure is fine make sure to read the label to make sure the medication is OK for you  for a few days and see if that helps If not you should check with your doctor as you dont want to ignore hearing loss A standard miscarriage no matter blood type is

the scrotum more than usual If a testis twists around the spermatic cord has to twist around too as it is fixed higher up If this happens the blood flow to the testis is blocked in the twisted spermatic cord This is like a hosepipe attached to a tap The water will not flow if the hose gets twisted on itself A testis with its blood supply cut off is likely to become damaged and die unless the blood flow is quickly restored I think it would best to see your doctor either way being its the above or something else Do hope this helps you Good Luck Hi This numbness is the same as tingling

Hi your Mirena IUD is a progesterone based device for BC so see below Stimulates Growth and Development Estrogen is the primary hormone that stimulates breast growth during puberty but progesterone is required to convert the female breast into a milkproducing organ Dr Carol Lange reports in the article in Steroids that progesterone along with other hormones stimulates development of the mammary glands in the breast So thats why your now a DD If your happy Just enjoy Good Luck As men grow older their testosterone levels slowly decline which could be a reason First things first talk to him about it Regardless of whether you think you developed it after childhood or not if you think you have ADDADHD the first thing you should do is setup an appointment with a psychologist and they will take you through a test to see if you have it what form ADDADHD and to what level you have it Then they will give you a test result report and you should set up an appointment with your primary care physician and talk to them about which type of medication you need and what doseage you should be taking daily You might need to try a couple of different types before you find the right fit that suits your lifestyle Since all medications for ADDADHD are controlled substances and highly abused by many users you will have to see your doctor regularly for check ups to make sure you are not abusing the prescription You also cannot have this medication called into a pharmacy you will have to call your doctor each month to write a new prescription and pick it up in person from the doctors office then take it to get filled at the pharmacy Its definitely a process but if it helps you improve your grades and your study habits then it will all be worth it in the long term If I were you Id get my ear examined by an ENT specialist I had a problem in my ear in the past and visited a general physician who cleaned my ear  gave me some antibiotics advised me to visit an ENT specialist if the problem persists The problem persisted and I visited ENT specialist and was treated for the problem which was cured in 4 weeks maybe you have scabies or the shingles virus My normal temp is 974 and I have always considered that I have more of a fever at say 1022 than a person whose temperature tends to run 986  because its more of a difference However Ive had little luck in getting people in the medical profession to take that seriously because the myth still seems so pervasive that EVERYBODYS normal is 986 though it has long since been proven that that isnt true The important thing is that YOU know you have a high fever I hope youre taking care of whatever is causing it I was running a terrible fever last week and could not get in to see the doctor until tomorrow morning better late than never If you have a virus bed rest fluids and palliative remedies should help if you have a bacterial infection your doctor may want to prescribe an antibiotic depending on what you have Of course antibiotics dont help viruses Whatever you do dont try to be a hero while sick and keep plodding on through work and duties not only will you harm your health and put yourself at risk you will infect everyone else around you Resting while sick isnt selfindulgent even though our crazy culture says it is its common sense Youll get better much faster too Feel Better Your doctor may either need to up the dosage of your bp med or try another one all together Make sure you take you med regularly and around the same time of day I take mine in the am good luck Any contact with a food you are allergic to can cause an allergic reaction Best advice if youre allergic to shellfish NEVER eat somewhere that serves it Lobster is a shellfish and peanuts are in Snickers Stay far away from things

other issues Jock itch is also called tinea cruris This is a yeast infection and yeast loves the warm dark and moist environement sweating common in the groin area Cotton is a natural fiber and tends to breathe better than most synthetics but some synethetic are outstanding when it comes to air circulation I have no problem with cotton or those special quickdry synethetics but not all underwear is created equal Boxers allow my air than tighty whities assuming we are just talking about men Diarrhea is not a symptom that is consistent with influenza Influenza is a respiratory disease with fever yes it can be as high as 103 and coughing body aches chills etc If your daughter is having severe diarrhea influenza is not the cause and a flu vaccine would not have prevented this gastroenteritis She most definitely picked up a pathogen of some sort usually a virus but she will need to see a medical provider for a proper examination I have no idea what your medical provider is treating or if Zithromax was the appropriate treatment for your diagnosis Antibiotic do not work for viral infections nor does Zithromax work for everything I would suggest that you call your medical provider for patientspecific advice in this matter Some viral infections have fevers that can last 34 days no matter what medication you are taking I have no way of knowing the accuracy of your diagnosis but Swimmers ear is usually not treated so aggressively Since I do not know what you are taking or if these prescriptions are appropriate your only recourse ios to be examined again I am not a big fan of using an emergency room for this problem but sometimes it is your only option Dont drive on painkillerslet someone else take you The fever is harmless and will help her fight this viral infection Most patients with influenza start improving on day four so just make her comfortable It is okay to use ibuprofen or acetaminophen for the body aches headaches etc that go along with the flu but you really should not let the thermometer determine when you use it Her temperature does not need to be 986 in order for her to get well Its okay to treat the fever to make her feel better but it is not medically necessary Make sure you are giving the proper dose of ibuprofen for her weightmany parents underdose their teenagers I am very sorry but we do not know anything about your grandsonnot even his age Headaches and fever are very nonspecific symptoms and could be signs of HUNDREDS if not thousands of different medical problems If he has not been carefully examined this would be your first step He needs a diagnostic workup We all lose hair periodically  hundreds a day in fact usually hair that is in the resting stage However there can be many reasons for excessive hair loss hypothyroidism nutritional deficiencies skin disorders etc so it would be wise to see a dermatologist so that you can be properly examined and diagnosed Have your medical provider check those lymph nodes Lymph nodes are always therethey do not come and go but you may only be able to feel them or see them when they are enlarged or inflamed The nodes are there for a reason but it will take a bit of medical investigation to determine the underlying cause or if they are actually lymph nodes I dont know the location since you didnt share that important bit of information You need to see a urologist  I am sure you will find very skilled urologists in Japan including some that may speak English Just in case you could bring your own interpretor if you have a trusted bilingual friend Tetanus vaccines are 100 protective against tetanus for TEN YEARS The injection does not protect you against any other wound infection  just tetanus  so good first aid after any injury is always necessary There are much better antiseptics than after shave lotion alcohol so perhaps you should improve your home firstaid kit You can always get wound infections I cant examine you of course but these knots are most likely reactive lymph nodes  You would need to see your medical provider to determine WHY this is happening You need a diagnosis firstnot something that I can provide for you blindly over the Internet Unless the true nature of this hard lump is known and the reason for your night fevers they do not have to be related there is really no way for me or any medical professional for that matter to know if you need an antibiotic let alone a specific antibiotic without an examination Your first and most important step is to be properly examined and diagnosed I would suggest that you NOT selftreat this lump with clindamycin since this may interfere with a culture if your doctor feels this is needed It is not the strongest antibiotic for kids but it is effective for bacterial sinusitis Bacterial sinusitis is uncommon in two year olds since most of their sinuses are immature and undeveloped at this age Statistically most of these toddler sinus infections are VIRAL and viruses as you probably know will not respond to ANY antibiotic no matter how strong Bacterial sinusitis assuming this is what your two year old actually has can be tricky to treat often requiring longer antibiotic courses or a different type of antibiotic Failure to respond in seven days may necessitate a reevaluation of this treatment regime Just because he still has thick or colored mucous does not mean that a the antibiotic is not helping or b the cause is bacterial and not viral Viral infections can cause stagnation of mucous and that alone can result in thick greenyellow mucous You cant really use snot color as a diagnostic clue no matter what your mother told you I do not see how drinking something acidic lemon juice is citric ACID will make your body alkaline Doesnt make sense I have never heard that having an alkaline body alkalosis would prevent a cancer reoccurrence Sounds like a bunch of baloney to me I am not sure where you read this or the credentials of who is recommending it but I think this notion lacks scientific validity Our body works very hard to maintain a properly pH balance Drink lemon juice in water lemonade if you want or if you like it The vitamin C will be nice but dont expect it to make your body alkaline This excellent site should help you httpwwwwebmdcomheartdiseaseguideheartfailure Adolescent male gynecomastia is quite common and will go away in timeusually a few years Since I cant examine you I have no way of knowing the true nature of your fatty breasts There are many different types and degrees of male gynecomastia so it may not look like photos you have found You can have liposuction or a surgical procedure to remove excess fat if you want but this would be considered a cosmetic procedures and most insurances would not be agreeable to paying for it Unfortunately exercises and diet are not likely to fix male breasts so get it checked out by a medical professional I have no way of examining you over the Internet to give you a definite answer only your doctor can do that but one possibility would be a common and temporary condition of preteens and teenagers called SEVERS DISEASE  You can look this up on the Internet and run this possibly by your doctor Have you thought about bariatric weight loss surgery Are you running or exercising naked There are penile conditions that can cause this reaction but you would need to see a urologist to be properly examined Penile retraction can occur because of a ample fat pad in this area or weaker connective tissue Exactly why your penis is deciding to hide during exercise is really a mystery until you see a urologist Since this is causing your pain when you pull your penis back out from its temporary hidden position I strongly advise you to get it properly examined It would not be possible for me to diagnose your daughter over the Internet based solely on the information in your brief posting There can be dozens of reasons but it is going to take a detailed medical history a careful examination and perhaps a few diagnostic tests blood tests in order to narrow down the many possibilities This is your first step Everyones temperatures varies about two degrees a day from the average 986 with the evening temperature being the highest morning is the lowest I dont know the age of your child but even a real fever is NOT DANGEROUS and this mildlyelevated temp is medically insignificant if he is healthy and well That would be a difficult question to answer without the ability to examine you Cold and influenza are viruses and tend to cause similar symptoms Influenza tends to be worse usually with a fever response not just hot or cold flashes Influenza is a respiratory viruses some abdominal symptoms are not typical in adults kids with flu can get them though If I had to take a guess I would say that you most likely have a nasty viral infection but not necessarily influenza The only way to be sure is to have a rapid flu test If you have been ill for less than two days antiviral medications like Tamiflu can be used There is really nothing that can be done for a cold other than symptom control Treating the SYMPTOMS of colds and flu is often the only thing that can be done trying to feel better while Nature orchestrates the cure Both colds and flu last about a week with the first 34 days being the worst HCTZ is a diuetic that can lower your blood pressure It should not decrease your stamina but it could be related to your lightheadedness with standing quickly orthostatic hypotension I would suggest that you see your medical provider  the only that prescribed the HCTZ  for a consultation Yesit is safe The flu vaccine can be given if you have a cold You should tell BOTH your surgeon and your anesthesiologist about your marijuana use A routine urine sample is not a drug test but your surgical team MUST have this information so be open and honest It would be best to have your babys pediatrician properly prescribe for her due to her very young age The list of allergy medicines that can be used is often just lowdose Benadryl Allergies and colds can mimic each other in their array of symptoms at this age Pink eye itself should not cause a fever but some forms of conjunctivitis are VIRAL and are part of a larger array of many coldlike symptoms In this case the viral infection cold could cause fever in some people You always have the right to change doctors especially if you have one who will not listen to your concerns Maybe he is not familiar with this condition called SADS httpwwwcryorgukpharmacyjournalhtm Penicillin is the drug of choice for Strep so maybe there was a Group B Streptococcal infection discovered prenatally that needed treatment This is relatively common This is just a guess however Your son and his GF can certainly answer that question if they want to you to know That depends on several thingsthe AGE of the baby the TYPE of virus and the babys immune response In most causes of simple coldlike viruses a child may have a fever response for the first three or four days His inability to bear weight on this one leg does not necessarily mean the problem is in the hip It could be in the leg knee ankle or foot The reason many xrays are normal is that the problem may not even be due to a bone injury but rather muscle or tendon like a sprain These things do not show up on an xray I even had a nonwalking toddler with a thorn in his foot that no one noticed Toddlers can be wild and crazy and injury themselves in a zillion different ways without you even knowing it The fact that he has not improved in a week is concerning so I would suggest that you take him to see his regular doctor He may need to complete the entire leg xrays series if the doctor feels it is justified One quick story A patient of mine same age woke up from a nap and would not bear weight Several negative xrays negative exams and watchful waiting for three days did not seem him improve I coerced a orthopedic friend to work him into his busy and overbooked schedule so he agreed to see him over lunch This little guy who had been carried for the last three days ran through his waiting room jumped up on some chairs and acted like he did not have a care in the world To this day his parents and myself have no idea why he did not want to walk Perhaps he enjoyed being carried for a while There are hundreds of different respiratory viruses that just cause the common cold There are no rules that state you can only have ONE virus at a time or that viral infections cannot occur backtoback A fever one week into a viral infection can mean a NEW viral infection has occured or that the first virus may now have secondary infection No doctors are not obligated do do what you wantlike a biopsy that they feel may be unnecessary Your only course of action is to see a different surgeon plead your case and get a second opinion Surgeons do not want to just randomly remove or biopsy masses that may be cystic fibrocystic or clearly not suspicious of cancer You have a cancer fear since these are your breaststhe only ones that you feel The surgeon may have years of experience examining thousands of lumpy breasts and reading many mammograms and does not share in your fear or concern You cannot force a surgeon into the operating room no matter how much you demand It would not be likely that you would catch shingles or chicken pox from this very cursory contact of just running together If you did have a close contact skin to skin you may have a remote chance of getting chicken pox the sam virus This early a pregnant woman may not have sufficient HCG to be detected on those tests so repeat them the blood test in a few weeks So yes you can be pregnant If you are having sex not using birth control and you and your partner is not sterile it is only a matter of time before a pregnancy will happen You need to be carefully reexamined by an ENT specialist While labyrinthitis still can be causing some of these residual symptoms there are many other ear conditions that can mimic it The two medications are compatible but many clinicians do not use antihistamines in children who have ear infections since this can thicken the middle ear fluid and make it more difficult to clear in some not all children You may be having exerciseinducted bronchospasm You will need to see your medical provider so you can be properly examined and diagnosed You will need to be specifically cleared by the medical provider who is treating you  the one familar with the details of your case Healing time varies from person to person so there is really no set rules for when to return to strenous activities Before undergoing any drastic weight loss program I am assuming that you would eventually like to lose over a hundred pounds it would be best to see your medical provider Some baseline lab work can be important With that said the amount of calorie restriction would depend on how fast you would like to lose that weight A good weight loss would be about two pound per week That would add up to nearly a hundred pounds in a yeara reasonable and achievable goal at this point Find out what you are eating now the number of calories determined by a honest food diary for a week Reduce those calories by about a 1000 a day I am guessing but I suspect you are ingesting well over 2500 to 3000 calories a day right now based on your weight and the fact that it appears to be stable Keep exercising This is very important and I am so proud that you are doing it The body does not give up weight easily but if you are consistently eating LESS than your body needs to maintain weight your weight will drop and continue to drop until you stop dieting It may not drop every dayor every weekbut at the end of each month you should be considerably less than the weight you started with at the first of the month If not something is amiss so you may need to see a nutritionistdietician or your primary care medical provider to help The first and most important step is getting startedand you have done that on your own I have little doubt that you will succeed Have another blood testa hepatitis panel testing for type A B and C and a liver function panel Once you are positive for one type of hepatitis you are likely to show antibodies for a long long timeperhaps for life A child can have a mild fever with inflammation and allergies can certainly cause inflammation It would be highly unlikely for an adult with a mature immune system to get a fever solely from allergies There is usually another cause Hello i have googled this specific question with the intention of answering all the queries that exist on the web with regards to this question because i myself had been suffering this for the last 4 months and it made me feel really sick uneasy and tired and i hated the feeling of having to always keep myself in cool places and have to have three baths a day to just feel normalI finally found the cure in an unlikely place I have always had a little feeling of sickness when in warm places since a young age but it got really bad 4 months back and every normal doctor i went to did all medical checks but all parameters such as blood pressure temperature and blood test etc were normal but i still was feeling heat since i am in india somebody suggested i visit an ayurvedic doctorayurvedic doctors are doctors who prescribe medicines and treatments according to an ancient indian text called the ayurveda httpenwikipediaorgwikiAyurveda so i made the trip to a well known ayurvedic doctor at the rejuvenation center at an ashram called isha in coimbatore tamil nadu india and the doctor there just felt my wrist and started her diagnosis and without me even telling her the symptoms she said everything is normal but there is a lot of heat trapped in your system and she said it is not a very rare problem she said that no mainstream medicine doctor has been able to diagnose it till date cause there is no such thing as body heat in allopathicmainstream medicine there is only temperature she said in ayurveda its called ushnaheat and she said no need to go into the cause of it just have these ayurvedic medicines and i have been having them for three days now and i can feel the heat slowly leaving my system i am suppose to take the medicines for 40 days but just today being the third day i am already feelin 60 better and ease has returned to the whole body and she also gave me some medicines to repair the minor damage to the system from this heat so i would like to suggest to anybody who is having this problem that if no doctor is able to help then please no matter what country you are in please look for a good ayurvedic or siddhahttpenwikipediaorgwikiSiddhamedicine doctor nowadays they are all over the world and if there isnt one in your country then do make the trip to india and i highly recommend the one i went to even if it is expensive to make the trip it is better to spend that then live with the problem for the rest of your life or contact them at httpwwwishafoundationorgIshaRejuvenation they might be able to ship the medicines if you are in a different country hope youll all get okay soon cause i have been through the frustrating experience of going to many mainstream doctors and not finding a solution till this happened and i feel like a real fool for doubting that any alternative medicine science could actually have something very simple but powerful in it I have had Fibromyalgia for thirty years It is a debilitating condition that had gotten progressively worse through the years I was at a point where I was physically unable to do most things people take for granted Walking climbing stairs standing from a sitting position had become extremely difficult The overwhelming pain and stiffness throughout my body was never ending I spent years going to countless doctors to no avail The medical community does not have any answers for this condition I was living on pain medication which had little effect I tried a support group at a local rehab hospital and did not find it helpful In fact I found it to be depressing I have always tried to be positive through this whole ordeal I never gave up searching for the cure I have to admit I was getting discouraged I had lived most of my life in constant pain something no one can understand unless they have experienced it It was discouraging to think I would spend the rest of my life like this My sister called me on day last year stating that she had heard of a local doctor who had opend a practice dedicated to treating pain He claimed to have a treatment for Fibromyalgia I felt I had nothing to lose so I made an appointment to see him His name is Dr DAmato His practice is called Calmar Pain Refief Therapy and is located in West Warwick Rhode Island After the first treatment I felt a difference in my level of pain I continued for ten more threatments over the course of two weeks At the end of my treaments the pain and stiffness was almost gone My level of pain was down 95 It was my cure I felt I was given my life back I was able to return to a life I left a long time ago I started exercising again Before I became disabled by the fibro I was very active and exercised regularly After my treatment I joined a gym started walking and swimming regularly I am still working out with a trainer just as I did many years ago I am recommending anyone with pain to Google Calmar Pain Relief Therapy It is almost a year after my treatments and although I have noticed a little regression with some of the pain I am still 85 to 90 pain free I know you live in another state but It would be worth the trip Plus Rhode Island is a very pretty state to visit Good Luck Thats absolutely normal Its your scar tissue causing that feel and appearance OCD Do you have a history

needed Talk to your OBGYN Is it possible that your base temperature in lower than average In my family my mother my daughter and I all have a base body temperature of 968 I discovered mine when I was trying to get pregnant and taking my temperature to see when I was ovulating If that is the case every time you are in the ER or doctors office you have to remind them of that When the themometer shows that we have a temperature of 100 it is that same as 102 in an average person Most big problems start of as small problems that you dont address Treat back pain as a symptom of dysfunction not a cause The cause of back pain is rarely at the site of the pain Most people have slight postural imperfections which end up causing pain in other parts of their body Postural imperfections are magnified by such things as slouching over the computer holding the phone between ear and shoulder and by hand and foot dominance in the sports most regularly played Its not the chair its how you sit in it If muscles are not getting stronger theyre getting weaker httpwwwelswickchiropracticcom to be honest eat a hobinero pepper it will clear it right up i do it and have my 4 year old do it Coldcongestion is considered as a Stress situation to our body Therefore usually our body acts by raising blood sugar as it needs to provide energy to fight infection In nondiabetic persons this situation is handled well but in diabetics that would be associated with increased sugar levels Hope your daughter would have a rapid recovery Do not worry just do as your doctors has asked to because they know better the situation and know what problems could face your husband during this period Your body may still be in the process of adjusting to your new exercise strategy You may have also take in a lot of fatty foods lately You may try no surgery fat loss procedures to get rid of unwanted body fats hmmdont eat too soon beforeafter you eat that could be it I share y our concern Guidelines Try to find someone who will recommend one Older docs are best Pick a female next Doctors seem to be ignorant of the latest medical advances When asked about a certain procedure that is less invasive they immediately want you to agree have the outdated procedure that they are familiar They will not listen to your concerns No answers to your question about the latest In office procedures that are equivalent They have another patient waiting One PA twice suggested I medicate myself Re A sore that would not heal I used triple antibiotic with no results He suggested that I should go home and try use bacitracin 3 days no improvement Finally I washed the area with DYNA HEX 4 Sore healed and was gone in 2 days At the followup I told him what I did to heal myself His response was WHAT EVER WORKS Another specialist wanted to remove my friends gall bladder even tho there were No stones seen only some shadows Gall bladder not needed Operation refused Do not expect much help at a walk in clinic I went to one and waited 3 hours then I left An ENT I went to for a sinus problem Diagnosis sinus Infection After 3 days of dosing I had a reaction and went to the emergency room with chest pressure and low oxy levels Out in 2 days Medicare paid for everything Good Luck PS Even this site has no Info on TMAO testing or DMG use Google them Please take your child to the ER and get the Dr there to refer you to an oncologist This could be an indicator of cancer or it might be nothing more than a swollen lymph gland but you dont want to take chances with your child I know Good luck sounds like shin splits to me yes its normal my gram went throw that From an article on WebMD that I found If the spinal cord or nerves become squeezed \t\t symptoms may include Numbness weakness cramping or pain in the \t\t\t legs feet or buttocks These symptoms get worse when you walk stand \t\t\t straight or lean backward The pain gets better when you sit down or lean \t\t\t forward Stiffness in the legs and thighs Low back \t\t\t pain In severe cases loss of bladder and bowel control Symptoms may be severe at times and less severe at other \t\t times Most people will not be severely disabled In fact many people do not \t\t have symptoms at all From this it doesnt look like vertigo is typical but I would speak to my doctor Here is the article if you want to read more httpwwwwebmdcombackpaintclumbarspinalstenosistopicoverview First I would talk to your parents to make sure they know whats going on I would try and track or take mental note about what might be causing this to see if there is a pattern Maybe its either a food or environmentrelated allergy  some things to think about 1  is it when you eat a lot of dairy Sometimes dairy can cause this sort of reaction 2  articificial ingredients in foods sometimes make people have reactions  I have a friend whos child is actually allergic to all food coloring dyes 3  are you drinking enough water Then you said it mostly happens in winter and when running  if you are doing that outside could it be that there is something outside during this time of year that is causing it Maybe an allergy test is in order I would again talk to my parents and see a doctor with as much info as possible so that you are informed going in Hope this helps YES Go to a doctor  now If you cant afford a mammogram let me know and I will get you in contact with a place to get one for free I had a friend with the same problem in High School Along with antibiotics his dermatologist recommended that he wash his face with a mild soap MANY times a day and moisturize with an acne friendly face lotion Maybe you can just call the clinic and ask them to refill the RX for antibiotics If youve been seen 2x before by the same physician they should have no problem refilling it over the phone for you How did the infection start Acne Bud bite If its acne start washing Hope this helps I would go o the ER just to be on the safe side Anytime you have any doubt you should get it checked out Have you had a ultra sound done yet Hope this helps I too have a torn ACL and a bad meniscus I find that the best ab exercises for me are regular crunches six inches planks and leg lifts I would stay away from the bicycle crunches but thats the only ab exercise that has caused me knee pain I would think it would be from allergies due to the ventilation If you havent already I would try taking some kind of allergyantihistamine medicine and maybe give it a couple days to actually work properly and see if it makes a difference I am by no means a doctor but thats my suggestion Hope I help Yes see a Dr if you currently are having pain or limited mobility  I had my right knee replaced 11 months ago The surgeon will take several images of your thigh knee and leg and send scans off to some place that will design a customize replacement just for your knee  Mine was made of stainless steel My doctor had an actual one to show me in his office So I do not think that anything else would be changed I asked a half dozen friends the name of the surgeon who replaced their knee and chose the doctor most frequently mentioned  of course I asked if they would use himher again if needed During my inhouse physical therapy I met 3 patients who had both knees replaced  Jokingly I added that it sound like a crazy thing to do The responses were  since each knew that the other one would eventually need replacing 1 for insurance reasons 2 to minimize time taken off from work Hope this helps and good luck PS Since my right knee was replaced it took several weeks before I could drive my car You might want to take this into consideration Wear your brace An answer I found elsewhere Lemon lime apple cider vinegar and tomato are highly acidic Strong acids bring the pH of a solution waaay down even in small amounts Also your blood has a buffer system to neutralize acids keeping your blood pH relatively stable regardless of what you eat It seems to me that this alkaline cooking fad has no scientific basis or at least led by misguided science I really dislike throwing around scientific words when you dont know what you are talking about There is a site you can go on for all the support you need it is wwwpatientslikemecomthere you can get supportsuggestionshelpask questions and track your pain and any progress along the wayI use it and it is a great site Dr Moser is incorrect Lemon and lime juices are absolutely alkalizing to the body This is not to say they are alkaline in nature because the are obviously acidic But the way the body metabolizes the juice produces an alkalizing effect Here is a video that might help explain it better youtubecomwatchvWndFDIa6a0sfeatureplayerembedded There are many licensed dietitians and nutritionist who have written of this fact Do yourself a favor and research it at length Most doctors are not aware of the chemistry involved NOTE the average MD has fewer than 8 hours of preventative medicine education  many have none whatsoever I like putting a drop or two of colloidal silver its a natural antibiotic My neighbors into natural stuff and shes pretty informed on this sort of thing I use it for my eyes when I forget to take contacts out at night The next morning my eye feels scratchie  A drop of colloidal silver in my eye and its gone I buy it at whole foods sorry earlier answer sent too quickly bradycardia can be caused by hypothyroid the medication thyroxine should speed up system although if not enough dosage then not as effective Yes if needed and this shouldnt keep you from living your life I would not let any doctor do surgery on my spine unless really needed and if the cysts are NOT bothering you much and you can live with them then just keep a watch on them and live your life the best you can i honestly dont see why not u are almost to ur due date and it will help with labor in the long run He definitely found it that time It takes whatever time it takes The fitter you are the faster it will drop though it will always take a while to return fully to the resting rate Your resting heart rate should be somewhere in the 60s or 70s Thats the rate when you have been sitting or lying for a while As you get fitter it could drop even lower Some athletes have resting heart rates in the 40s Mine is currently in the high 50s because I lift weights and exercise 6 days a week Hope this helps running for 30mins in the morning Yes it can be caused by the cold weather we might always feel warm but is the cold that is inside the body that is causing this pain and swell I am a type 2 diabetic and every time my insulin is increased I gain 10 pounds Even though doctors tell you insulin doesnt make you gain weight I dont believe it epidermal andor dermal problems blood chemistry is returning to normal range If this feeling was caused by running a race or by running a lot faster than your normal pace then its most likely lactic acid Its ok to run just run at an easy pace for a few days I usually feel this way after any 10k or more race Nothing to worry about As a sixty year old male I can tell you that Intercourse is a risky business Men at our age may be fearful of not being able to perform That having been said here is what needs to happen You must start a conversation about your desires and expectations I find that many people want to have sex but they dont want to talk about sex You not mature enough to have sex if you are not mature enough to talk about sex ask if there is a medical problem then ask if there is something that can be done BLUE PILL AND THE LIKE DONT MAKE INTERCOURSE THE BE ALL AND END ALL OF SEX There other ways to be intimate Serious foreplay and oral sex role playing games mutual masturbation be willing to explore and be willing to do what it takes to satisfy each other REMEMBER THE BRAIN IS THE LARGEST SEXUAL ORGAN IN THE BODY NOW GO PLAY AND HAVE FUN All pertaining to the surgery Give it a little more time It is hard sometimes for people to imagine that the rectum is so close to the vagina and that the female pelvic organs I would say if it is no better or not resolving follow up Continue to monitor the fever and surg site My son went through this same thing when he was younger the doctor ran all sorts of tests and did the IV antibiotics and no change If your daughter is sleeping a lot along with the other symptoms have her doctor check for mono disease This is what my son was diagnosed with and it took a month and a half after diagnoses for it to go away Also try the mixture of ibuprofen and Tylenol together for the fever I hope she feels better soon Good luck I cant think of the name of it but I beleive there is nasal spray which may or may not also be for allergies that works for dryness too Ask your pharmacist i get some of my best information from them Good luck If I think of the name I will try to answer again Thanks for asking this question I dated a man he was in his mid40s for awhile who was asexual He was affectionate otherwise We traveled together slept together but we never had sex We split up for other reasons nonrelated to this I found some information on the internet but not much to explain why this is so for some Certainly other medical issue can come into play but I dont think that was true in this case Remember that muscle weighs more than fat Youre gaining a lot of muscle with all this exercising so some weight gain is normal If youre concerned about it ask your doctor The body responds to what is known as the SAID principle Specific Adaptations to Imposed Demands When you look at marathon runners they are generally thin but actually have a higher body fat  than sprinters This is an adaptation when you run for long periods your body needs energy If your exercise program has no variation your body adapts and begins to hold on to its fat so that it has energy stores to be used during long runs i think its acid build up that gives the cramp usually athlete having cramp means theyre not physicallyconditionally fit to get muscle cramp You may be losing inches Not just lowering your number on the scale  It might sound strange but I had triglycerides over 1000 and got them to normal range with lots of black tea and 5000 mg of EPA DHA Omega3 fish oil supplements daily The fish oil was at my MDs advice but didnt seem to work until I started drinking plain black tea in place of water  5 tea bags in 64 oz water daily I think you may have osteoarthritispain of jointsbecause your symptoms match the symptoms of Osteoarthritis To make sure if you have it or not you should visit an orthopedician I am asking what factors to consider while buying shoes That will provide extra comfort as I am having Backache httpwwwhypedccomnewbalance Have you ever taken Celexa When I tried to get off this I felt like I was having brain shocks  went back on a lower dose and the shocks stopped not surebut maybe have your sugar checked sometimes a low sugar level will case thattry orange juice and peanut butter crackers if handy a sugar and a protein but definitely consult a dr go to your doctor the one that did the surgery he know first hand after xrays I would definitely look into and have retested by the Endorinologist I have dealt with unexplained pain fatigue weight gain Asthma symptoms Asthma Meds did not helpand many other symptoms and doctors were unable to come up with a diagnosis Thyroid tested fine etc I did find out that I have GERD this is due to vagus stomach nerve not working but none of the meds I tried seemed to help wthose symptoms either My diet doctor tested my thyroid function and found it to be a little low She prescribed a 14 grain of NatureThroid daily and the difference in my joint pain alone is amazing She also prescribed Phentermine which not only helps me lose weight but seems to work in conjunction with Thyroid Med My symptoms of fibro get even better when I am taking both of them I wake up feeling refreshed I dont have trouble walking due to aching joints I used to get so tired I would stutter and forget what I was talking about midsentence Even my stomach problems have all but disappeared Do the research there are many sites and support groups for Fibromyalgia online I would also look into symptoms of low thyroid mine was not that low and was causing lots of havoc Also I think finding the right type of Doctor for exmy Diet Doctor deals with thyroid problems daily and therefore is more knowledgeable is key I would get as much info as I could regarding my symptoms so as to be better able to paint a clearer picture of what is going on to the Endocrinologist you are going to see After you remove a tick there is going to be a red bump very itchy I have had them take more then 2 weeks to heal It will also be red around the area too Just keep an eye on it if the red spot around the bump persist to get bigger it can be a sign of lymes disease and you want to get the checked out as soon as possible try and get testedi used to have upper stomach gnaws occassionally that could lead todiarrhoea and vomitingthen it clearsand comes back after about 6 months but for about 3 yrsjust recently i got diagnosed with Hpylori after they tested my blood sample and am better after medication shine splints is a contubustion of alot of things not wearing the proper foot wear for the activity your in It could be a virus such as norovirus that comes from food poisoning Because of the severe abdominal pain and because you are not getting better I would go to the ER Marieh9 restless leg symdrom sounds like to me I had fusions at l45 L5S1 and the thing I noticed in post op was that pain in my leg was gone But If I was in the same pain I was in before last surgery I think I might check out a couple other Drs And They would be the leading Drs in their field The more you get cut on the more sscar tissue pain and neurilogical pain  Thats a tough Question Have you considered a pain pump I wouldnt trade mine for anything good luck I had a similar problem Was having periods night and day I had finally put a very physically and mentally husband in my rear views I got to know a fellow and it was past the 3rd date etcccU know my gyn went in with laser to clean out pallops and such and it worked nearly 2 yrs Then the 2nd time he said it was unlikely i would ever see a period again othr than some spotting But itwas gone He forgot and 2appts after that he figured out i had been in menopause early onset for the last year and half He really is a good dr but he had a few to many babies popping out and threw him off his game Only a doctor could correctly diagnose this problem through xrays It sounds like you quite possibly may have damaged something within your knee Get it checked out as soon as you can Your potassium level is low I had this problem and i went to the dr and they told me most muscle cramps are related to a low potassium level Either get your dr to perscribe you some potassium pills or just eat things with alot of potassium in them and drink gatoradeand or powerade because it has a high potassium level in them I know it helped me def see a doctor and untill you know whats going on i would stop running  try ice and heat packs to keep the pain down 20 min at a time if you see swelling ice if theres no swellling only pain heat   hope this helps feel better no thats something different  that kind of charley horse is due to the lack of air in your mussel  its a from of rigamortis the same chemical that makes your body stiff when ur dead  what happens is you legs use the air in your blood to constrict the mussel when ur running  i was in track myself as a kid and this happen to me as well when u push the body beyond its limits the mussel when then use a chemical  sorry i dont remember the name in place of air  because your body hasent enough air at that time to forfill the need this cause the stiffness it like i said really a from of rigamortis  pretty cool huh its normal to feel stiff for a bit  i felt very sore for a day or so after  it happend to me durning a race which im happy to sya i had won  its nothing to worry about  i hope this answerd your question  yeast is inside your intestines its the stuff thathelps break down our food  but it is possible that sweating has cause some yeast to enter your vag area  i would say drink plenty of water to help it flush out and try to keep yourself extra clean to avoid it repeating  you need to see an experienced doctor to give you the turn your head and cough while he is squeezing your testes seems like a forgotten art in the medical world make sure he knows his business and is honest take the time to tell him exactly whats going on in your life and body like any accedents or exercises that may have contributed to your condition I should have went to med school think carefully and be very honest and exact Beg him to be honest and sincere make sure he earns his money What would I do If the amount of bleeding has not slowed ice and elevate for 24 hours Still no change See a doctor Maybe you would benefit from stitches As for the swelling redness and heat are signs of possible infection Feet are dirty sites so see a doctor But also consider your feet ache and throb after a day at the mall This is due to increased blood flow which can make it hard for a wound to heal Ice and elevate above the heart ie lay with foot propped on pillows after walking whenever you can and at bedtime OTC ibuprofen for pain and swelling stay away from aspirin it is a blood thinner The pain swelling and throbbing may last weeks because you are constantly irritating the injury when you walk But you should see gradual improvement As always if things just dont seem right see your doctor The earlier the attention the quicker the recovery Good Luck A complete blood count includes Hemoglobin and Hematocrit If they are low then you may have anemia A doctor may then get more blood to check your Ferritin and Iron levels Blood pressure will be high after excersising Moving around will cause the BP to go up which is why they always have you sit when you are at the doctors office Even just standing can raise your BP I would let your doctor know this at your next visit though as I am not sure if it should be going that high Good Luck Hi my name is nohealani and believe it or not when my nose gets that bad as wierd as this may sound when I go to sleep at nite or when Im at home relaxing I get some tissue and roll it up and put it up each of my nostrilsIt really helps me at nite because Im not constantly getting up to blow my nose It usually takes a few days but before you know it your nose will dry up sounds wierd but wouldnt hurt to try it and it doesnt cost anything Could be thrush Also The recent symptons are I stay healthy I run bike and eat healthy I cant even go running or biking anymore without almost collapsing I live in Phoenix The longer I run or bike the colder my body becomes I mean like ice cold Other people have felt my body coming in doors after doing this and they are shocked at how cold I feel AND  the coldness moves around On my back will be on left are then left are warm then right arm frozen etc My doctors are at a loss I cant handle this anymore Please help Talk to your pharmacist who will probably tell you to talk to your doctor 0 ABSOLUTELY NOT That is not only cruel but also dangerous Children are much more prone to dehydration heat exhaustion and heat stroke If they run until they vomit they are most likely dehydrated If a child has an underlying heart problem and become dehydrated it could cause very serious problems There is not one single thing safe about doing that I think when you have a new symptom and especially pain you should see a doctor There is nothing wrong with running in your third trimester as long as your pregnancy is not high risk just be careful as your centre of gravity is slightly off so you are more likely to lose your balance Go easy and you will be fine Doesnt sound like an ACL so much More like either a Bakers cyst or an aneurysm I dont know much about Bakers cysts but thats where they happen Could also be a ganglion cyst Ive seen aneurysms though Get it fixed By the way get a good doctor Apparently the surgical approach is important Just learned that recently for the Bakers Cyst Get a second opinion The lateral approach could end with tingling down the lateral aspect of the lower leg Small town doctor versus a big city doctor Just what I was told All due respect No Sounds like dehydration Are you drinking enough water when you run You need to make sure that you increase your intake of water when you work out You sweat out a lot of your fluids when you work out so they need to be replenished Also dont work out on a completely empty stomach It will make your blood sugar decrease which could also make you dizzy when you work out httppmahoneybuythistodayinfo httppmahoneybuythistodayinfo My question is marked as private on my profile so I am not sure if anyone can see it except for me If you can see this question and answer just give me any response Thanks hopefully you have seen a doctor about this strain if it seems serious it may be a torn muscle and may cause other problems Mistreating an abdominal strain either by icing or stretching wrong could be fatal speak to a doctor before treating a sprain  Over extension or overuse of the muscle not a good idea Charley Charlie Horse is muscle that is telling you that it doesnt have enough oxygen or other necessary chemicals to work properly You could damage your muscles by not listening to your bodies indication that something is wrong Muscle can bleed and this can cause a lot of pain You need to rest the muscle that is in pain not push it further Yes it can contribute to COPD symptoms You should not be exposing yourself to any chemicals Home heating fuel oil when the furnace is not working properly can release fumes and oil into the air This sounds like an OSHA issue if in the States you should not be exposed to this nor should anyone else be exposed 2448 hours depends on whats wrong Sounds like blood poisontake to the Doctor immediately May be an infection process You are able to get chicken pox since youve never had chicken pox unless you have been vaccinated But you will not get shingles since you have not yet had chicken pox I have a couple of questions before I can answer you Do these nosebleeds occur only when you are inside If so are you using a humidifier Dry air is a major reason for frequent nosebleeds Try using a saline nasal spray four timesday Are you on Blood pressure medications  This might be the cause A check in with your Doc might be in order Pickle juice has salts and electrolytes in it much like gatorade which replaces the electrolytes you lose through sweating preventing cramps My cousin played football in high school in georgia and he says the football team would drink pickle juice during 2 a days in the summer to stay hydrated He swears by it and says itre hydrates faster than water If your having new problems breathing go to an emergency room near you or call 911 The other information is not useful to further diagnose you without an examination andor tests If you have had a past medical history of blood clots or recent surgery you should call 911 imediately At first when she told me that sex was out and kissing was out I was devastated as I was most attracted Since then we have cuddled and I have found another who is more participatory Maybe this other gal is better for me I am busy trying to find my way in a forest of goddesses so the key is how well you can talk especially about sex If it avoided as a topic it may be the best indicator that it will not improve unfortunately Friendships are fine but they really take second place to a potential sexual and sensual partner So the priorities shift based on what you think is happening and the only way to judge is based on what is said In many cases it takes risk to raise certain subjects and once one risk is made unsuccessfully another risk is less likely and the final outcome is evident Cant get blood from a stone Norl sexual love from someone unwilling thats a good taboo Find someone willing is the only way out of the dilemma Weight Loss Free Training Go to  httpwww123lossblogspotcom Anytime my son is teething he runs a low grade fever and salivates alot With a temp that high I recommend calling
