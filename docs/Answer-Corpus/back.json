{"text": "I WAS TAKING PILLS BUT NOW DISCONTINUE BUT IT STOPS MY PERIODS ALTHOUGH I M NOT PREGNANT HOW TO GET PERIODS AGAIN Sounds like a UTI urinary tract infection even if its not this you should see your doctor Good Luck see your General Practitioner they can help advise you It is possible that you are pregnant If you want to be sure take a home pregnancy test or make an appointment with your doctor If the home test comes back negative you may want to see your doctor anyways just to make sure everything is okay It would be good to see a competent orthopedic specialist They have many tests such as xrays CT scans MRIs discograms that can help diagnose your condition Have you checked if has had a fall somewhere or hurt while playing Please do not ignore and take him to a doctor Hope he gets well soon As a mother do understand how traumatising it can be when kids fall ill Take care   Neurontin Gabapentin has been approved for the treatment of seizure conditions It also is indicated for use in neuropathy Neurontin is legally prescribed by physicians to treat numerous other conditions that have not been officially recognized by the federal government for its usage off label prescribing at the physicians discretion such as back pain restless leg syndrome and even bipolar conditions Years ago I had severe back pain that was nonresponsive to medications and epidural treatments under general anesthesia Where those methods failed to relieve my back problems Neurontin proved be my silver bullet treatment I can tell you first hand that Neurontin kept me standing erect reduced my pain and allowed me to continue working At least 15 years has passed and I continue to take 1 one 600 mg tablet 3xs per day No medication is perfect for everybody and it has some sideeffects but I can without hesitation fully endorse Neurontin for the treatment of back pain The IR abbreviation in your question stands for Immediate Release Your doctor has determined the current medication dosage based upon your age weight and probably gave the highest consideration to their dosage decision based upon your pain level The typical adult dose of Oxycodone IR is considered to be between 5 mg and 15 mg every 46 hours for pain More than 30 mg every 46 hours for pain in adults is rarely needed The dose for geriatric patients is listed at 25 mg every 46 hours Many experts on the subject of Oxycodone dosage would not consider you to fit the definition of geriatric until you reach at least 65 years of age I also suspect that your prescription contains language such as PRN or As Needed Therefore if your prescription provides the As Needed instruction you should only take the Oxycodone as needed for pain and less frequently than every 46 hours Summary Your doctor is aware that Oxycodone IR is a narcotic that should be prescribed with great caution If your pain is severe I see nothing unreasonable in taking Oxycodone IR 15 mg It is recommended that you have another conversation with your doctor about your level of pain and what action should be taken as your pain lessens From the tone of your question it appears that you suffer from intense back pain Severe back pain can control your life and needs to be medically assessed I suspect that youll be disappointed with OTC medications to treat your back pain as they probably wont touch your pain With that said you may consider taking Ibuprofen Ibuprofen is available OTC in a strength of 200 mg Prescription strengths of Ibuprofen are available in 400 mg 600 mg and 800 mg Therefore you could buy OTC Ibuprofen and take up to 4 pills to provide you with the maximum 800 mg strength This practice should only be considered to gain some short term relief 23 weeks max It should also be noted that like most medications Ibuprofen can have serious side effects and even cause stomach ulcers It should be taken with a meal or milk and the daily dosage should not exceed 3200 mg My suggestion is to see a pain management specialist who can prescribe something stronger and assess possible back damage and provide other treatment options Physical therapy and biofeedback may also help or you may need a prescribed narcotic to obtain pain resolution Multiple side effects exist for both of these medications These side effects are sometimes divided between common less common and rare Lets look at each drugs patient information sheet as supplied with the medication as it relates to side effects and your tired feeling  1 Gabapentin  This is an antiseizure medication that is also used to treat other conditions such as your back pain Unusual tiredness or weakness is reported as a less common side effect As an anecdotal point of reference I have personally been taking Gabapentin 600 mg 1 tablet 3xs per day for over 15 years without feeling tired Of course were all unique and medications affect us differently 2 Lisinopril  This drug is used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure Unusual tiredness or weakness is reported as a MORE COMMON side effect and it is recommended to call your doctor immediately My Conclusions  Both Gabapentin and Lisinopril both report tiredness as a possible side effect  Gabapentin less commonly and Lisinopril more commonly  More is needed to be known about your possible other medical conditions to eliminate them as a cause of being excessively tired  More information is needed as to when you first started each medication and when you first started to feel overly tired  Your blood pressure appears to be normal abet on the lower side is not a hypotensive reading and probably is not the cause of your being overly tired  I recommend that you contact your doctor assoonaspossible to report your feeling tired It could be a serious medication side effect or represent some other medical disturbance Let me be honest Experts sometimes disagree on the seriousness of degenerative issue and their relevance as a diagnosis and treatment approches Some medical doctors believe that most people approching 30 years of age have some evidence of degerative changes which is a normal part of agingYou do not deserved to be treated poorly and nobody should be forced to endure pain or seek relief through purchasing pain medicationoff the streets With that said receiving pain medications from many doctors is becoming a practice of the past The trend today is for physicans to refer patients such as yourself to pain management specialists and clinicsThe pain management process usually starts off with the lowest level of treatment options and slowly ratches up to more aggresive treatments For example you may be instucted to lose weight wear some sort of back brace otc pain medications applying heat and ice bed rest physical therapy steriodal injections massage and strengthing exercisesThis conservative treatment approach is lengthly and in many cases will not resolve the condition or relieve your painEventually you may be prescribed mild prescription medications such as painkillers and narcotics or offered epidural injections and sometimes back surgery Even the diagnostic testing is fueled by the conservative treatment efforts outlined above Physical exams and Xrays are first utilized with MRIs being ordered much later Much of the sluggish process involved in cases such as you have are due in part to insurance carrier regulations and as your question suggests sterotyping of some individuals motivation for treatment being to obtain narcotic drugs You may try going in other directions by seeing an accupunture doctor a chiropracter doctor or even a hypnotherapist Sometimes these unconventional doctors and therapist are effective in relieving the pain I am sorry that the news is so bleak about caring for people suffering from degenerative bone disease For additional information click on the link below to see an article from WebMd on the topic I wish you well httpwwwwebmdcomosteoarthritisguidespinalosteoarthritisdegenerativearthritisofthespine The doctor appears to have appropriately treated your back pain Prednisone is prescribed in your case to relieve arthritic conditions Cyclobenzaprine is prescribed to eliminate painful muscle spasms As long as the following suggestions does not conflict with your physicians orders you may find that moist heat ice packs analgesics and bed rest will reduce the pain level in your back It could be Sciatica although the pain may be more intense while lying down and sitting with that condition Does the pain extend down to your ankles and feet If so this is suggestive of a Sciatic Nerve disorder Back pain resulting from disc bulging pinched nerves muscle pulls other medical conditions such as growth masses  bone fractures and narrowing of the spinal column stenosis are other possibilities I suggest that you make an appointment to be evaluated by a primary care doctor This individual may review your medical history interview you for the pain quality exact location of your pain pain level flushout possible traumatic events that may have occurred prescribe medications including analgesics and antiinflammatory nonsteroidal drugsconduct blood and urine lab work  get the ball rolling with a radiographic xray This doctor may also refer you to other medical specialists In summary Lower back pain costs the American Economy large amounts of money in medical expenses lost work hours worker compensation claims doctor office visits and intense pain experienced by the patient This type of symptomology requires resolution beginning first with a clear diagnosis Once a diagnosis is established treatment efforts may be started moving from conservation forms like cortisone injections analgesics bed rest pillows placed under the knees chiropractic treatments and ice and heat treatments Although these symptoms sometimes may virtually spontaneously improve in conjunction with some conservative efforts more aggressive testing like MRIs and surgical intervention is frequently necessary It can take a lengthily time to achieve relief months or even years I wish that the process was less cumbersome and more patient friendlyUnfortunately medical insurance companies through their beancounting policies directed at cost saving make most of the bigger treatmenttesting decisions todayThe physician many time finds that their decisions are overturned by some HMO clerk following a complicated reimbursement and procedure manual These sometimes uncaring and reckless institutional decisions can delay diagnosis and the starting of treatment efforts Hopefully a cause for your symptoms will rapidly be determined but please dont count on any quick fix Best wishes for your health improvement Neurontin Gabapentin should not be stopped without discussing the issue with the prescribing doctor Heres why Neurontin was prescribed by a doctor believing that you required this medication Some conditions such as seizure disorders may require a replacement drug Neurontin has the potential for serious and uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms The Neurontin daily dose should tapered down under medical supervision by reducing the dosage over the course of one week Neurontin comes in varying strengths from 100 mg  800 mg capsules or tablets The maximum daily dose could be as high as 3200 mg 800 mg 4xs per day I realize that youve only been taking this med for 6 days but the greater the daily dosage being taken the longer period of time to complete the withdrawal process safely Summary If you are experiencing nasty side effects from Neurontin the medication should either be totally stopped or the daily dosage reduced Both of these alternative resolutions needs to be done in conjunction with the prescribing physician There really is no researchable information available to determine the life expectancy of a 93 year old women with stage 4 renal failure But I hope that the following information will be helpful According to a social security calculator program a 93 year old female has a remaining life expectancy of 389 years The same calculator reports her chance of dying this year at 178 But these are only raw numbers based upon statistical averages Every individual is unique Even with her kidney disease being tired lack of appetite and hallucinations she could survive for some length of time or she could pass away shortly One thing for certain is that her pain can be and should be controlled I wish your aunt you and your family peace during this time of uncertainty I do not believe that a high serum LDL is related to your symptoms Were your blood sugar levels in range Besides pain high blood sugar levels are a common feature of this disease Acute pancreatitis claimed my brothers life at the age of 58 It is a serious disease that can be life threatening It is a horrible disease and can result in a painful death What was the cause of your acute pancreatitis It is crucial to know the original cause of your condition and that treatment had been and continues to be directed at that cause Causes may be attributable to chronic drinking of alcohol my brother rarely even drank a beer digestive conditions and sometimes heredity factors I recommend that you consult with a University Hospital Endocrinologist Specialist to receive the highest quality of treatment for diseases that may be related to the pancreases  Nohard thank you for your answer Your suggested article was interesting and appreciated I had read that Tart Cherry Juice specifically contains antiinflammatory properties which helps with nerve control may improve gout symptoms and protects against muscle damage and the development of arthritis Im taking a leap of hope that some WebMd posters may have tried Tart Cherry Juice and can report on their experiences I m looking for some reliable accountings from our peers to either support or refute what I had read The product is somewhat pricy but worth it if is effective in treating back pain Lung cancer may spread to other organs of the body including the stomach or to the other lung When cancer spreads to other organs it is referred to as metastasis Therefore a cancer originating in the lungs and which has spread to the stomach is called  Sometimes it can be difficult to determine which original organ was first assaulted by cancer cells At times the metastasized cancer may actually be uncovered and treated before the primary organ where the cancer originated is discovered Treatment options are dependent on the number of tumors the stage of cancer development when discovered in the stomach and the overall general health of the patient Since the total areas where cancer has spread is unknown surgery for removal of the stomach is not the usual treatment preference More likely are chemotherapy alternatives that can systematically attack all of the cancer cells  Youre most likely behaving that way in response to unrelieved pain There is a strong relationship between being in a chronic state of pain and experiencing emotional distress Pain can cause individuals to become depressed and angry It can become a vicious cycle where a person has ongoing and severe pain and then becomes upset moody anxious and angry They have more pain and become even angrier and perhaps even agitated When the anger turns to aggressiveness and violence immediate emotional help must be sought Otherwise the chronic pain and the resultant aggressive behavior may cause you to suffer disciplinary and legal consequences I recommend that you consider following some of the below listed suggestive actions Hopefully some of these suggestions will be helpful At this point youre probably just tired of being in pain Nobody should have to experience chronic pain to the extent that it overtakes their basic personality and controls their life Pneumonia is treated with antibiodics and symptomatically When

physical exam and possibly other tests such as an Xray or MRI You dont say what your age is but its important to remember men can get  just like women Among many possible causes for your pain is a stress fracture of the pelvis due to osteoporosis Of course many other conditions could be contributing to the pain youre experiencing Your best bet is to get an examination by a medical professional You can start with your primary care provider He or she will guide you toward appropriate treatment if necessary Best wishes to you Im sorry to hear youre going through this Youre obviously anxious to

due to your other conditions I know its hard to wait not to mention scary but waiting is your best bet Trust your doctor Hang in there I hope you get answers soon Yes these things definitely could be related and you should seek immediate medical attention by calling 911 The symptoms you describe could indicate an that requires immediate treatment Do not delay I realize your question was posted 12 hours ago so perhaps youve already seen a medical professional If the symptoms have subsided you still need to seek medical attention Best wishes to you So sorry to hear youre going through this Pain in the left arm and the back is always concerning in terms of whether it could be heart related If you are a woman please read about the possible symptoms of a heart attack which can include pain in the left shoulder and back along with weakness on that side If you are a man or a woman and are experiencing any of  please get checked out by a health care provider right away Chest pain discomfort or heaviness Pain or discomfort radiating to the back jaw or throat Sweating nausea vomiting or dizziness Extreme weakness anxiety or shortness of breath Rapid or irregular heartbeats Now all that said its also possible youre suffering from a pinched nerve or muscle strain Nonetheless if the pain persists gets worse or if you begin experiencing other symptoms please see a health care provider as soon as possible Im sorry youre going through this Few things hurt as much as back pain Just to clarify Xrays look for injuries of the bone and surrounding tissue In other words an Xray of your back could provide a preliminary indication of a fractured vertebra or a herniated disk In your case the Xray showed no injuries of this type which is great news Back pain isnt always caused by injury to the spine or spinal nerves In fact a major source of back pain is actually muscle spasm Back spasms can cause very severe pain I suspect this may be what youre experiencing If the pain went away when you were on light duty and then returned when you went back to your regular duties it may indicate you are not using correct  You should pay close attention to your posture as you lift and bend Always avoid bending and twisting as the spine is not made to accommodate this type of movement You also may benefit from  These exercises combined with stretching can strengthen your back muscles and make them more supple This will help alleviate back pain from overuse And dont forget your core strengthening your abdominal muscles helps relieve back pain and improves posture If the pain continues go back to the doctor and ask about physical therapy to help you strengthen your back and core As a last resort you might consider antispasmodic medications However those can make you drowsy and have other side effects Wishing you well Im not sure if youre talking about surgery or some other type of treatment But since I know about surgery Ill answer regarding that thats caused by compression on a nerve root by something like a herniated disc can be effectively treated with surgery In this type of surgery the doctor often removes the disc and replaces it with a spacer and a small piece of donated bone that will cause the vertebrae to fuse together after a period of time However there are several different types of that are used to treat low back pain You and your doctor will work together to determine what the best treatment plan is for your low back pain Its important to note you may still experience pain even after surgery to decompress the spinal column in the lower back Im not sure if thats the information you were after but I hope it helps Im so sorry youre going through this Back pain isnt fun and its nothing to fool around with When a Marine or former Marine tell me he has barely controlled back pain this tells me he needs to see a doctor Many back conditions could cause the symptoms youre describing from a displaced disk to a cracked vertebra The only way to find out for sure whats going on is to get a physical examination and some testing like Xrays or MRI done Back problems rarely get better on their own so the sooner you get this treated the better I wish you all the best with this First let me say Im sorry to hear you or someone you love is suffering from lung cancer Thats a difficult diagnosis to cope with Its not uncommon to suffer from back pain due to lung cancer Please talk to your cancer doctor about the medication options available to you to relieve this pain Narcotic medications ranging from pills to patches may be prescribed for severe pain related to cancer On your own you might try a heating pad set to low for about 20 minutes at a time Do not place the heating pad directly against the skin because you could get burned Instead place a towel between the heating pad and your skin If that doesnt work you also may try an icepack Again no more than 20 minutes at a time and never directly touching the skin Sometimes the combination of heat and ice helps relieve pain The best solution is to speak with your cancer doctor about how to deal with this If the back pain is a new symptom your health care provider may want to run further tests to determine whats causing it Best wishes to you First thank you for being there when so many people needed you As everyone else ran away from the disaster you ran it  and that makes you special Second Im so sorry you had to go through all the horrors of that day and I hope you have received appropriate medical and psychological care in the years that have passed I always answer is it possible questions this way Anything is possible The better question is How likely is it In the case of kidney cancer not very likely The most common type of kidney cancer is called renal cell carcinoma and it accounts for only about 3 of all adult cancers diagnosed each year Thats pretty rare To survive 10 years with an undiagnosed case would be unheard of Many of the symptoms you describe would not be associated with kidney cancer I hope this knowledge serves to ease your mind as opposed to making you wonder what else could be causing these things There is so much we do not know regarding the health issues of first responders to the 911 incident Could your symptoms be caused by conditions at the WTC that day Maybe Could the symptoms be totally unrelated to 911 Maybe Your best bet is to seek continuing care from a single provider who can track your health across the lifespan Only through diligent followup and reporting can you hope to pinpoint the causes of the symptoms you describe Wishing you peace and wellness I would suggest you get this checked out by your primary care provider Lower back pain in at the time of a bowel movement can represent two unrelated issues for example maybe the back pain is caused by straining due to constipation but it can also be a sign of other conditions including prostate problems or endometriosis I dont know if youre a man or woman so Im covering both bases Also start taking a good look at your stools bowel movements and note what they look like In other words are they soft and brown Black Oily Loose Your health care provider will want this information to help diagnose the problem quicker I hope youre able to get this figured out soon since it sounds like its having a negative impact on your everyday life I am not and MD nurse or spokesperson just a person who had been in pain the majority of the last 6 months after a fall in which nothing was broken this time I have been using OTC over the counter medicines daily Nothing worked for more than two days in a row I did some research on the medical marijuana and the CBD that is produced I took to the web to search for anything that might help I found Hemp Oil which is legal and nonnarcotic Ive been taken this for less than a week and I feel fantastic I can actually walk without any pain Today is my 5th day taken the capsule and I was able to hang up laundry outside today And yesterday I was able to go shopping without the pain I hope this helps In 1947 Methadone was introduced as a medication capable of treating pain but also as an effective component in addiction treatment Although Methadone is an opiate similar to Vicodin OxyContin and Morphine it is different in that when it is used it competes with and blocks other opiates at the opioid receptors in the brain and central nervous system Methadone prevents those drugs from becoming effective In addiction treatment Methadone works by tricking the brain and preventing withdrawal symptoms when other opiate use is discontinued Another component is that Methadone will stay active in the body for nearly 60 hours As with other opiate use chronic use of Methadone can lead to tolerance dependency and addiction Increasing the dose due to tolerance puts the individual at risk for overdose Gallus Detox Center is a private inpatient detox facility that specializes in IV therapy medical detox If you have questions about our facility or detox method please call us at 8553386929 There arent any drug interactions with taking Percocet oxycodone and acetaminophen and Ambien zolpidem together However oxycodone and zolpidem both work on the central nervous system and have an additive side effect of drowsiness and impairment of activities One should be very cautious of taking both medications together The additive products alone can be dangerous Due to the side effects the drowsiness and impairment can be covering up the symptoms and not aiding in treatment of the condition Work with your healthcare provider if both these medications are required on a regular basis No matter the frequency informing your providerpharmacist about the selfuse of any medications is important in order to safely treat your conditions and to find the root cause of symptoms I get mine done every 2 weeks I was told that 2 weeks is the minimum that you can get them done because depending on the type that your getting some need to have time to build up in your system and others take a few days in order to take full effect Hello there I would suggest taking a pregnancy test I know that you can have a light pink display if you are pregnant and dizziness However it could be that you are just late Im very regular too However things can effect your period such as stress or if you live with another female or have a close friend your cycles will shift closer to theirs mostly by a week Are you trying to get pregnant Just curious Let us know how it turns out I worked at hospital as a Patient Advocate for 13yrs and spent a lot of time in the ERs witnessing the Ortho surgeons frustration from their patients delay in getting xrays and proper treatment all because of that old adage If you can move it it isnt broken That is only partially true Could be Fibromyalgia There are medications for this I have it myself and know the pain very well Please see your Dr soon You should see your physician and he or she should order an MRI You may have a herniated disk which is extremely painful This will not show up on an xray and can only be detected when you have an MRI Theres a good possibility that your posture is causing your back pain What I would suggest to you is decompressing the back You can do this with back pain exercises I would suggest visiting httpwwwdoctorspainreliefsystemscom Theres a few videos that will show you how to properly perform these back pain exercises Sitting for long periods of a time can result in the back pain If you can get up and stretch a little during the prolong hours of sitting its going to help you relieve your pain a little Youre always welcome to read more Hope this helps Hi The pain that you have comes from aging but it is wired that you cant stand up straight but anyway the first thing that you should do is get a medical checkup from your doctor and let himher do an xray on you to see what is going on with your back And heshe should give you a medication for back pain You can try the Tylenol EXTRA strength That is really good for migraine headaches and back pain So go see your doctor and tell himher that you want to do an xray scan Everybody is right and you can also take the Tylenol extra strength I dont want to question anything but did you know that sitting too much can lead to physical inactivity and obesity and death So check in with a doctor and heshe should give you a medication for back pain or if not then you can get Tylenol extra strength Unfortunately this is a very common scenario MRIs are very sensitive and not specific This means that they often find all kinds of things that may or may not be related to the pain So if the study was truly normal the chances that it missed something that is serious or a clear cut cause of your pain is very unikely If you have not already had a consult with a spine specialist having one now to review your case and your MRI may be reasonable However do not be surprised if he or she is unable to give you a clear cause of your pain Only about 10 of the time can we look at any type of xray or MRI and say with certainty that something is the cause of back pain Even in 2010 we do not have a test where a flashing red light goes off at the site of the pain As such many times the focus has to shift from finding the source of the pain to coming to grips with the pain If you have had pain for a year the statistics unfortunately suggest that you will continue to have pain for sometime maybe indefinitely The goal may have to become to minimize your pain and to maximize your function I can try to reassure you by saying that the pain is not like the pain of a hot stove on your hand The pain is not burning or damaging your back to it is okay to try and be as active as you can even if it causes some pain Sorry to paint such a grim picture but I believe in being honest and to the point Having realistic expectations can help you move forward I hope things do improve even if the pain does not go away completely hip injuries stress or hyperextended over used muscles try an anti inflammatory pain reliever Yes   Codeine and hydrocodone can be very harsh on the stomach And a lot of people complain that it makes their stomach upset and that they dont feel right and that it contains a lot of pain in their stomach just alone If you have ulcers it definitely will probably be something that you would not want to use Because of the fact that you already have some type of irritation to your stomach So thats where you have to work with your physician on figuring out what might be some other alternatives There may be some pain medications that arent as harsh on the stomach that could be used In the case of using Tylenol thats okay But to be honest with you for severe back pain we might need to find out a little bit more And as the pharmacist I might actually ask this patient what other medications are they on Are they seeing a specialist Have they had scans done of an MRI or a CAT Scan to find out what is really causing the problems And based on that figuring out what medications may be appropriate working with their other physicians healthcare providers coming together and figuring out what might be the best treatments for this patient is probably the best answer I would really like to ask how you feel and if this is taking care of the pain If you are still is pain have you spoken to your doctor or health care provider to let them know You should not take more than what was prescribed What we are finding out is that pain therapy has to be individualized and that is why its important to let your doctor or health care provider know if you are still experiencing pain  they may need to adjust your medications It is fine to take the naproxen and Robaxin together because they work differently to treat pain This is a good question that you can always ask your pharmacist You can be on both of these medications at the same time I would recommend staying home if possible when you take your Relpax with the Norco so you can see how they make you feel it may be hard to distinguish between the possible side effects and a migraine Make sure that you carry a personal medication list that has all of your medications including overthecounter medications and make sure you show that list to your pharmacist doctor and other health care providers As a pharmacist I have to ask who prescribed the pain medication and did they know you were pregnant Many motherstobe experience back pain when they are pregnant Vicodin is a pregnancy Category C drug which means we do not have data necessary to determine if it is OK or not I would call your doctor immediately and advise him if he was not the physician who wrote for the Vicodin in the first place When using a drug like Vicodin the risks and benefits have to be weighed If you have any questions about safe medications to use during pregnancy ask your pharmacist We are the medication experts Most beds tend to conform to your body not really supporting the spinal chord I would say a very soft bed can be detrimental while a firm bed would be better Hard to tell and also depends on your body type if you are overweight etc I have not started taking the Chantix yet but the medication that I received from the Pfizer Patient Assistance Foundation has 3 bottles of blue pills and I keep reading the posted direction attached to the medication reading information such as Day 1 to Day 3 White tablet 05 mg what other possible antibiotics are used for this Methadone is used both for treating pain and for treating narcotic addiction In order to prescribe it to treat addiction the physician must have special certification from the DEA Drug Enforcement Administration However any licensed physician may prescribe methadone to treat pain Methadone is a very effective drug for treating chronic pain However it has unique characteristics that separate it from the other pain pills which has prompted warnings from the FDA The FDA has noted that the pain relief from methadone lasts about 48 hours but the drugs elimination from the body is much slower taking up to a week This means that if you rapidly increase your methadone dose the methadone can accumulate in the body with the risk of stopping breathing Further methadone is associated with abnormalities in heart rhythm potentially leading to death In addition the breakdown of methadone in the liver is very complex and interactions with the metabolism of other drugs can lead to changes in the blood level of both the methadone and the other drugs Finally methadone is secreted in breast milk and can be passed on to nursing infants I was told yes that its normal for a couple days after gallbladder removal Mild back pain will often resolve on its own without seeing a doctor However if the pain doesnt start getting better after a day or two call your doctor If its slowly getting better but you still have pain after a couple of weeks call your doctor as you may need treatment to help it resolve If youre having any other symptoms with your back pain including chest pain or the pain is severe youre unable to move part of your body or you have weakness tingling or numbness in an arm or leg see your doctor In other words if you just have mild to moderate back pain no other symptoms and you can relate it to a specific injury it should resolve on its own Of course any time youre concerned about any symptoms at all call your doctor Heres information on how to treat back pain at home  You definitely should see your doctor The shortness of breath is a concern and you dont want to ignore that In addition your lack of bowel movements and change in size of stool is also something that should be checked by your doctor I would go ahead and make an appointment so you can get to the bottom of whats happening i would call here obgyn and schedule an app I used to have terrible back pain and now none Four things I did not sure which one worked the most but probably a combination of all 4 Hi Yes its possible to be pregnant and have short 3 day periods

horrible horrible pain in my lower back which can be mistaken for sciatica but Im pretty sure it was my SI Joint With my second one week after conception pre pregnancy test I started feeling my back in that spot I told my husband I was pregnant and he didnt believe me but sure enough LOL BTW icing my back helped Not an expert just saying maybe lay flat on your back with your knees up a bit propped on a couple pillows or something to relieve some of the pressure off your lower back until you can get help Had bad stomach and Back pain at the same time with a loose stool with blood in it but the stomach and back pain was severe not hurting right now though First of all are you flatfooted If so you may want to consider getting orthopedic inserts for your feet If not you may just need to change the type of shoe or boot youre wearing Another thing to try is to lay flat on a hard surface for at least 2 hrs this will allow your lower back to relax and should alleviate some of the pain You might also consider changing the type of mattress you use If you have had unprotected sex before your symptoms started its possible you may have a STD The real question is what type of back pain are you having Is it constant or intermittent If it comes and goes you may be having contractions and should contact your physician If it is constant then it most likely is related to nerve impingement related to the pregnancy Exercise is a very good idea You may want to take a warm bath keeping the water temperature less than 104 degrees preferably around 100 This may be relieving Depending on what the pain is your physician can possibly provide you with ideas on how to better handle the problem There are different exercises alternative type of therapies and there are safe medications that can be used to help as well Adderall is a powerful stimulant  the same as methamphetaminesspeed  and can mostdefinitely cause anxiety reaction and agitation It does not typically cause back pain etc so other sources need to be medicallyinvestigated Your doctor may need to try you on a different medication for your ADD or whatever reason you are taking the Adderall httpwwwwebmdcomdrugsdrug63163AdderallOralaspx Having a UTI  especially one that is under appropriate treatment  would not prevent you from using a hot tub However since you are having back pain which may or may not be related to your UTI you should consult your medical provider to make sure you are on the correct antibiotic Hopefully you had a urine culture taken that would answer that question NO it is normal It is time for you to see a back specialist and get a diagnostic workup perhaps including an MRI There can be many possible causes Back pain isnt just for older people I dont knowI have no way of examining you or ordering any diagnostic tests but it could be sciatic nerve compression perhaps due to a bad or degenerative disc You need an MRI and a visit to a back specialist Whether she wants to go or not is irrelevant She NEEDS to go because she is having signs of a urinary tract infection perhaps one that is involving the kidney like a pyleonephritis She could also be passing a kidney stone Either one of these could be serious so waiting is not a logical option As you know it is not normal to pee blood hematuria Since the kidneys are located high in the back it would be in her best interest to seek medical care so she can be properly diagnosed and treated It may be up to use to convince here You will need to specifically ask this question to your medical provider  someone who knows the details of your medical history It would be impossible to diagnose you blindly over the Internet without a thorough medical history review of your test results and a handson examination Just because your current medical providers have not been able to find the cause of your symptoms does not mean that another specialist will come to the same conclusion Get a second opinion from another specialist neurologist or neurosurgeon Viral gastroenteritis is very prevalent this time of year Please keep in mind that this is just a blind guess since I have no way of examining you The most important thing is FLUID REPLACEMENT You must stay wellhydrated Dont eat very much for a few more daysmost of these viral infections resolve in about 710 days so hang in there At least you are not vomiting so be greatful In my practice we do not treat diarrhea with drugs at least at this stage but your doctor may have other ideas Your stomach pain may be cramps or gas but if you are concerned the only way that you can be sure is to see your medical provider so you can be examined I feel that you should be MEDICALLY diagnosed first a chiropractic assessment is not sufficient Before any home treatment of back pain that has lasted a month it would be wise for you to see a back specialist MD and have some diagnostic tests first There are plenty of exercises and stretching regimes but getting a definitive diagnosis is the most important thing first There can be but keep in mind that a person can have more than one medical problem going on at the same time so your symptoms may be unrelated See your medical provider so this can be properly evaluated There are no set rulesevery person every UTI every treatment regime etc is uniquely different It is even possible that your lowback pain is unrelated to your UTI Since I do not know anything about you your medical history details of your UTI it would not be possible to specifically comment about your particular case My advice would be for you to contact your medical provider  the person who is currently treating you and familiar with your case Since you are still having symptoms it is likely you will need to be reexamined and perhaps have some additional diagnostic tests to make sure your UTI has indeed resolved Those medications are chemically compatible to be taken at the same time assuming you currently have clinical indications to take BOTH It is never a good idea to selfprescribe an antibiotic left over from a previous infection It would not be likely that any vaginal yeast infection would cause right lower back pain Are you sure it is just a kidney infection and not a kidney STONE You may need a CT scan of your kidneys to be sure Keflex is an appropriate drug assuming the pathogen causing your infection has been identified and is sensitive to this drug Find out about your urine culture report IF you are still having severe pain you most definitely need to consult the medical provider who is treating you Yesyou can just stop taking Advil ibuprofen There will be no health consequences Why would you want to swtich to plain aspirin Aspirin can have more sideeffects than ibuprofen depending on your dose and how you use it so it would be wise to run this by your medical provider  someon who knos your medical history Many offices have policies that they can only give HIV results in person You did not say you were tested but you should be testednot once but several times over the next year just to be sure If you had unprotected sex with someone who is HIV positive you were most likely exposed It is not possible to determine individual risk based on this one or more sexual encounters so this is why you need to be tested a few times and start using condoms They can use it if it seems to help but it is NOT going to cause them to loose weightor loose weight just in the belly The fact they are exercising and eating better is the KEY to weight loss not belly wraps If you are sexually involved and NOT using any form of effective birth control there is always a possibility that you could be pregnant Just having lower back pain or bloating is not a definitive sign of pregnancy and is really irrelavant if you are more concerned about the possibility of pregnancy See your medical provider so you can be properly examined and find the reason for you back pain or bloating and the very least get a pregnancy test Yes should go er now I hope feel better soon Ive had several series of injections in my back and it helps all pain in the back as well as the leg As long as the doctor know where to inject the steroid I had the same symptoms and took several pregnancy tests they all came back negtive I went to my doctors and they did a urine test that came back negative After that they did a blood test and it came back positive and I had a miscarriage at 7 weeks So yes it is possible you are pregnant Yes I suffer from chronic infections Find a good urologist He She can run tests and figure out what is going on They will come up with a treatment plan to fit your needs and determine the reason you are getting UTIs and how to best treat it Ok you need to go to the doctor asap It could be caused by a number of intestinal problems 2yrs ago my mother was diagnosed with colon cancer She described it as a period out of her butt I doubt it would be that But it is very important You dont want to wait when it comes to bloody stool Dont panic or anything but it needs to be seen about STRAIN OR HERNIATED DISC I WOULD DEFINITELY GET AN MRI OR SCAN SOON Hi I have Rheumatoid Arthritus I feel that way all the time and also feel an achyness all the time But I think you should go see a Rheumatologist and he can tell weather you have Osteoarthritus or RA Or even if your doctor does xrays and blood tests they can tell I hope you get better soon Tamara I had severe low back pain from November 2011 until May 2012 I went to a doctor and had xrays I was put on anti inflammatories and muscle relaxants After 4 weeks and no improvement I had an MRI It revealed that I had a herniated disc on L4 with 30 of my spinal space full of disc material I tried physical therapy and while it helped I was not back to normal I had a microdiscectomy in May Good by pain hello my life back I was in the hospital for six hours I was up and walking that day One week later I could walk a mile I now lift weights hike and exercise on a regular basis Best thing I ever did for my back which was originally injured 30 years ago I would love to help you and Im certain many others on this forum would too It would be extremely helpful if you could have someone assist you with rewriting your question everything you have had done including surgeries and tests and all the things you have tried so far to alleviate your pain One thing I think I understood is that you had a fusion surgery in your back Is your pain at the surgical site When did you have your surgery I wish all the best for you Hello I have been through your same problemsIt is not a comfortable situation When I had this problem I went to my Family MDFirst he did a urine testwell this was all it took to figure out that I had a very bad bladder infectionBladder infections can cause nauseaback painleakageburning when you urinateand some pelvic painIn my opinion I would go see my Drbut until you can get into the Dr I would not drink any sodasany caffinealcoholor anything with high acid  things like OJDrink Lots Of WaterBut I would go to the store and get some Cranberry Juice or in the pharmacy in the Vitamins section there is a Cranberry Pill that is a Very High Concentrated Cranberry Oilwhich helps to clean your urinary tract One of these the juice or the pills will help you out a lotJust follow the instuctions on the back of the bottle of pills or if you are going to drink the juiceI would drink 46 ounces 4 times a dayuntil you see the DrInfo from someone who has been through thisI take Cranberry Pills everyday nowI have not had as many problems with this anymore and I strated taking the pills this about 3 years ago If you do start thismake sure to talk to your Dr about it when you see him for your appointment Good Luck To YouI hope this helps you and anyone else that may read thisGod Bless Youre most likely pregnant Get a home pregnancy test As a patient and a nurse with a long history of back pain from degenerative disc disease and other pathology I have had similar pain Since your pain is unrelated to a sudden onset from an injury or strain then you might want to explore possible kidney concerns If your urine is foul smelling than it can very easily be a that may have been caused from an untreated or from I would get to a clinic or urgent care center get a urine culture and an xray or ultra sound looking for stones There are also other conditions that need to be ruled out a well Good luck Lower back pain is sometimes treated wtih anesthetic or corticosteriod injections shots Here is some information on how this works Ive taken both for a while now and they are ok But everyone is different so as long as your doctor says its ok then trust them Hope you feel better Most big problems start of as small problems that you dont address Treat back pain as a symptom of dysfunction not a cause The cause of back pain is rarely at the site of the pain Most people have slight postural imperfections which end up causing pain in other parts of their body Postural imperfections are magnified by such things as slouching over the computer holding the phone between ear and shoulder and by hand and foot dominance in the sports most regularly played Its not the chair its how you sit in it If muscles are not getting stronger theyre getting weaker httpwwwelswickchiropracticcom A typical chiropractic clinic or center offers services that care for patients experiencing pain or discomfort in musculoskeletal regions namely the back neck head arms and legs While chiropractors focus more on treating said conditions they also diagnose the cause of the pain and recommend a short medium or longterm program to address the same depending on the nature and gravity of the patients condition Some chiropractors also offer onsite or home services for patients who can no longer travel to their clinic Still other chiropractors set up a free consultation hotline where they respond to chiropracticrelated queries from individuals Yes I am being treated for them now That is the way they started for me several years ago It dependson a scale of one to ten how much does it hurt Does resting it icing it or taking NSAIDs such as ibuprofen ease your discomfort Curious also whether youre experiencing an inhibited range of motion in your spine If you feel the pain radiating down your leg into your foot it could be sciatica which should certainly be treated You can read up on it here httpwwwncbinlmnihgovpubmedhealthPMH0001706 Most of the time the knot is a boil or a cyst that got inflamed with dirt sweat and clogged poresSometimes this will cause painpulling because there is a core that attaches to muscleGo to urgent care or the hospital asap because it will need to lanced and drained follwed by antibiotics I would say yes go to the er get checked out It could be just a pulled muscle or any number of things also depends what you did before pain started A phlebolith is a small local usually rounded calcification within a vein These are very common in the veins of the lower part of the pelvis and they are generally of no clinical importance Phleboliths are masses clots or growths that develop in the wall of a vein and are composed of calcium or lime They are stationary and harmless but can indicate the presence of

sure any chiropractor would work I had back surgery It had been broken in 4 places and almost severed Sometimes I have sharp pains like your having My Dr said it was from my nerves reconnecting That is what i would say if you have nerve damage I would definitely go see a doctor There are so many things that this could be based on your age your normal cycle etc but the bottom line is you havent had your period in over two months If it was me Id want to understand medically what that is all about From what Ive read symptoms include lower back pain stomach pain and vomiting Most people with gallstones do not have symptoms Gallstones most frequently make their presence known when they become lodged in one of the ducts that carry bile a digestive juice from the liver to the small intestine When such an obstruction occurs you might experience the following Severe and sudden pain in the upper right abdomen and possibly extending to the upper back Fever and shivering Severe nausea and vomiting Jaundice yellowing of the skin or eyes Clay colored stools or dark urine And here is an article httpwwwwebmdcomdigestivedisordersunderstandinggallstonessymptoms I hope you feel better Not sure if this is helpful or not but I have a friend who has GERD and this is a symptom he has I found this link that goes into more detail  but you might consider what you are eating while you are trying to figure out what this might be httpwwwwebmdcomheartburngerdguideunderstandinggerdsymptoms Paleolithic men and women did not have sprung bedframes cushioned easy chairs soft mattresses or pillows Many people around the world still do not have them either What damage are we doing to our bodies structurally and otherwise when we sleep and sit on modern furniture and is it realistic to think that returning to hard surfaces could reverse some of the damage done I am thinking of possibly throwing out my bed or at the very least trying to sleep on the floor I have scoliosis and my husband has back problems and I have read evidence which says the floor is the way to go but sometimes I think I am being slightly crazy wanting to do this I JUST FOUND OUT ALSO HAVE ARTHRITIS OF THE

MEDICNE REALLY HELPS IM 66YRS OLD LOVE DOING YARD WORK JUST NEED TO TAKE MY TIME NOW If you have insurance you need to have your doctor order a MRI Insurance needs to approve these due to how expensive MRIs are You may have a herniation a slipped disc or it could just be muscle spasm If over the counter pain relievers do not help you may need a painkiller or a muscle relaxer If you have no insurance go to the ER and get help There are emergency payment aids for people with no insurance I hope this helped I just saw the second half of your post sorry Go to the ER If you have no insurance there are emergency payment aids that would cost you nothing You may not get an MRI done but it sounds to me like muscle spasms Good news is that muscle relaxers are cheap Bad news is they will make you sleepy and no way you should drink on them if youre a drinker If its not spasms start asking around for good doctors who will work with your insurance situation You will make a lot of calls before you find the right one but dont give up Theyre out there I promise I would wait a few more days and see if you get your period If you cant wait then get an early response test The further from your period due date the less certain your results will be Try waiting to test at the most 2 days before your expected period The date that you had sex is around when you probably ovulated so you could be pregnant Only time will tell good luck Its honestly a 5050 shot but when my period was late I was having the worse pain ever in my lower back because my body was preparing my uterus for the period I say if you do not start in about a week take another test I dont know More than likely a pulled or torn muscle If so you may have the pain for a week or two weeks However if you continue to have the pain I would see your family Dr or an Orthopedic Dr as you will never know if it is a disc problem without an Xray I have had many bladder infections in my life and one time i let one go and slacked on taking my meds my dr prescribed me and it ended up turing into a kindey infection Which cause horrible lower back pain and pains in my abdomen I would look into that sometimea just making sure your

your doctor I have my own problems with lower back pain and it took me asking the right questions and not dealing with a doctor that wasnt willing to help To find out 3 months later I have a genetic issue and it caused me to break my backThe bigger reason to see the doctor is that I just lost a very dear friend that didnt think doctors new a thing and after dealing with so many visits to the chiro we got her to the doctor It was too late as she had bone cancer and it wasnt found soon enough She suffered a lot as do all of us that wish we would have forced her sooner The right doctor is out there you just have to be willing to do the work to find them wellwe cant be sure for ur pregnancyu may be or may not be it should be good if u ll tke a test after next 10 dayssome times due to climate change periods came latenothing to be worried Steroids have lowered my immune system and I have caught colds in the past while taking them Also I rarely get sick at all My answer to you would be yes No according to depoprovera cl side effect information that i found u can look it up wwwrxlistcom hope this helps DO pregnancy confirmation testYou will knowFuture you have drugs to avoid pregnancy doubts if you take precautionary drug Loin pain is usually due to kidney problemsInvestigate for liver disease also Dont know I have never heard of back pain causing heart problems If you are having that much problems I am surprised the doctors havent tried to make you more comfortable and done XRays on your back Also a chiropractor can help with that if you are out of alignmentBetter than drugs NO just go to a chiropractor if youre lucky it will be easily diagnoseable it depends does your doctor say you have osteoporosis yeah yeah i know it sounds like an old peoples thing but just ask your doctor anything is possible which side is crampy and has the back pain Left side usually signals possibly kidney stone or kidney infection and right side could be an appendix problem I would see your PCP or OBGYN STAT Sometimes when they do a lumbar puncture it can cause some of the spinal fluid to leak a bitI know it happened to me and it caused me to have a headache for about a week afterwards I just treated it as best I could and eventually the symptoms went away However if youre still suffering after a week I would go to your regular doctornot the ER Tell him what you had done and let him know what symptoms youre still experiencing That way he can see what the results are from your previous tests and maybe order more accordingly Good luck I have had a lot of back pain since I had gotten an epidural and the pain is usually in the general area where I received the shotthats just my own experience I have suffered with chronic back pain for over 20 yrs Yes I would see a doctor There can be many reasons for back pain and if you are constantly taking over the counter medicines you can actually cause additional harm to your body I made that mistake years ago and messed up my liver I just wanted to add that I did not get injured in any way that would have caused this We have to stand in derby stance which is basically a squat position and do crossovers It seems the crossovers are what really hurt my leg Im guessing with all the weight mainly on the left side If I go the other direction its only the left leg that still hurts not the right Ive asked

regular physician they can handle your needs or refer you to someone who can The baby could be sittinglaying on your siatic nerve Its nothing to be worried about its completely normal to have back pains and it can be more on one side or another just because the baby can be laying on one side more than the other If the baby is laying more in your back it can cause it but with it being more than the other I bout gurantee that the baby is just laying on that side more which heshe could be laying on the siatic nerve which can be painful I have had 4 so I know the feeling Hope you get feeling better If youre on any medication for anything sometimes different meds can cause seizures in some people I would see a neurologist if you havent yet If I may ask what were the test done on like the back or brain Hi I Gave birth to my daughter at 32 weeks pregnant What i was recomended to do is Lay on your left side and drink a glass of waterIf the pain persists or worsens I would strongly suggest going to the hospital to be evaluated However if you have already lost your mucus plug I wouldnt take any chances because when that happens the onset of labor should take place within 2448 hours I however did not and i ended up waking up later that night because my water had broken Hope this helps some no dont seem to have any back pain see a Chiropractora MD will only waste your money and give out drugsa good Chiro will make the proper diagnosis without drugsI had samething I went to mine todayits was how I sit while on laptop that made a disc go out she fixed it quicksounds like your wife has a pinched nerve lower back pain and front left pelvic area painIn the mornings hard to stand and walk urinating uncontrolled  neck pain leftsideafter walking around pain is lessbut not gonehard to stand up every morning drinking water it go right threw Icant make it to the bathroomwithout urine running down my legs No I believe it makes back pain much worse For me anyway  yes in a short and simple answer its very possible  when u say it was early how early because if u had sex in your ovulation time its possible ur having a baby if not then it possible that the sex brought on some bleeding  i would wait a good week and take a test  and try to be awear of your body if u notice differences then it can lead more to u being pregnant if not it possible u had some breakthough bleeding its normal to sometimes bleed early  was it heavy or light brownish  the back pain n cramping are also signs of implantion  the embro sticking to ur uerus if ur hoping for a baby i wish u luck n it sounds to me like u may b having one of not i hope everything ok  hope this helped u yes its always possible if you had unprotected sex  and your late you could be  they say its not always a sure thing to take a hpt the first day of your peroid  tests like clear blue are normaly on the money  cramping can be from the egg attaching itself inside you  i would say try another test in a few days see what that tells you if still a neg call you gyn and let her know and im sure she can tell you if its something to worry about  also bare in mind that if you did have sex and your having pain in your side you could be having a tube pregnancy which means the egg has attached itself to you tube rather than making its way into where it belongs and that can be a very bad thing  so like i siad hold off a few days but if the pain worsens call your doctor asap  hope this helps Yesit can cause pressure on nerves and cause pain It may just be that you need to change your mattress I would recommend going to a chiropractor I had a similar problem about a year ago and went to my chiropractor He took an Xray and found that my lower disc had not formed properly I lift weights and over the years it had taken its toll The disc had slipped causing extreme pain in my lower back that would shift on occasion from left to right He treated me for a couple weeks and realigned the disc No cure for me other than surgery so I have just cut back on lifting heavy and changed some of my exercises Have you tried kicking him out They say if you love someone set them free and see what happens In his case youre just giving him back to mother nature for diagnosis No Also RELATED to the above question I have not had a period since before my last pregnancy which has been 18 months with no period and no signs whatsoever of having a period or that it is coming could it be radiculopathy Before I had my pump installed I was on 500 mg Kadian  which is a form of morphine and had already been on many other opiates before that My pain pump implanted in my abdomen with tubing going up my spine and ultimately in to my brain has been pumping 10 mg of morphine during a 24 hour period for five years Withdrawals from the pump has kicked me down If I had to do this again I would insist I go to some type of rehab because I dont think coming off an opiate should be done without a lot of help from a doctor Ive had two children and that pain doesnt compare to the pain Im going through now from Morphine withdrawals Drinks lots of water and get a doctors help or help from a rehab center No I had pain for over a decade Hard getting out of bed and going to bed Cold weather and dampness increases it My PCP recommended I move to Floridawarmer climate Sounds great but really UghhhhDoctors didnt know what else to do with me Jokingly I replied just take me out to the pasture and shoot me I felt helpless I felt no one believed me Very frustrating Been thru so many tests lots of xrays blood work etc The most reliable test would be an MRI and nerve conduction tests Not happy with the dx but I have Fibromyalgiasomething that is not easily detected or believed by med providers It is
