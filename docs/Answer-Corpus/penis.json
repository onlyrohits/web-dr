{"text": "If you have had surgery near your penis I would say yes If you have medical insurance see your primary care physician first they will need to refer you to a specialist so that the insurance

lotion can contain alcohol and other drying chemicals and some of these substances can cause dermatitis or allergic reactions Keep in mind too that a lotion is actually meant to be absorbed so it doesnt really do the trick as a lube Youre better off using a waterbased personal lubricant meant for the purpose and you can follow up when youre done by washing and then applying a penis health creme health professionals recommend Man1 Man Oil to soothe moisturize and rejuvenate the skin Hi there Could Be Infection Contact A Doctor Hey this is the original poster Thank you everyone for your answers The problem still persists but I am waiting for health insurance to kick in before I go to a doctor and check it out Although its not as bad as it used to be Thank you for your answer Dr Moser I have been trying to find a trustworthy and reliable place for me to submit a picture of my symptom and somebody recommended me to webmd Would it be possible for me to submit an image of my condition to you privately Perhaps it would better assist in understanding what may be causing this dryness Being healthy with good circulation diet energy etc do play a role Could be side effect of drugs or medications youre on if youre taking any Could be something more complicated too which you have to go to urologist They are pretty cool and get questions like that all the time Vitamin E might help It has been said to work Otherwise urologist have meds that help Im sure youve seen the commercials A nusance but not a daunting problem Could be your mood too I have had phases of superhyped to nothinhappenin back and forth throughout the years Sometimes its the chick Wait it out Try a health kick Maybe vitamin E If it doesnt go away then see someone but dont freak out An erect penis of 3 inches or less may be classified as a anatomical disorder An erect penis larger than 3 inches may still be perceived by the individual as being too small In those cases perception may be reality for the man despite telling them that their size is within normal limits Growing the size of penis is not possible while increasing the size slightly may be possible There are only a few verifiable methods to increase both the length and girth size of a penis Claims by manufactures of pills and pumps typically have disappointing and temporary results at best In most cases any increase will be limited to one 1 inch or less in length or widening and may come with some side effects The most effective methods to widen and lengthen the penis include losing weight liposuction of surrounding penile areas and surgical intervention through cutting of a ligament One must make a decision if that additional one 1 inch or less of size is worth the investment of time money surgical cutting and

but its not injected into the penis Peyronies disease is a condition that leads to deformities of the shaft of the penis A curved penis or lumpsnodules along the shaft is often what is seen on exam And so you may want to see your urologist Its more common that you think Men who dont engage in sex may not realize that the deformitieslumps exist since this is often not seen in a flaccid penis In some men this condition can cause pain difficulty with sex and erectile dysfunction While genetics and trauma have some association to Peyronies disease the exact cause of this condition is not known There are medications to treat the symptoms associated with the condition These include medications or surgery in severe cases Angel I only once had some mild peeling or flaking and it turned out that my wife had a yeast infection The flaking was on the shaft not the glans and went away I dont think the water would be a factor between the US and Canada The glans of my penis also circumcised stopped looking smooth after I started having sex I wouldnt say the skin looked cracked and dry so much as wrinkled and faded So I tried putting baby oil Vaseline or whatever lotion was around on after a shower but nothing ever reversed the wrinkling Ive always wondered if that would have happened if I hadnt been circumcised I suffered from this condition off and on for years Then it went away I stopped eating breads white starches and added sugar Look it up It works I have lost 48 lbs in the process as well Every time I want a pizza I think about what it used to be like before I stopped eating bread I dont eat pizza anymore and have a fantastic time 1 No 2 Lubrcation minimizes the risk if the condom broke it would have broke completely  think of how rubber breaks All I am going to say is that you should not be having sex with anybody outside of your wife Maybe that is divine intervention trying to let you know and could be the root of your problem Do not listen to those that tell you about those exercises like jelqing See a Urologist it may be tough for you but you have to do it It is your life You are young and do not know I was like that I am 22 Now I am still young but now I know and I tell you if someone told me what I tell you I would have done things differently Urologist said exercise is bad do not do anything until a Urologist tells you All of these online people are not professionals and cannot see your situation Peyronies Disease is different for everybody and you need certain cures only meant for you Whatever you do do not fall for the peoples own knowledge You need a professional Also Jesus Christ heals Read into Gods word for healing Search God and Healing online Isaiah 535 But he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed Jesus Christ already took our bad things that we did and now He will heal us Believe and go out and get healed Do your part and go to a Urologist and find out more do not just stop there Trust me I will do the sameTree means The Cross Crucifix where He was crucified 1 Peter 224 Who his own self bore our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sins should live to righteousness by whose stripes you were healed God is with you and go do your part and He is already doing it Go to a Urologist and ask him you want to see a specialist in Peyronies Disease You can find out where they have clinics TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE AND TO PUT YOUR MIND  EASE GET YOURSELF TESTED WHEN MY EX WAS HAVING PROBLEMS WITH HIS MANHOOD HE GOT TESTED AND UNFORTUNATELY HE HAD IT ALTHOUGH THERES NO CURE DOCTORS CAN PRESCRIPE MEDICINE TO EASE UP ON SOME OF THE SYMPTOMS every doctor and everytime i got to the sexual health center they say its nothing and i have a anxiety problem i look at the internet for Std symptoms and stuff doctors say not to do that but im still scared and worried  Please help Though I may not be a health expert I really doubt you can break your penis due to the fact that there is no bone located there it is cartilage yes you can injure it while its erect but I dont think the pain would remain a permanent thing Some disorders that affect the penis include priapism Peyronies disease balanitis phimosis paraphimosis and penile cancer Most research studies have found that the average erect penis size is between 5 and 6 inches so you are larger than average in length There are very few scientifically tested methods of enlargement Yes there are surgical options but they are not all considered safe and effective and they carry risks including scar tissue formation which can result in erectile pain and even shortening of the erect penis The Andropenis device has some encouraging data that suggest it may be used for enlargement However there are no very long term safety data on its use and it does require extensive use  worn daily under clothes for hours each day and for months in total to see any benefit at all If you have an extremely small erect penis say an inch or two then some doctors may recommend surgery if its important to you but most often doctors and therapists suggest becoming good at sex in other ways eg oral sex finger stimulation being an emotionally exciting or available lover Some women prefer to be with a man who has an average size penis 56 inches or smaller penis particularly if they experience genital pain or dont lubricate well or have a smaller than average vagina Bigger is definitely not always considered to be better If you have questions about enlargement or penis size or health please check in with a urologist But Peyronies is unusual in young people Its fairly unusual in general And if your BF is at a young age the doctor is more likely to suspect some vigorous masturbation is or did cause some irritation that is occasionally triggering some pain as a tiny injury gets triggered when you move something the wrong way Like a little hitch in your shoulder from moving something wrong everything is fine until you move it just the wrong way and then you get a shooting pain Im not saying that he doesnt has an infection Its unlikely he and doctor will know exactly what the source is even after investigating unless its very obvious Riding a bicycle regularly doing strenuous exercise not drinking enough water lots of things can contribute to tiny injuries in your urogenital system that can feel like a stabbing pain when they get irritated by another activity Of course no pain is normal and its good that you both are willing to figure out whats wrong What Im trying to encourage you to do is to pursue a resolution without any wait and see breaks Because in some circumstances waiting makes the situation worse and harder to resolve I dont want you to fall into that mode of inactivity where you create more of a problem by not following up promptly A hernia is usually in the abdomen area This sounds like a case for your family doctor I had a similar problem I went to a urologist for an evaluation His PA gave me a thorough exam She said that there was no problem with my penis or testicles that she could feel The urologist suggested that if got worst there may be options He said as long as it is working and no pain is encountered just let nature take it course for now I would also like to indicate that I only started havin these symptoms after I looked them and started worrying about Also just talked to the girl she said she was clean This happened to me a few days ago Have your problems resolved How long did it take if so Can you get an erection now Actually your girl can get pregnant even though youre pulling out ejaculating and then cleaning off your penis Men emit seminal fluid prior to ejaculation and this fluid can contain sperm  which can fertilize an egg if one is present Withdrawal pulling out is not considered an effective form of birth control If you desire to avoid pregnancy and also sexually transmitted diseases you should consider using a condom whenever you have sex Used correctly a condom is a very effective form of birth control See this article on  Hope this helps Yowie That sounds painful even to meand Im a girl In terms of sterility I doubt this accident would impact your ability to father children The  so to speak of the seminal fluid that contains sperm The actual sperm which are the key to fertility are formed in the testes testicles and stored in the epididymis Depending on the severity of the injury I suppose its possible you could have damaged a critical reproductive structure such as the vas deferens in your accident Its not too late to have your injury evaluated A competent urologist can examine you and run some tests to check the number of viable sperm in your ejaculate This will tell you if youre fertile or not Hope this helps The short answer is Yes Unfortunately you have exposed yourself to  It doesnt matter that the cold sore was scabbed over or that the lip lesion barely touched your penis A person with herpes can spread the virus even when its not active Your girlfriends herpes most definitely was active since she had a lesion This does not mean you positively will develop genital herpes but youre flirting with disaster You need to take better precautions in the future There is no cure for genital herpes If you do develop genital herpes you absolutely must disclose the fact to your partners before you have sex with them They have a right to decide whether or not to risk getting the virus from you And while condom use is good be aware a condom wont necessarily protect you from herpes because the virus can reside in groin areas that arent covered by the sheath Im not sure how old you are but you may want to read about the rise in genital herpes transmission among US teens due to having oral sex with an infected partner Even if youre not a teenager the same scenario applies to your story Please stop engaging in unsafe sex Always use a condom Dont have any type of sexual relations with a person who obviously has a virus that can become a sexually transmitted disease You owe it to yourself and your sexual partners to be responsible about your sexual practices Wishing you well This is a vexing problem for postmenopausal women Im sorry youre going through it While hormone therapy often estrogen cream delivered directly to the vaginal tissue is usually recommended to help with the dryness and atrophy shrinking of the vagina after menopause other options are available Assuming youre not allergic to any of the ingredients you could try an overthecounter vaginal moisturizer such as Replens brand This is not the same thing as lubricant used during sex A vaginal moisturizer works to keep delicate vaginal tissues moist and supple At least thats the theory I dont know about the science behind it but it probably cant hurt There are several brands of vaginal moisturizers on the market An oldfashioned method to maintain vaginal tissue health is the boric acid suppository Ask your gynecologist about this You can have boric acid suppositories prepared at a compounding pharmacy They work to help moisturize and maintain the pH of vaginal tissue Most important dont give up Keep talking to your gynecologist about the problem because new products and strategies for dealing with vaginal dryness are constantly being developed Wishing you well Im sorry to hear youre going through this Your symptoms definitely deserve to be checked out by your health care provider Any time a person develops a symptom like widespread loss of sensation to a body area its a good idea to get examined You can start with your primary care provider or whoever treated your UTIs Because your UTI cleared up over a month ago I wouldnt think your symptom is some weird side effect of antibiotics And I dont think antiperspirant use would cause loss of sensation either though if youre spraying it directly on your groin area you could try stopping that to see if sensation improves At any rate Id recommend you make an appointment with your health care provider for an exam Best wishes to you Im sorry to hear youre going through this How unpleasant Id recommend you have this situation checked out by a doctor If youre scratching something is causing you to itch And you need to find out what is causing the itching It could be something simple like a fungal infection   But then again it could be some type of  While youre waiting for your appointment with a health care provider its very important you Do not have sex even with a condom Do not scratch the affected areas Wash your hands frequently To ease the itching feeling you probably are safe to wash the affected areas gently with warm soapy water and thoroughly dry them You may find it helpful to soak in a tub of warm water with an oatmeal bath Assuming youre not allergic to any medications you might try using a bland powder cornstarch or talc to keep the area dry until you can get a diagnosis from the doctor I wish you all the best I think you should get this looked at Whatever is causing the problem its not normal You may want to gently inspect the position of the  It should naturally cover the head of the penis the glans You should never pull the foreskin back on a boy younger than about age 5 not even to clean At age 2 you can easily damage your sons penis by forcibly retracting pulling back the foreskin At any rate a red swollen painful penis in a child is not something to take lightly Id suggest you put a call in to his pediatrician as soon as possible Best wishes to you both Ouch That must be uncomfortable I suggest you get this checked out by your primary care physician or other healthcare provider as soon as possible What youre experiencing clearly isnt normal and you dont want to take any chances with your reproductive health If you experience any of the following symptoms seek immediate medical attention because these are the signs of  Sudden severe pain of the testiclesscrotum sack Enlargement of a testicle Swelling of the scrotum sack Tenderness of one or both testicles With luck your primary care provider can tell you whats going on and treat it if necessary Please dont feel embarrassed to speak with a medical professional about this issue Trust me we deal with situations like this all the time in a respectful way We want to make sure you get the care you deserve Best wishes I would advise you to ask the doctor Honestly you have a completely valid question there and the doctor not only will give you advice specific to your situation but may change the method of wound closure to accommodate your needs if he knows this in advance Theres no way to estimate whether or not it will be safe for you to have sex a week after your surgery because many different factors come into play the exact location of the mole the size of the incision condom usage etc Please dont feel shy about asking your doctor about this Trust me he will take your question seriously Wishing you well Im sorry to hear youre feeling anxious about your and how it might affect your sexual performance And I want to assure you your feelings are perfectly normal I think all men go through a period of insecurity regarding their penis size Society puts a lot of emphasis on this particular aspect of masculinity after all I hasten to assure you that your penis probably is perfectly normal in size But your best bet to completely set your mind at ease about the situation is to make an appointment with a urologist He or she can examine you and tell you if everythings OK Also you may be surprised to learn that medically speaking penis size isnt measured based on the erect organ Rather penis size is measured by stretched penis length The article I linked above will give you a lot of information about average penis length how to measure your penis and when to see a doctor I hope this helps set your mind at ease Thats an excellent question You do want to take care during intercourse if you have significant curvature of the penis Have you been evaluated by a health care provider for this Some curvature of the penis during erection is normal However too much curvature can be a sign of  which is caused by scar tissue within the erectile tissue of the penis Peyronies is not caused by cancer nor does it contribute to an increased risk of cancer It also is not caused by a sexually transmitted disease Whether or not you have Peyronies disease if you have significant curvature of the penis you probably want to avoid very vigorous thrusting during sex Not only could this be painful for you it could be painful for your partner Its probably a good idea too to become familiar with sexual positions that make insertion easier and dont cause the penis to bend midshaft You dont want to experience a penile fracture Dont be embarrassed to discuss this situation with your health care provider He or she can give you specific information about what to do to avoid injuring your penis during intercourse Lets talk for a minute about how is transmitted The human immunodeficiency virus HIV spreads from person to person by direct contact with infected bodily fluids such as semen blood or vaginal fluids Any exposure to HIV results in a risk of getting the virus yourself However the exact risk of acquiring HIV from a single exposure isnt known In short its impossible to answer your question because there are too many unknown factors If you performed an unprotected no condom used penile insertion with an HIV positive individual even for just one second then you have of getting HIV yourself If your partner does not have HIV then you have no risk of getting HIV because the virus can only be acquired from direct exposure to infected bodily fluids That said its never a good idea to have unprotected sex whether anally or vaginally because many other sexually transmitted diseases STDs exist and can be spread in this way Especially if youre having sex with multiple partners youre always welladvised to use a condom  for your own protection and your partners Im sorry to hear your dad is going through this It sounds frightening I would not jump to an immediate diagnosis of cancer While this unexpected bleeding certainly should be investigated by a health care professional there could be many causes for this bleeding that have nothing to do with cancer That said I would suggest your dad see a health care provider as soon as possible Any time a person develops a new symptom such as bleeding its worth getting it checked out Hope this helps Wishing your dad all the best Its probably time to say Welcome to  It sounds like everything is normal to me When you enter puberty a cascade of hormones begins flooding through your body These hormones cause you to develop body hair and they also will cause your penis to become larger The testicles also increase in size And yes sometimes these things happen with startling quickness That seems to be the case with you Please dont get into a habit of measuring your penis Every guy on the planet gets worried about his penis size Is it too small Let me tell you there is a wide range of normal penis sizes Yours sounds within the normal range and its probably not done developing yet Another thing Eventually  youll be ready to use that penis to have sex Please remember to always practice safe sex Use a condom even if the girl youre with tells you shes on birth control Condoms protect you and your partner from a wide variety of sexually transmitted diseases At 12 years old youre nowhere near ready for sex But a little information now may help you later right If you cant talk to your parents about puberty sex and all the physical and emotional changes youre going through try to find a trusted adult maybe a friends dad athletic coach pastor or school counselor to confide in Its good to talk to someone who can tell you everythings going to be OK Wishing you well Could be nothing a blocked pore or something Or it could be something Genital lesions can be signs of a sexually transmitted disease or another condition Id suggest you have this looked at by a medical provider By the way its rarely a good idea to squeeze or pop any sort of skin lesion When you do that you create a hole in the skin that can allow infectious bacteria to enter You especially dont want that to happen on your penis All the best to you Let me set your mind at ease Your penis size sounds pretty normal Of course it depends on how you measured This WebMD article   explains exactly how to measure your penis and gives some statistics about average penis size Most men do not measure their penis length correctly so you may be in for a pleasant surprise if you remeasure after reading this article Even if your penis size comes up short let me assure you that while many men care about penis size many women dont care about it at all For women the loving intimate relationship she has with a man is far more important than the size of his sexual organ Take care Im neither a guy nor a urologist but one thing I feel pretty confident saying is this circumcised or not masturbation shouldnt hurt or sting uncomfortably Of course the penis always swells when its aroused The swelling causes the penis to stay erect for penetration during sexual intercourse If thats the type of swelling youre talking about then its perfectly normal If youre implying you experience an abnormal swelling other than a normal erection then thats worth investigating I suggest you see a urologist to explain whats going on and find out if what youre experiencing is normal or is something that needs to be addressed Do not feel embarrassed consulting a urologist They deal with questions like yours every day and will respond in a respectful and dignified way You have a legitimate concern after all Take care Great question I guess Im assuming first of all that youve seen a health care provider and had this condition diagnosed Fordyce spots known medically as angiokeratoma of Fordyce can be confused with genital warts or vice versa so you should get a professional opinion to make sure you really have Fordyce spots Fordyce spots are small pale painless white or red bumps that occur not only on the penis and scrotum in women on the labia but also can be seen around the vermilion border of the lips and even inside the lips They are very common and entirely benign in other words they do not cause harm Fordyce spots are considered a cosmetic problem not a disease to be cured The only way to clear them up is with laser treatments and even this is controversial Most physicians do not recommend treating Fordyce spots I would not recommend using triamcinolone cream on your penis Triamcinolone cream is a corticosteroid that is normally used to treat conditions such as eczema and contact dermatitis Not only will triamcinolone help clear up your Fordyce spots but it could be harmful Corticosteroid use on the penis can cause thinning of the skin which could lead to injury Obviously you want to avoid that If you have not actually been diagnosed with Fordyce spots please consult a health care provider If you have been properly diagnosed try not to let the appearance of your penis bother you As I said this condition is very very common among both men and women Hope this helps Youre a good grandpa to notice this and be concerned Id suggest the boys parents speak to their pediatrician about this Several conditions can cause a boy to have a sideways stream like that A couple of possible reasons that come to mind which Im including for informational purposes and as examples only include urethral polyps and meatal stenosis Both of these are treatable The boys pediatrician should be able to investigate this situation further and arrive at a diagnosis and appropriate treatment Again good for you for noticing this and calling attention to it I wish you and your grandson all the best I suggest you seek immediate medical attention It sounds like youre describing  which is a prolonged erection not caused by sexual stimulation In priapism blood gets trapped within the penis causing it to remain erect If this isnt treated quickly it can cause permanent damage You may have heard this on commercials but if you ever experience an erection lasting longer than 4 hours seek medical attention This condition does not result only from the use of drugs for erectile dysfunction It can occur in any healthy man Take care I do all of the above except i dont find it very tight gripped you are probably not pregnant if there was no ejaculation no sperm could have fertilized your egg to result in pregnancy it doesnt matter if you we ovulating or not Another person made contract the testosterone Hey this happened to me before I seen a doctor and he said its from 3 things 1 not showing enough 2 sweating 3 its kinda weird when he told me but he says its also from Jerking offto much  It could be any of the things that you mention including a yeast or bacterial infection or even an STD  but thats something that only a trip to the doctor can reveal My guess from the limited information available is that it is likely to be a skin irritation of some sort which can occur for a number of reasons If it is a skin irritation using a first rate penis health cream health professionals recommend Man1 Man Oil should help Look for one that includes a first rate emollient like shea butter as well as a powerful antioxidant like alpha lipoic acid Good luck There arent any drugs or medications that will really cause the penis to grow its a genetic issue Im afraid But the good news is that most men do not really need any greater size in order to sexually satisfy a partner while a large penis can be initially impressive what is ultimately much more important is a mans skill with using his tool Learning how to use your penis to provide ultimate satisfaction  to both him and his partners  is usually more fruitful than concentrating on size issues Keeping the penis healthy is also important so use a quality penis nutrient cream health professionals recommend Man1 Man Oil One with vitamin A among its ingredients can also help eliminate penis odor which is often a turnoff to partners Only a doctor can say for sure but from what youve said it sounds like some form of dermatological irritation If that is the case try using a top notch penis health cream health professionals recommend Man1 Man Oil Look for one that includes a high end emollient like she abutter to soothe the irritated skin and help moisturize the skin Good luck Theres no way to know for sure without going to a doctor so if you want a definitive answer that is what you need to do It does sound like you are probably experiencing a simply skin reaction very common on the penis Common skin irritations often respond to a top notch penis nutrient cream health professionals recommend Man1 Man Oil Look for a cream that includes a natural emollient like shea butter Good luck If you do have sex while you are still experiencing a yeast infection make sure that you use a condom however its often best to try to wait until the yeast infection is gone just to reduce the risk of spreading it It also can sometimes be a little sore on the penis when the yeast infection is in full power Make sure you maintain proper overall penis health by using a quality penis nutrient cream health professionals recommend Man1 Man Oil Look for one that includes a superior antioxidant like alpha lipoic acid Good luck  Its possible that the penis pain youre experiencing may not be related to the back surgery sometimes things happen coincidentally However since you did first notice it postsurgery bring this up with your doctor and see if there is anything that might account for this You may also want to check with your urologist and explain what is going on On a different note for general penis health use a quality penis nutrient formula health professionals recommend Man1 Man Oil with a range of vitamins including A B5 and E  I dont blame you for wantin to be cautious but for what its worth Ive been using it the Man1 Man Oil I mean for a few months and it does a great job for me A friend told me I should use it thats how I found out about it My doctor says I have really sensitive skin on my member and it can get real dried out and scaly and stuffm but not since I been using this Go for it This is something you should discuss with your doctor but it sounds like you may just need to give the medicine time to work Sometimes prostatitis can linger for a long time and take several weeks to go away Checking in with your doctor can give you an idea of if he or she thinks that the medicine is working or if there may be a need to change the treatment On a different note do keep an eye on your general penis health through the use of a penis nutrient cream health professionals recommend Man1 Man Oil One with vitamin A has the added benefit of fighting unwanted penis odor Good luck This is usually caused by the female pushing down with her vagina  which also by the way is what causes female ejaculation to occur It happens when the female pushes down with her vagina as she does in childbirth This is what is known as female ejaculation  or as No Hard put it female squirting During sex pushing down will bring on a big rush of feeling like a whoooosh Porn is only detrimental to your health when watched excessively I seriously doubt your taking this will stunt the growth of your penis You could always pull up the medication on line and get a full list of all the side effects it causes This can be done privately with no embarrassment to you at all Many young teens have been on medications of this type for years now and it is very common to prescribe these drugs to children with Adhd These medicatons have now been on the market for so very many years and I would think by now you would have heard if that was in fact one of the side effects of this medication or other similar type medications I can certainly understand your concern however and I know at 16 yrs of age this is a very sensitive scary thing for you to consider I would suggest you simply ask your doctor and you can of course do that but I suspect you are a bit embarrassed to bring up the subject with your physicianalthough you have no reason to be I do understand that most likely it is not something you want to discuss openly with anyone So I suggest you look up the medication on line and get a complete list of any and all side effects You can do this from the privacy of your home with your computer or you can simply go to your pharmacy and tell them you want a complete detailed printout of all side effects that could result from taking your medicine They will be happy to provide you with a copy of any and all side effects without asking you any questions at all as to why you want a copy of this I feel after you have read all the side effects in privacy and see that stunting the growth of your penis is not one of them you will feel much better You are too young to have this worry on your mind when it can easily be taken care of discreetly and privately Good luck to you Sure the size of his testicles does not mean anything If anything I wish my testicles were somewhat smaller Mine are pretty big and I dont like it they get in the way often when I lay on my side But I do like feeling how big they are Anyways dont worry about the size of his testicles If his penis size pleases you the testicle size shouldnt even matter It doesnt have anything to do with being a virgin or not its just how he was made One question were his testicles shriveled up due to him being cold Maybe his testicles are normal sized but they shrunk because of cold airwater Again no need to worry about the size and I wouldnt ask him about it if someone questioned me for having a small penistesticles I would be hurt What makes you think theyre small Have you seen bigger ones before As youve been able to get so close to them I suspect he isnt going to be allowed to remain a virgin much longer so please be careful Youll need protection from disease and pregnancy After you look after the matter of protection I think youll find the size of the testicles has nothing to do with the performance of the penis Sometimes theyre not even equal in size for example the left being small and the right being large but it doesnt matter I dont think it is something you need to ask him about Just think about how youd feel if he asked why your breasts werent as large or as small as whatever he thought was normal It is intended to increase arousal but everyone is different He should be careful and sensitive to what youre actually feeling Perhaps you need to use a waterbased lubricant as well I dont think a stroke would be the causeit could be the way you are different people get erections quicker than others while others slowerwhen you masturbait think about the women you like doing it for you that may train you when you see her to get an erectionare you masturbating properly I have a similar issue How didis your problem developing Have you regained the ability to achieve an erection You need to go see a doctorThink about it this way if you are worried about it enough to ask here then YOU SHOULD WORRY You need to go see a doctorThink about it this way if you are worried about it enough to ask here THEN YOU SHOULD WORRY Just because he rubbed against you and didnt ejaculate does not mean you cant get pregnant If there is precum there is a chance for pregnancy If you are late on your period by 2 days you can test for pregnancy A simple urine test will tell you if you are pregnant or not You have signs and symptoms of a couple of different things When did you have your last pap smear Or have you ever had one How old are you If this persists for more than 1 week take a test if it is negative go see the gynecologist and have them just do a pelvic exam and pap smear just in case It is just routine This way all bases no pun intended are covered Plus you will have peace of mind Good Luck I dont think you can fix that Now to the other answer yes you can break your penis Its when you rip the muscle It may not be a bone but you can break your penis Ive heard a doctor tell a patient that its real hard to though there is no such thing as small vagina or big penis unless it is very extreme a small vagina is one which cant allow the insertion of two fingers try inserting a clean finger into vagina and gradually increase it to two fingers stretch it slightly There are several possible conditions that can cause lesions on the penis similar to those you are describing It is important that you see a doctor for an examination to find out for sure what is causing the lesions Infection is one possibility Genital herpes can cause blisters and ulcers that are usually in a cluster Syphilis can cause a lesion that is typically described as a painless ulcer Condyloma caused by the HPV virus can cause raised lesions and plaques Molluscum contagiosum caused by a virus can cause raised lesions There are several common noninfectious conditions that can cause lesions on the penis These include lichen sclerosus lichen planus and pearly penile papules among others Studies do not show that saw palmetto reduces prostatitis symptoms Saw palmetto has been shown in some small studies to help symptoms caused by an enlarged prostate benign prostatic hyperplasia These symptoms include weak urine stream and frequent urination There are other studies that do not show that saw palmetto is an effective treatment for these symptoms Prostatitis is sometimes but not always caused by an infection Often treatment will consist of several weeks to months of antibiotic therapy if it thought to be a result of infection Its good that you are seeing a Urologist for evaluation and treatment Your doctor should also be able to recommend treatment for your pain if you are not already taking pain medication httpmenwebmdcomtcprostatitistreatmentoverview Hi it sounds like lichens planus Not sure of spelling For itching try an oral antihistamine non drowsy Hope this helps I suffer with a lot of derm issues Also maybe a womens over the counter anti cream vagisil might bring some relief  The kind of swelling youre describing doesnt sound typical to me at a guess Id say it may mean that you have an infection That doesnt necessary mean an STI BTW  it can be a typical gardenvariety infection But make an appointment to see a urologist so he or she can assess it live and in person and let you know how it should be treated Too many men decide to just ignore things like this because theyre embarrassed but keeping an eye on penis health is really important Guys need to check themselves out every day just to see if there are any changes that might indicate something It also can help to use a good penis nutrient cream health professionals recommend Man1 Man Oil regularly One with vitamin A can also help to fight penis odor a common problem for many men Good luck  When worried about an STI its always a good idea to go see an actual live doctor fro an examination advice from chat rooms and forums is good but you want to always be SURE when talking about an STI On a separate note keeping your penis in good overall health through the use of a penis health crme with vitamins and amino acids is a good idea Good luck  Seeing a doctor is necessary for a definitive answer It may very well be a skin issue simply related to accumulation of dirt sweat etc or to a reaction to soap laundry detergent etc If that is the case one thing that may help is to regularly use a quality penis health cream health professionals recommend Man1 Man Oil after washing So dude it might be something like acne or just Fordyce spots or one of those other things that just happen My tool used to be a minefield of skin issues but yeha I use Man1 Man Oil a great penis health cream and it really does the trick for me so try it out yourself and see Good luck guy  Making sure youre not using strong soap or detergent is important for me using a really good penis health cream has been a lifesaver I use Man1 Man Oil and it has lots of great ingredients that really do the job for me So heres the scoop from my own experience Im guessing youre on the steroid because of a doctor right If not  check with your doc man So ask him first about the penis But I know from my own experience that using a steroid cream PLUS a penis health cream I use Man1 Man Oil to really good effect is a plus it took care of all the skin problems I was having so do it and see Im not a big cycler but Ive heard this happens a lot to guys because of the seat and pressure and all that From my own experiences my tool has been numbed from beating it too hard and I used Man1 Man Oil on it because that helps get the circulation going in the area so definitely give iut a go worked for me So heres the thing its not unusual for a guys tool to have different colors thats just part of being a tool But if you use a really good penis health cream like Man1 Man Oil that can help to even out skin tone even better it helps make the penis skin look good and healthy Mine looks amazing nowadays  Ive even had a girl compliment me on how good it looks  So a good health cream should be a benefit when youre working on the foreskin its not something helps the stretching itself but it should help relieve the soreness that can sometimes result until the skin gets loosened and can help protect the skin itself which is important I use Man1 Man Oil which really moisturizes my tool and makes it feel a lot better when its overused  Yep definitely try that Ive been through some of this stuff too and one of the reasons I use Man1 Man Oil is because of the vitamin E that vitamin is supposed to do wonders for skin and I also think that using that cream is a big help for my overall penis health It sure looks and feels a lot better  Yep supposed to and does Im a guy that spends a lot of time with his tool  and Id rather have my hand down my pants for fun instead of because Im constantly scratching but I used to have a penis that itched like mad I finally got around to trying Man1 Man Oil and have had no complaints since Go for it  Yep Im a big wanker myself  when Im in the mood I can go for hours and get pretty rough handling going on so Ive been in the same boat myself My tool had gotten really dulled in feeling so I started using man1 Man Oil and now its great  its livelier and really responds better to the touch and really great So yeah definitely get some and try it yourself You dont wanna mess around with losing sensation in your equipment  Dude I hear you  but ya gotta use them Theyre way too important not to So here try this  use polyurethane condoms and see if that makes a difference Also m ake sure you use something like Man1 Man Oil I use it and it keeps my tool itchfree which is kinda amazing considering how my tool used to be  Yep Im a big wanker myself  when Im in the mood I can go for hours and get pretty rough handling going on so Ive been in the same boat myself My tool had gotten really dulled in feeling so I started using man1 Man Oil and now its great

healthwise and boy did it get all wrinkled and ugly so I know what youre talking about bro Yeah Man1 Man Oil is really good for that its got all sorts of stuff in it that helps with dry skin wrinkled

that the infection is gone  those are nasty Ive used Man1 Man Oil on my flaky member and it works really great for me My penis used to be kind of embarrassing at least when it was in one of its flaky stages but now I dont have to worry about that which is a real relief I hear you bro Im a bigtime wanker myself why not right and I used to get a really numb knob after whacking too much Try what I did which is using Man1 Man Oil it has something in its one of those ingredients with a name you cant pronounce that helps make the tool sensitivie again Really works  That is really rough dude  I feel for you I can tell you that I used to have lost sensitivity in my tool due to the fact that I really go to town on my tool when masturbating I use Man1 Man Oil which has an ingredient in it Acetyl L carnitine which is real helpful for sensitivity restoring Good luck and keep going Way definitely a good idea And use the one called Man1 Man Oil which is what I use and my dick has never been in better shape My tool is way sensitive to any changes like soap or detergent but it has given me no probs since I started using this stuff  its awesome  I use it every day because I tend to get really dry cracked skin Since I started using Man1 Man Oil my skin has been smooth and moist and my whole tool looks and feels a lot better  no more pain from it being chafed  OK I can identify with your bf  I have a hard time keeping my hands off myself And yeah I get really really sore sometimes and raw skin and all but Ive been using Man1 Man Oil for a while now and it really helps me A tool

it a lot even though no other guys seemed to get it like I did at least thats what they claimed  not like I did a personal check on it But yeah for me using Man1 Man Oil really helps keep the smegma at bay Ive been using it for a while now daily and its cleared things up great for me so yeah try it  Ok I think were talking smegma here What your bf needs to do is get that Man1 and start using it

pimples on my pole too and its not like I dont wash a lot I also have gotten a lot of rashes and dry skin on my tool so I did start using Man1 Man Oil and things really got cleared up for me What you may have are Fordyce spots which are harmless but it helps to keep your tool moisturized My advice is to get some and use itxmlnamespace prefix  o ns  urnschemasmicrosoftcomofficeoffice opop I havent suffered the poison ivy on my pole experience Dude what the but Ive been there with the nonstop itch business before Since I staretd with Man1 Man Oil I definitely dont get that problem anymore So yeah use it I cant tell you the chances of you being pregnant as it is different for every person however traces of semen are often present in that stuff that leaks out before he ejaculates often called precum While you dont have one of your ovaries you still have the other one Assuming everything is normal with that one there is a possibility of you being pregnant If you are going to engage in any type of sexual activity where his penis comes into contact with your vagina please practice safe sex and use a condom andor get on birth control Its fallin off buddy Since supplement products like these are not regulated by the FDA like medications nor tested for safety or efficacy I really do not have any information to determine if they are safe As a pharmacist I generally steer my patients away from supplements like these because they have no proof of safety or efficacy and are usually just a big waste of money I have not started taking the Chantix yet but the medication that I received from the Pfizer Patient Assistance Foundation has 3 bottles of blue pills and I keep reading the posted direction attached to the medication reading information such as Day 1 to Day 3 White tablet 05 mg Sti Without being able to examine you its impossible to tell what might be going on You should make an appointment with your doctor If your penis is changing colors and developing cracks that is something that should be checked out to determine the cause and any necessary treatment Go to the Doctor possible infection Im really not sure if only having one ovary makes you less fertile but as long as there have not been any problems since then you do have a chance of being pregnant however Precum does contain sperm wether he ejaculated in you doesnt really matter because of pre cum sperm do travel and if he was already inside then yes you can be pregnantnot likely but yes The more you stress on it it can actually make your period late just relax if youre really that worried and dont want to be pregnant not that im for abortion but you can take within the first 5 weeks 15002500 mg a day of generic cheap vitamin C look for riboflavin on the lable cause you DONT want that Vitamin C is water soluble you pee out what your body doesnt use so you cant overdose drink lots of water because it can cause constipation but within 25 days your period should return So just relax could be stress First let me say that if there was no penetration into your vagina it is unlikely your pregnant With that being said a boy does not always have to ejaculate for you to become pregnant Often times there is precum which also contains semen and can cause pregnancy if they have penetrated your hole Peeing would not clean out the semen if there was any in you The cramps may be caused by menstral cramps or possibly a side effect from the morning after pill I suggest next time using a condom or other contraceptive if you do not want to get pregnant Please remember that though other contraceptives may prevent pregnancy they may not protect against STDs Consult your doctor about the different precautions or options out there if your unsure what to use If you are still worried about wether or not your pregnant you could try a at home pregnancy pee test stick Hi His problem is personal hygiene he just needs to make sure her keep the area behind his foreskin clean every time he washs or showers and on really hot days give it that extra clean when ever he can Using and oil how stated will not do the job and any kind of will help after washing even simple baby oil or olive

the surface of the skin For the ideal final results they need to be treated in the initially six weeks or so following they kind While they are reddish or purple in colour Some of the most generally suggested treatment options for decreasing the look of stretch marks include the soon after Cocoa butter or shea butter  Those Allnatural plant oils are fairly efficient for nourishing the skin and mitigating the effects of stretching Employing those as a preventive measure may possibly be far more powerful but numerous people have reported an improvement in the look of the skin soon after employing a cream containing either cocoa or shea butter Aloe vera gel  Aloe is well recognized for its healing properties and may possibly have a useful impact on stretch marks if utilized shortly soon after they appear Vitamin E oil  Vitamin E is important to keeping the structure of the skin as well as to guarding the skin from environmental harm A lot of dermatologists advocate use of vitamin E which can be obtained in specific creams or employed straight by breaking open vitamin E capsules and rubbing in the oil Vitamin A  Vitamin A is employed for treating a variety of sorts of skin blemishes such as scarring triggered by acne injuries or stretch marks Like vitamin E vitamin A is most powerful Whilst used straight to the impacted location I think these options could be a lot cheaper than a man made up oil even mixing some together would help even better But for a start try some good old baby oil see if that helps first Do hope this helps you Good Luck Hi Yes you can HIV

and who may mistake them as an STI Men with PPP should not pick them or attempt to squeeze them as this could lead to scarring and infection It is possible to have the papules removed for cosmetic reasons which dermatologists may do by using a CO2 laser to vaporise the spots This does not involve any injections in the penis as an anaesthetic cream can be used and men will be fully healed within one to two weeks It is important to remember that despite this being a safe and effective procedure removal is not obligatory It is often opted for by people who are finding that the papules are affecting their selfconfidence Do hope this helps you Good Luck Hi See Above Answer Hi Yes there is a way Its called jelqing just go to wwwpegymcom and have a good look round the site have a read up

need to give it some time and rest To speed the healing you can Ice the inside of your thigh to reduce pain and swelling Experts recommend doing it for 2030 minutes every three to four hours for two to three days or until the pain is gone Compress your thigh using an elastic bandage or tape Take antiinflammatory painkillers  Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs  NSAIDs  like Advil Aleve or Motrin  will help with pain and swelling However these drugs can have side effects they should be used only occasionally unless your doctor specifically says otherwise Practice stretching and strengthening exercises if your doctor recommends them Most of the time these conservative treatments will do the trick But not always If these techniques still havent helped after six months you may want to think about surgery While surgery may give you relief its a last resort Not everyone can return to their previous level of activity afterward But I think it would be best to lay off sex for a couple of weeks or longer but from what your saying I would seek help from your doctor But hope this helps for now Good Luck Hi And no foreskins can do this a trip to doctor would help he may need a small op to get over this it wont hurt him but once he has had it freed just keep getting his foreskin back and teach him to do the same for cleaning it its important that he dose that have answered a few guys

syphilis  This is the earliest stage and generally occurs from 10 days to 3 months after infection It typically causes a painless ulcer on the genitals Secondary syphilis  This is the second stage of syphilis Many different symptoms can occur see later but usually last several weeks They can however come and go for up to two years Latent hidden syphilis  This occurs after the symptoms of secondary syphilis have cleared With latent syphilis you have no symptoms Latent syphilis can last for many many years It is divided into two types Early latent syphilis  This lasts for a year or so and you are still infectious  that is you can pass syphilis on to other people Late latent syphilis  About two years after secondary syphilis has cleared you can become noninfectious and are no longer able to pass syphilis on to others Tertiary syphilis  This is the final stage of syphilis It can affect many organs of the body including the brain and heart It can result in death But I dont think you have

exercises have rules if you push or rush these exercises you could end up with ED just keep to the program and your be OK Do hope this helps you Good Luck sry new at this site  I would recommend that you both be tested for herpes The most accurate way to test for herpes is with a blood test A cotton tip swab of an active blister can also be used to test for herpes Realize that herpes is not routinely tested for when you see a doctor for STD screening because it typically requires blood testing Usually just Chlamydia and Gonorrhea are tested for with a genital swab or with a urine sample It is very difficult to determine how long someone has had herpes and who had it first It is very possible that one or both of you has had the herpes virus for a long time without knowing Some people have the virus yet do not exhibit symptoms but can still transmit the infection during sexual contact It is important that you know if you test positive for the virus because if you do not have it and your partner does then you are at risk of acquiring the infection If this is the case your partner should be on antiviral suppressive therapy and should be using a condom during intercourse First off consult a doctor for a std screening Secondly one of your partners most likely one of the two who gave you a blowjob may have had a virus or infection in their mouth Could be lymph nodes Get medical advice There are excersizes that will enlarge thickness and length They do work It is a slow process but it can be done Also some of the enlargement drugs that is on the market do enlarge by increasing the blood flow and amount that the penis will tolerate Again its a slow process but it is possible There are also excersizes to allow you to last for very long time before you climax that really turns your mate on Also with time you will learn to satisify the woman and not yourself If you strive to satisify your mate she will hold on for life and do the same for you If you are lucky enough to find a virgin to marry someday God will match you perfectly Im gonna guess they are Fordyces spots Check out this link This is exactly what it looks like on my penis I freaked out too but its nothing You are gay A hidden or buried penis refers to a penile shaft that is buried below the surface of the penile skin and also to a partially or totally obscured penis There are numerous causes of a hidden or a buried penis including congenital obesity aging with an overlying fold of abdominal fat and skin a shortage of penile skin from chronic inflammation or an overly aggressive circumcision A congenital buried penis is rare It includes an abnormally large pubic fat pad and firm tissue that pulls the penis inward In addition there is a congenital lack of attachments of shaft skin to the penile shaft In a normal infant or child with congenital buried penis inadvertent removal of excess normal shaft skin during circumcision can leave a variable amount of foreskin and a shortage of shaft skin If the circumcision line is placed too far from the head of the penis normal shaft skin is removed and foreskin is left to cover the shaft Since foreskin does not have normal attachments to the deeper shaft the buried penis is created or made worse In addition the incision line can narrow upon healing further burying the penis by pushing it downward into the pubic fat Circumcision on an unrecognized buried penis can remove normal shaft skin instead of foreskin thereby worsening the situation If a second circumcision is performed on a boy or man with concealment it may complicate reconstruction by removing the remaining skin thus necessitating a skin graft If the patient has a severe buried or hidden penis the penile skin and head of the penis can become chronically irritated by chronic dampness causing discomfort This irritation can cause progressive destruction of the penile skin with further burying and constriction of the penile skin thus preventing the head from being visible A hidden penis can cause severe selfesteem issues These boys or men may not have a visible penis while standing and may have to sit to urinate A boy or young adult can be ridiculed and made to feel inadequate by siblings or friends It is not uncommon for concerned parents of a young boy to go to the pediatrician or pediatric urologist Unfortunately there is tremendous misinformation and lack of education even amongst these physicians The parents are usually told that their son will outgrow the deformity if he loses weight or when he reaches puberty Unfortunately this is untrue in most instances especially if the boy has a moderate or severe buried penis The boy is then lives with this psychologically traumatic deformity that could be corrected with a relatively noninvasive procedure The surgical correction of a buried penis depends on the abnormality However marked improvement can be achieved in almost all patients The correction is based on reestablishing the connection of the erectile chambers of the penis to the penile skin along with the removal of excess pubic fat andor skin In severe cases of buried penis in which the patient has inadequate penis skin resulting from an overly aggressive circumcision or chronic inflammation then the penis must be freed and covered with a skin graft The surgery is usually performed as an outpatient unless a skin graft is needed The improvement in penile and pubic appearance can be dramatic Equally impressive is the patients positive personality and selfesteem improvement leading to more selfconfidence and social interaction Yes you can get scabies from your partner but not IN your vagina Scabies would like appear in your genital area hands or basically any skin surface that has

working Yes some antidepressants and cardiac medications can interfere with sexual activity so please discuss this openly with your doctor since I do not know what meds are you are taking The size of your penis should not be drastically changing no more than your hands or feet getting smaller It may seem that way if you are having erectile problems This is another common male disorder that may be able to be rectified but any use of ED meds will need to be prescribed by your doctor  someone who knows your medical history the medications you are taking and can examine you You need to see your medical provider so you can have this skin lesion properly examined Many skin conditions will mimic an ingrown hair It may not have been an ingrown hair at all but a sebaceous cyst oil gland or other common penile skin lesions If your penis is important to you and I know that it is get it checked out Worried about what Penis size when erect or flaccid does is not as drastically different from person to person as you might think I have no idea where you are in your stages of puberty so my only suggestion is for you to see a sensitive medical provider for a private consultation There is really medically other than painful and expensive plastic surgery in increase the size of your penis so dont waste your time and money on any bogus supplements or devices A man is not judged by the size of their penis but rather by the size of his brain and compassionate heart If your son is urinating okay the bruised penis should heal without an lifelong problems If he is having any pain or restriction in his ability to urinate it would be good to have his medical provider examine him In the meantime cool compresses may help Every time I see a girls bike without those crossbars I often wonder why only girls especially girls who no longer where long dresses or skirts use them They are much more appropriate for boysfor this very reason Peroxide will not cure anything definitely not Chlamydia or gonorrhea so keep that appointment on Monday if you think your sexual history and symptoms justify it There is an easy urine test that can give you the correct answer Expect a lecture about using condoms The penis is covered by skin and there are about a hundred reasons for itchingfrom allergy to your laundry detergentdryer softeners or soap to eczema or a fungal infection You cannot accurately diagnose yourself over the Internet so get a medical professional invovled Please dont try and post the pictures Pictures may be worth a thousand words but if the picture of genitalia those words may not be appropriate The penis is covered by skin and the skin is capable of all kinds of skin conditions including pimples tiny sebaceous oil gland cysts folliculitis hair follicules heat rashes eczema etc Many of these little bumps are completely innocent You cannot accurately diagnose ANY skin condition based solely on a description so it is off ot your primary care or better yet a urologist  someone who specializes in the this part of the anatomy Rather than stress out over selfdiagnoses it would be best to have an answer from a medical specialist  one who can see these bumps firsthand You did the right thingyou saw a urologist for a proper examination Yes prostatitis can cause some but not all of your symptoms so please finish that course of antibiotics A person can have more than one issue going on at the same time so please keep in mind that burning on urination as well as irritated or sensitive penis tip can be a chemical sensitivity new deterrgent or dryer softener or a condition called balanitis Have you tried a topical overthecounter steroid cream Make sure to always use a condom so you will not have to worry about a sexuallytransmitted disease next time I am glad that your chlamydia and gonorrhea tests were negative but you may not be so lucky next time Yes any skincovered body surface is susceptible to a fungus but be careful of making dermatological selfdiagnosesmany skin conditions can mimic the appearance of a fungus You can try overthecounter antifungal medications to see if it helps but consider having a medical exam if you are not improving in about a week Prostatitis should not cause rednesssoreness at the tip of the penis so you are correct There is likely another cause Unfortunately it would not be possible to determine a specific cause blindly over the Internet based solely on your very brief description You will need to see your medical provider again not just because of this rednesssoreness but because you apparently have not responded to three weeks of antibiotics for your prostatitis You may want to consider seeing a urologist Then perhaps you need to go one step further and see a dermatologist It would not be possible to determine a diagnosis over the Internet based solely on a vague description Not really A penile implant is semirigid in most cases and should be sufficient for sex I dont know the type you have or how much cavernous tissue was removed in your penis to allow the implant so you need to address this question with your urologist  the person who has these answers I dont knowI have no way of seeing or examining your penis Your description is just too vague for me or any medical provider to make a blind guesslet alone a diagnosis As embarrassing as this may be for you the only way to have a definitive answer is to be examined Based on what you stated it would not be likely that you have an STD or anything serious There are many innocent skin lesions that can appear on the skin of the penis includingzits Clearly you are concerned so please get it checked out Dont do your own penis surgery That would be stupid Obviously I cant see what you are talking about but you may have a penile bridge you can look this up on the Internet or a remnant from a circumcision A penile bridge can be cut by a urologist under a local anesthetic but to do it yourself would not be in your best interest These things are common and are not awkward to discuss with your medical provider Do the right thing and see a professional Not a clue There are no anatomical connections between these two parts If one partner has active herpes the transmission to another person is possible via direct genital contact or contact by hands Not reallybut its a good thing you dont keep your money down there I think you will be safe unless she happened to have herpes on her hands called a herpetic whitlow which is not very likely All men are NOT created equal The size of a mans testiclesor feetor earsor any other body part is geneticallydetermined I have no idea if what he has is normal or not since I cannot examine him but if his doctor doesnt feel there is a problem then that is just the way he is Testicles do not increase in size after a person has sex so they are what they are Let it go Dont make him feel selfconscious It would trouble him why you were such a testiclesize expert The penis doesnt really shrink from the point of maximum penis growth age 17 believe it or not so if you are accurate in your measurement it is not due to the nortriptyline Some antidepressants can cause problems with libido or even make it more difficult to have an orgasm but it should not change the size of your penis Erections are all about blood the engorgement of blood in your penis As you may have experienced some erections are more rigid than others more blood shunted to the penis Under the right circumstances with the right attitude I suspect that that lost inch will mysteriously reappear Dont fret Obviously I have no way of examining you but one possibility would be a condylomata acumitum a venereal wart So yes this could be an STD to see your medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated First it is not possible to make an accurate diagnosis based solely on a vague description A medical provider would have to physically examine you Second before addressing treatmentsurgical removal or otherwiseone must have that definitive diagnosis Third I would NEVER recommend that anyone attempt to do surgery on their penis at home It is bad enough just getting a zipper injury See a urologist You have had this worrisome and undiagnosed penis lump for a few years so how much longer are you going to delay doing this If this is an innocent skin cyst on the shaft of your penis and properly diagnosed by a medical professional and not selfdiagnosed a cyst would not preclude you from sexual activity as long as its presence did not worry your partner These tiny cysts often sebaceous cysts can be easily removed so if they are concerning you just get the cyst taken off Herpes is transmitted by direct contact with the skin or mucous membrane It can be easily transmitted during sex but not through the ejaculate Blackheads comedones can occur on any skin surface Since the penis and scrotum are covered with skin you can certainly get them in this location Prostatitis can certainly cause those symptoms especially if your doctor examined your prostate and determined that you did indeed have this disease Please stay on your Cipro but make a follow up appointment with your urologist at the end of the course just in case Herpes tends to rear its ugly head shortly after the onset of symptoms so without the characteristic tiny painful blisters that are typical of this disease the chance that you have herpes is not very high With that said it is not normal to continue to have persistent pain at the tip of your penis so something is wrongYou may have to have some additional diagnostic tests It is not possible to determine the nature of a rash based on a vague description so you will need to see a medical provider so you can have this allover rash properly examined diagnosed and treated Since you are concerned that this could be a consequence of unprotected sex seeing a medical provider is even more important If necessary the medical provider can test you for HIV and other sexuallytransmitted diseases There are no drugs exercises or devices that will change the size of your penis so dont waste your money on unproven nostrums You can no more increase your penis size than make your hands bigger or your nose smaller It is what it is I dont know your age or penis size but many men who feel they have a smaller penis actually have a normal sized penis Talk to your medical provider As much as I would like to address your concern my worried friend there is absolutely NO WAY for me to blindly make any type of determination about this mysterious bump You have seen multiple doctors but unfortunately this medical provider cant see it to offer an opinion If this i on your skin see a dermatologist Herpes would not be high on a diagnostic list based on what you have described While it would be impossible to blindly offer you a definitive answer without examining you more likely possibilities would include chaffing like you mentioned or a fungal skin infection tinea cruris also known as jock itch  a common skin condition that occurs in warm dark moist skin areas You would need to see a medical provider if this condition persists or worsens This is really the only way to be properly diagnosed and treated No but it will look bigger when you lose the excess fat around the pubic area When you have a hard or large size stool it may milk semen from your prostate gland This would be one possible explanation for your discharge Another of course would be a prostate infection or even an sexuallytransmitted disease In order to be properly diagnosed you will need to see a medical provider so you can be properly examined I would have to see his scrotum and examine him to really make a comment so I would suggest that you bring this up to his pediatrician At age five the testicles are small and tend to be migratory can travel up higher in the scrotum rather than hang low like in a man The foreskin will automatically retract during intercourse that is the beauty of the design You need not retract it before insertion nor can you prevent it from retraction during sex If his penis is overly sensitive just slow down the process and make sure that the parts are well lubricated It will be fine The vast majority of men on this planet are uncircumcised just the way that God made them so things will be fine As far as penetration is concerned experiment with a few different positions It is likely that more than an inch is happening Erect or flaccid A five inch penis is within the normal variation range for males A man is not judged by the size of his penis but by the size of his heart The best artists tend to use smaller brushes You should not get signs of syphilis like a chancre in just two days And yes you will need a blood test to determine if you have syphilis RPR A special urine test can detect Chlamydia and gonorrhea Where you checked for herpes Guilt can cause some interesting side effects I suspect you can achieve intercourse with your wife because you are comfortable with her and marital relationships are appropriate You may be having problems having sex with someone other than you wife because you have deepdown feelings of guilt or remorse about this forbidden relationship There is not likely anything wrong medically with your penis but since your penis is controlled by your brain perhaps this is where you should focus We all possess our own sense of right and wrong so maybe your brain is trying to tell you something Maybe if you asked your wife for permission to have sex with your girlfriend things may be easieror not You will need to have your penis examined by a medical professional either your primary care medical provider or a urologist This is not an ER visit but you can go to an Urgent Care facility Try not to worry It may not be as serious as it seems but you need to have it properly checked You will need to inform your parents andor show this open area to your father In the meantime until you can see a medical provider keep the area as clean as possible and use some topical antibacterial ointment I am unclear why you were having irritation a month before this incident but bacterial or yeast infections in this area like balanitis are not uncommon It would not be possible to determine a cause or causes of your erectile difficulty blindly over the Internet We do not know anything abou you your medical history or have any way of examining you This problem can have both physical or psychological causes but you will need to see a medical provider or a urologist to solve this dilemma You have most likely treated Chlamydia effectively regardless of the location of the incident but your Herpes will last forever Anal sex has its own risks so you will need to disclose this information to your medical provider to make sure you have not contracted any other sexuallytransmitted disease like condylomata anal warts Ever heard of condoms Use em This may be normal seminal fluid from the prostate A bowel movement can milk a small amount of this fluid from the prostate gland as it passes Assuming you are not having any penile discharge associated with a sexuallytransmitted infection or have signs of prostatitis prostate infection this should not be an issue The correct and lessvulgar term for the male genitalia is penis and the answer is a remote possibility of yes since there is viable sperm present in the tiny amount of semen that can leak during sexual excitation If you were ovulating at the time there is a remote possibility of a pregnancy occurring Needless to say if you and this penisowner do not plan on having a child at this time you will be wise to cautious with your sexplay A very slim chance if any It would be a very crafty sperm to make it through several layers of clothing swim up your vagina and then impregnate you If you are having this type of risky sex play remember that it will likely progress Be proactive Use some effective birth control to be safe It could be the soap you are using in the shower or you just have atopic dermatitis a dry skin condition There are prescription creams and ointments that can be prescribed by your medical provider if your over the counter efforts are not helping Yeast can occur on the skin anywhere on the body but I would have no idea based on your description alone if yeast is an underlying culprit This problem has been going on for months now See a dermatologist or your primary care providerless expensive than moving to Canada How in the world did a classmate see her genitalia This issue should be specifically brought up to the pediatrician Many times they tend to skip the genital exam on little girls for modesty but these are the kind of things that can be missed when the physical exam is abbreviated If the pediatrician is concerned he will refer this little girl to a pediatric endocrinologist first It is not a frenulum It is called a penile bridge  a complication of your circumcision most likely Please show this to your medical provider or better yet a urologist These may be able to be surgically corrected Yes the herpes virus can be spread this wayor not A person is never sure when they are shedding the virus and the recipient would need to be susceptible at the time I think you answered your own question An old rule in life if it hurts dont do it If you have found that the redness and odor is directly related to your masturbation ritual then back off a bit What KIND of medication You may have a common case of balanitis due to yeast or even a bacterial infection but unfortunately this would take an examination to definitively determine  not something that can be accomplished over the Internet See your medical provider so you can be properly diagnosed and treated Read about Peyronies Disease This is a distinct possibility so I would suggest that you see a urologist This is not going to hurt your prostate but it may not be considered normal for this to happen You will need to see a urologist in order to be properly examined There may be a minor surgical procedure that can fix this hidden penis issue See your medical provider my worried friend This may be nothing Many men have tiny pearly papules on their penis I cannot make a diagnostic call based on a similarity to picture so you deserve a patientspecific answer Masturbation will not change the diameter or overall size of your penis Frequent ejaculation will decrease your sperm volume and sperm count but only temporarily Masturbation is considered safe but if you feel the need to masturbate 15 times per day you need to find another hobby Give it a rest my friend The penis is like any other part of the body It can become bruised inside and become sore with use If you rubbed one of your fingers like that on a regular basis I suspect you could get a sore finger As you know I cannot examine your sore penis over the Internet so if your symptoms persist you will need to have a visit with a medical provider hopefully an understanding male provider who can provide you with some confidential advice Because your penis is sore limit your masturbation a bit until your symptoms improve You can still achieve selfpleasure by being a bit more gentle with your tender part The condom can cause an irritation but so can the act of vaginal sexespecially for the first timeThe redness or swollen area at the entrance to your vagina could be from some tiny tears along your hymen assuming you still had one at the time you had sex for the first time Burning on urination could be cystitis irritation and inflammation at the opening where you pee used to be called honeymoon cystitis back in the days when the honeymoon was the first time a woman had sex or even a urinary tract infection Sexual activity can stir up a lot of germs in this area  and germs can lead to a urinary or bladder infection Germs can come from fingers mouths oral sex as well as a penis Now that you have chosen to be sexually involved you have a responsibility to make adultlike decisions when it comes to your medical care If you do have a urinary tract infection burning on urination frequency urgency or even blood when you wipe this needs to be medically evaluated A urine test will not reveal your recent sexual debut so it is really up to you whether to disclose this information A pelvic examination is not usually needed to make this diagnosisonly a simple urine test My suggestion would be for you to get checkedjust in case Women and girls of all ages can get urinary infections whether they are having sex or not Obviously infections are more common if you do have sex I am pleased that you and your partner used a condom Make sure you use them 100 of the time or urinary burning will be the least of your problems You need to see a urologist for a highlevel medical evaluation This cannot be solved over the Internet I am very sorry but a diagnosis requires an examination  not something that can be accomplished on WebMD Answers Your description is vague and the possibilities are numerous Since the penis is covered by skin and you have a dermatologist seeing this professional would be advisable An accurate diagnosis  not a blind guess  is essential to get a patientspecific treatment regime In most cases your treatment will involve a prescription medication again not something that can be provided to you online For a simple penile yeast infection balanitis you can have sex now if you use a condom and your sore penis is up to it Otherwise wait until you are symptom free I have no idea what you mean by a cyst condition and which antibiotic you are taking and for why so I would suggest you call your doctor for patientspecific advice  someone who knows the details of your case I dont really understand your question First the testicles do not store or make semen The testicles make sperm and the sperm is stored in the epididymis The prostate gland makes the semen Second abstinence from ejaculation does not increase sensitivity in the penis so I am not sure what you are asking You do realize that I have no way of examining you over the Internet A direct examination not a photo would be required by a medical professional to address your concern You would need to have a consultation with a urologist A specialist will need to see your scarring firsthand before discussing any cosmetic revisions I say cosmetic since this is not a functional anomaly and insurances are unlikely to pay a penny to make your penis look better While this may be beyond the normal requests for cosmetic surgeons who may or may not choose to due penile surgery it may be worth a consultation Without the ability to examine you I really have no way to know if you have balanitis or not Dont post a picture Uncircumcised men are more prone to balanitis caused by yeast which likes warm dark moist places but this tends to itch and become red If you are just noticing a white area just watch it for a while If it persists you would need to see your medical provider or a urologist but it sounds innocent Hopefully you are using a condom A woman gets pregnant when viable sperm meets a ripe ovum egg Typically this takes place outside the Fallopian tubesnot on the outside of your vulva Since there are millions of sperm and usually only one egg the chances are slim It would be wise to keep an uncondomed penis away from the front door in the future Notestosterone will not enlarge your penis or scrotum Due to side effects it would not be advisable to take it unless you are proven to be low in this male hormone and it was specifically prescribed by your medical provider By the way A good sex life has very little to do with penis size It is how you use it There are no penis health creams As far as the color of your penis is concerned I am at a loss to comment since there is no ability to properly examine you via the Internet a photo would NOT help either Your vague description that your penis looks freaky does not help narrow down the many dermatological possibilities that can cause skin color changes so I would suggest that you SEE a medical professional such as a dermatologist  one who can examine the skin on your penis Leave your penis alone assuming your dermatitis has resolved Allow your skin to recover without challenging it with additional creams and ointments I suspect it will return to its normal nonshiny appearance soon Isnt sex pleasurable enough without putting menthol on your penis Your partner may not like this cooling sensation either Is it harmful I suspect it is fine but I seriously doubt that the company tested this product on genitals It is usually for sore joints and muscles One can have allergic or adverse responses to ANY product that is used for something that it was not indeed to be used on so obviously your menthol days may be over This unpleasant sensation should end soon Try a little overthecounter hydrocortisone cream to relieve the inflammation I dont recommend that you perform any type of selfsurgery on your penis It doesnt cost that muchor is it that involved to have a professional do this for you painlessly and without a risk of infection When you mess with Mother Nature there is no way to predict outcome  positive or negative ones Rather than mess with your own male hormones by taking potent female hormones I would strongly suggest that you find and consult a medical professional like an endocrinologist who is experienced in sexual reassignment therapy This is NOT something you should be doing on your own I do not know your age or medical history but the urge to urinate followed by a scanty amount of urine could indicate an issue with your prostate gland you actually SIT on this gland Since you sit all day long playing video games this could be one possibility People with prostatic hypertrophy large prostates can definitely exhibit symptoms of this nature You need to see a medical provider so that you can be properly examined so get out that chair You can see a urologist or your primary care provider Since you also mentioned some sort of cyst on your penis I would suggest the urologist Maybe or you can try a different medication for erectile dysfunction ED Before adjusting your dosage it is best to discuss this with your medical provider  someone who knows you and your medical history Your medical provider may give the okay to try a higher dose to test your erectile sustainability or provide you with a trial of a different ED med to try When it comes to medication responses  ANY medication response  it often takes a trial of therapy Yes this can be surgically fixed You would need to see a urologist This would most likely be a simple office procedure to remove this extra skin if you find it to be a cosmetic issue His doctor may not be concerned he sees LOTS of penises but you are so that is sufficient to do a bit of research A little boys penis can just seem smaller due to an abundance of fat pads in this area or he could have a true hidden penis A hidden penis does have part inside so may need to be surgically freed around puberty Puberty is a time where hormonal influence causes a penis to grow to an adult size the maximum size occurs around age 17 You can easily find information on Hidden Penis with an Internet search Little boys who are on the chubby side will often havea penis that looks disproportionately smaller Since you are concerned a consultation with a pediatric urologist may offer you the reassurance you desire The specialist may pronounce him normal or if he has a true hidden penis provide you with the information you need What kind of answer my friend You do realize that a diagnosis requires an examination  not something that I can do over the Internet A description of red dots is much too vague to make a blind determination as to what you have See a medical provider for an examination You may have urethritis or even a urinary tract infection While urinary infections are rare in men it can happen You will need to see your medical provider so you can be properly examined and tested While the chance of pregnancy is small it is not zero Semen that is excreted during sexual excitation can be loaded with viable sperm There is no way to calculate your chances of getting your girlfriend pregnant by this risky sex play so you will need to sweat it out She could take a morning after pill or you can just wait until she has or misses her next period Take this experience as a serious lesson Use a condom Your girlfriend should be on some sort of birth control Andyou should NOT be engaging in sexual activity that could end up with an unintentional pregnancy No these are all basically worthless quack gimmicksdont waste your time or money Pheromones are real but as far as I know human pheromones have not been successfully tested for efficacy You really cant spray an expensive substance on your skin and expect the others to be magically attracted to you and offer themselves for unbridled sex While subtle smells are important a potential partner will likely be more attracted to a nice smile and a pleasant personality not how you smell Human pheromones are in sweat but I dont suggest that you try to attract someone with stinky body odor Ion and power bracelets are absolutely worthless Period There are no pills or vitamins that will increase the size of your penis Your penis reaches it maximum size by age 17 and there is no substance that can make your penis feet or hands bigger Many men feel their penises are smaller but in controlled studies of zillions of men the size of the penis when erect does not vary that much Devices like hanging weights on this delicate member that claim the penis can be enlarged do not work and are potentially dangerous Sexual performance is an art and the most skilled artists do not use large paintbrushes or rollers The most important sex organ is your brain If you are having unprotected sex even with someone that you assume is clean or STD free you are still at risk Many women who have Chlamydia or even gonorrhea contracted from a previous partner are not aware of it If you are now having a penile discharge not normal then it would be in YOUR best interest in finding out the reason It will also be in your partners best interest to know as well It is NOT normal to have a puslike discharge from the penis Since you are also having other unexplainable symptoms it would be wise to see a medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated  three things that cannot be accomplished over the Internet or by sitting it out You may have an issue with the erectile tissue of the penisthe corpus cavernosa which fills with blood to achieve an erection There is a condition called that you should research Dont be embarrassed by this condition but you do need to see a good urologist so that you can be properly examined and diagnosed Obviously I cant give you an exact answer since I dont know the ingredients in that body lotion I am guessing that it had some type of menthol or other chemical that resulted in some numbness I do suspect this is temporary and that your penis will return to normal soon Needless to say I hope you washed it off as soon as it became numb There is no way to calculate an individuals HIV risk from just one encounter but you did have some very risky sexunprotected open wound on penis bleeding female partner and someone whos sexual history is unknown I would strongly suggest that you see your medical provider so you can be properly examined and have STD testing especially for HIV Without the ability to see this scab firsthand please dont post a picture it would be very difficult if not impossible to offer you a patientspecific recommendation The penis is covered by skin and skin can become irritated for a variety of reasons so I would suggest that you see a medical professional to have this allimportant examination The risk of Lyme disease would depend on the TYPE of tick tiny deer ticks are the usual culprit not dog or wood ticks and if you live in an area that has a lot of Lyme cases If you had saved the tick the local health department may be able to check it for you Since I suspect you did not I would suggest that you all your local health department I dont know where you live for some better local advice or have your fiance call his medical provider You really do not enough information at this time to determine individual risk Having sex again after 12 years of inactivity can be a bit anxietyproducing for you Having unbearable pain with sex is definitely adding to this anxiety Your first and most important step is to see your gynecologist for an examination Not knowing your age vaginal dryness would be one possibility Intercourse can cause tiny little tears in your delicate vaginal tissue so these fissures could be reopening each time you attempt to have sex There can be other issues of course Dont be embarrassed to discuss this with your medical provider It is a real problem that needs a proper solution Your partners penis size is not as important as his gentleness patience and caring so you may need to postpone vaginal sex for a while until you can be properly examined and treated I am confident that this problem can be fixed and that you will soon be enjoying sex again Yes you can ask friends or other medical professionals in your area Ask who they would see if they had a urological problem You can even ask your local pharmacist You can call the local medical society but in the end you will need to choose someone that meets your needs Urinary tract infections in men are very rare STDs in men are unfortunately not rare A urinary tract infection UTI does NOT cause puss to be seeping from his penis This is most likely to be gonorrhea or the very least Chlamydia  Occasionally a man can have a penile discharge from prostatitis Tests for Chlamydia and gonorrhea can take a few days assuming the ER ordered them which I hope they did At first the urine can look like an UTI but my skeptical eyebrows are definitely high I would suspect and STD until otherwise proven by a lab test If your boyfriend is or may be having unprotected sex with others then YOU need to go and be tested A simple urine test will determine if YOU have an STD No sex or sex only with condoms until you get some definitive answers This is called  a common complication of your circumcision The ONLY way to fix this is to have it surgically corrected not something you can do at home Steroid creams often help with simple adhesions but not bridging So as soon as you get insurance go see a urologist and have it fixed permanently In most cases it is a simple office procedure under local anesthesia Are you running or exercising naked There are penile conditions that can cause this reaction but you would need to see a urologist to be properly examined Penile retraction can occur because of a ample fat pad in this area or weaker connective tissue Exactly why your penis is deciding to hide during exercise is really a mystery until you see a urologist Since this is causing your pain when you pull your penis back out from its temporary hidden position I strongly advise you to get it properly examined You have most likely wasted your money on a quackery device The penis reaches its maximum size at age 17 Not knowing your age I suspect that what you have is what you got my friend In studies after studies the size of an erect penis varies very little from man to man regardless of what information you have heardOther than expensive plastic surgery there is really no effective device that can permanently enlarge your penis I cannot tell you how to use such a device or endorse its use at all Some penis enlargers can damage the senstive tissue cause painful bruising and scar tissue You are taking a risk by using them The size of your penis is not that important it is how you use it You do not judge an artist by the size of their paint brush and the skill of a caring lover is not judged by the size of the penis First thing Get him a stool to stand on if you expect him to lift the seat and stand to pee Having a heavy toilet seat crush your penis is not a pleasant experience so he will be a bit overlycautious for a while As long as he is urinating okay no bloodno difficulty staring his stream the penis is likely fine Of course I cant see it so you need to be the judge whether he sees his medical provider or not It could have been worselike getting slammed in a door Toilet seats hurt but they are not that heavy Cold compresses could help but who really wants a cold weenie In most cases just leave it alone and make sure it is healing properly No cure other than Tincture of Time Most of these areas of pigmentation caused by skin disorders will fade over time There are no specific treatments There are a lot of torturelike devices that claim that enlargement can occur but none have been medical proven to work so dont waste your money There are no medical treatments that will increase your penis size The penis has never been known for its beauty and appearance so dont worry about the wrinkles since only you are probably the only one seeing it A sexual partner is more likely to see or experience the nonwrinkled version There are not wrinkleremovers or penislifts so it is what it is No There are not creams that can fix a wrinkled penis I would not agree that properly washed underwear would likely retain any fungus residuals Fungus can exist just about everywhere in the home  especially in warm dark or moist areas Finding the one source or sources may be difficult Have you seen a dermatologist If not this would be recommended Go directly to a urologist This is the person that should be doing the complete evaluation of your ED and loss of penile sensation You need to see a urologist This dent may be a plaque and you may be getting a condition called Peyronies Disease Please get properly examined Yesthat is EXACTLY what happens and why both men and women need the HPV vaccine before they start having sex and why couples who are not monogamous should always use a condom HPV is the main cause of cervical cancer and men with HPV are causing it Stop doing home surgery on your penis lumps before you get a secondary infection Since I cant examine you firsthand there is really no way for me to confirm or dispute the sebaceous cyst diagnosis so I would suggest that you see your primary care medical provider or a urologist for an expert opinion Cysts tend to be filled with a cheesy material unless of course they are calcified which may be the case for you Obviously I have no way of examining you or seeing this moist itchy spot firsthand please dont post a photo but it may be tinea cruris also known a jock itch a yeastfungal skin infection Fungus loves warm dark moist areas and guess what This is one of them To be professionally diagnosed you would need to see your medical provider but if you want to try some overthecounter antifungal medications your pharmacist can help choose one for you to see if it helps you may be able to skip and expensive medical visit If this area gets worse or painful or has signs of a bacterial infection pus oozing tender swelling then you will need to get medical care immediately No diet or exercise is going to help Use the betamethasone cream and manual stretching but be careful Do not keep the foreskin forcibly retracted or you may create a painful condition called paraphimosis I do not know you age but your glans should be fully retractable in your early teen years or before unless you have some adhesions tissue still attached Without an exam I cannot comment Rather than treat yourself a consultation with a good urologist now may be beneficial to you You had UNPROTECTED sex It is your other head that I am concerned about this was not a good decision Why would you not use protection against pregnancy Even if you were both virgins assuming both are honest you still have the possibility of pregnancy If your penis is sore you will need to see a medical provider so that you can be properly examined There is absolutely no way to blindly guess the reason for your symptoms based solely on your vague statement Yes Leave it alone There are natural adhesions attaching the head of the penis to the foreskin at this age Forcibly retracting the foreskin can be very painful so just clean what you can see It may be red because you are causing very tiny microtears in his foreskin Some children do have very tight foreskins so please allow the pediatrician to make that determination during an examination Most of the menboys in the world are uncircumcised just the way Nature made them As he ages those natural adhesions will resolve and his foreskin will completely retract If not there are prescription steroid creams that can be used to help it along In my pediatric practice I rarely intervene medically until age 7 or 8 unless the foreskin is supertight and it balloons when he urinates If this is the case a pediatric urologist should be consulted You will need to have your medical provider examine this area carefully Unfortunately your description is really not sufficient to make this important call Unfortunately without the ability to examine you firsthand I would not be able to determine the true nature or cause of this blister based solely on the information in your posting You will need to see your medical provider Other than plastic surgery there is no medical way to increase the size of your penisor your feetor your heador any other part of your body It is what it is so dont waste your money on quackery An artist is not judged by the size of his paint brush and a good lover is not judged by the size of his penis It would be highly unlikely for her to get pregnant in the way you described assuming you are telling the whole story You and your girlfriend are playing with fire so to speak If you keep up with this risky sexplay that tends to escalate over time there could be an unintentional pregnancy in your future If you are sexually involved it is time for you BOTH to get serious about contraception Why not use a condom when you are playing around Should your sexual practice progress and they usually do make sure that she is also using an effective contraceptive as well The only surefire contraception is abstinence and you are definitely not practicing that so be smart Talking about treatment is very premature You need to first be medically evaluated and diagnosed to determine if there is a problem and if so what would be the cause It would not be possible to blindly do this over the Internet without any medical history I dont even know your age so seeing a urologist would be an appropriate step You will need to get the specific okay from the surgeon since I do not know how many sutures you will have where the mole was located on your penis or even how fast you heal as an individual Genital herpes tends to stay in the same area with each outbreak but subsquent outbreaks may be less severe Yes it can be only on the scrotum a fact that many men who use condoms to prevent herpes find difficult to accept If you have it only on your scrotum it may not spread to the penis Washing up after sex will not wash away any semen that is deposited and entrapped in the cervical mucous  these are the sperm that have a chance of impregnation Advice is mixed about lying on your back or with a pillow under your buttocks to encourage gravity to help but it is fine to do so dont jump up and rush to the shower I dont believe the contracting your vaginal muscles will help that much for increasing your chances of conception but doing these Kegeltype exercises has some other advantages Having an intense orgasm during intercourse will help so remind your partner to be generous and considerate There is often some free bleeding during an abdominal procedure and this free blood can migrate South through the inguinal canal directly to your scrotum This could be one reason for the discoloration The swollen penis defies and easy explanation since I cant examine you and I hope that you will not try to post a picture I dont believe it is really to the catheter use There are some strange things that happen in the OR after you fall asleep so I hope that you were not accidentally traumatized by someone leaning their elbow on your junk to rest As a novice student in the operating room I once leaned my arm for an extended period on his thigh The next day when I made round to ask about his abdominal incision he said it was fine but his thigh was killing him When I was 22 I was under general anesthesia to get my wisdom teeth extracted I ended up with a huge bruise from my buttocks to my thigh I suspect I accidentally fell off of their operating table but no one said a word The mystery still haunts me During your postop visit you need to show the condition of your genitals to your surgeon for a patientspecific explanation I dont know the type of surgery you had My guess is that time will return your genitals to their normal appearance soon It may be a while before you can proudly pose nude for a magazine I hope that your surgery went well and you are now on the road to recovery No one can determine the significance of a blood clot on your penis or whatever you are seeing without a medical examination You will need to see your medical provider to make this determination Yes Your problem could be psychological or physical or perhaps even a bit of both Either way the erectile dysfunction can be easily rectified with several different medicines designed to increase and maintain blood flow engorgement to the penis If you maintain your erection longer you will not likely have any related performance anxiety so the problem could fix itself with a little blue pill You may not always need it but you may find this to be a temporary solution These require a prescription so you will need to ask your medical provider Just one failure to perform could create a feeling that it will happen again so this is where the psychological component plays a role Assuming you do not have any underlying medical issues or psychological stresses affecting your life at the moment this should get you back in the saddle again Penis massage sounds suspiciously like plain ol masturbation and no it will not enlarge or restore your penis other than getting an erection Are you doing this yourself or paying someone to do it for you If you are paying I would advise you to save your money Talk to your doctor or better yet a urologist There may be a few things that can be done to help you but you may need a few diagnostic tests If your penis is only slightly bent it will not interfere with sexual activity Without having an exact diagnosis it would be very premature to know if there was a treatment or cure you would need to be examined by a urologist first There is a condition called Peyronies disease that you can read about that involves a bend in the penis during erections I dont know if you have this particular condition or not since you have had this condition apparently from birth If your little grandson is on the chubby side the penis can be hidden by a surrounding fat pad quite common in children If you push on the fatty area around his penis and the penis seems to emerge like turtle coming out of a shell then it is probably just fine There is a medical condition called a hidden penis and another relativelyrare condition called a micropenis that you read about on an Internet search but it may be too early to know if he has any of these unlikely conditions Bringing it up to the pediatrician at his upcoming oneyear examination would be appropriate If you have an inguinal hernia get it fixed There is no reason to take the risk of having an incarcerated hernia An inguinal hernia in spite of its close proximity to your penis and testicles will NOT reduce or change your fertility Based on your vague description cellulitis would be low on the possibility list The penis is covered by skin and the skin can have multiple pimplelike bumps Unfortunately the only way you can get a definitive answer is to see a medical provider for an exam A description or even a picture just doesnt do it when it comes to determining a diagnosis and to suggest a treatment regime As you may know the Internet has some obvious limitations that cannot be circumvented I cannot diagnose you blindly over the Internet so I would strongly suggest that you inform your parents immediately of your findings and concerns You need to see a medical provider for a proper examination Herpes is an STD of course It is characterized by painful blisters and those blisters can be on the head of the penis Although I have no way of diagnosing him over the Internet there is good chance that this is indeed herpes He should be medically examined to be sure I dont know Your description is just too vague to make a blind diagnosis You will need to see a medical professional  someone who can gather a more detailed medical history about your STD risk order diagnostic tests and of course examine you firsthand You may have a medical condition called BALANITIS  Please see your medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated I am not a big fan of recommending or endorsing products that have not been scientifically tested or proven to be efficacious Since this is not considered a drug it bypasses the scrutiny of doubleblind drug testing and FDA approval The ingredients are natural but that does not make it safe or effective so I would raise a skeptical eyebrow when using these things You are really taking a chance Since I do not know your medical history other medications that you might be using I have no idea if this would be safe for you I suggest that you run this by your medical provider first The penis reaches its maximum size at age 17 so there is really no chance yours will really increase in size any more Not knowing the accuracy of your measurement or whether this was done when erect or flaccid the average size of an erect penis is around six inches Smaller penises increase in size more when erect than larger penises In spite of what you hear or even see penises when erect do not vary more than an inch or two across the wide range of humans of different races or genetics It is not the size of your penis that matters You do not judge an artist by the size of his paint brush The size of penis is not the measure of man but rather who you are as a caring and compassionate person Partner likes it but you are concerned Read about Peyronies disease Obviously you cannot be diagnosed blindly over the Internet but this would be a consideration At age 13 this is a bit unusual He may have a condition called phimosis This may need to be treated with topical steroids for a minor amount of foreskin adhesions or a minor surgical procedure so take him to see a urologist Cut it short No you are fine You are not going to become pregnant from this act Be careful and remember to ALWAYS use condoms No your medications that you listed are not the cause You do need to see your medical provider about this issue however so you can have an examination and a few diagnostic tests The is a very unusual sexrelated injury Are you sure you didnt mistake your partner for a cactus The damage should heal spontaneously in a few days assuming you dont injury it again but a little topical antibiotic ointment would be helpful If you do not improve it would be advisable to see your medical provider for an examination Expect to see some raised eyebrows regading the mechanism of injury It would not be appropriate for you to post a picture of your genitals or that mysterious black thing you have noticed Since you are concerned it would be important for you to have your penis examined firsthand by a medical professional A description just doesnt do it The penis reaches its maximum size at age 17 so you are there Testosterone cream will no increase your penis size and it is not a good idea to use it The average size of an adult penis is 63 inches erect I suspect you are average or close I have no way to determine if you have permanent damage since I cant examine you but my guess would be that your body will heal When There is really no way to guess when this might happen I would suggest that you see a urologist if this problem does not selfcorrect in a few more weeks of rest not endurance cycling It is okay to use it I am guessing that you have balanitis  perhaps balanitis due to a yeast monilial infection This is notorious for causing an itchy red penisThis is just a blind guess since I do not have any way of examining you over the Internet If this is indeed a monilial infection topical antifungal creams would be the treatment of choice Many good ones are available overthecounter Ask your pharmacist It depends on the percentage and amount of xylocaine and the reason it is being used No a normal CBC will not tell you if you have active syphilis or not but there are many sensitive tests that your doctor can order to answer that trouble syphilis fear Unfortunately I do not have enough medical history about you or have the ability to delve into your clinical case to discuss the significance of a normal or abnormal CBC as it relates to you You will need to address this with your medical provider  someone who has the ability to correlate any lab findings with your history and physical examination results Why dont you give your swollen penis a day off Save the Viagra to use when your penis is no longer swollen Yes of course Vaginal dryness can be uncomfortable for both partners so it would be wise to use a sexual lubricant next time Any discharge from the penis should be considered suspicious and be properly evaluated If this cloudy discharge only occurs during a bowel movement or straining constipation then one possible cause could be prostatitis  a prostate gland infection or problem You need to see your primary care medical provider or a urologist to be properly diagnosed and treated Talk to your surgeon but it is not unusual to have some leakage of blood under the skin or subcutaneous tissue south of the surgical incision that could involve the penis or scrotal area Blame it on gravity This would look like a deep bruise It may be red af first but then turns a bluishpurple as the body reabsorbs the blood I cant tell you why since I have no way of examining you and I do not know your age or body weight body weight can be contributory do to a fat pad located around the penis Since you are worried and scared I would suggest that you get an appointment with a good urologist for a highlevel evaluation of this new event This may be a sign of infection perhaps an STD I would suggest that you see a medical professional so that you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated In my opinion that is NOT okay Having taught this exam for over four decades to medical students this is NOT the way this exam should be doneever The doctors technique is highly unusual inappropriate and has strong sexual implications UTIs are very rare in men assuming you are male If you are having unprotected sex and diagnosed with NGU really this is Chlamydia all the letters NGU really mean is that you do not have gonorrhea Hopefully the STD clinic ran the appropriate lab tests Urethritis is really an infection or inflammation of the urethraperiod Urethritis can have many causes but Chlamydia is high on that list I cant really diagnose you blindly over the Internet but your penile rash has nothing to do with urethritis I dont know what ointment you are using but if it is getting better than good You still could have an infection Prostatitis can cause a milky discharge but so can Chlamydia There are many causes that must be considered from a urinary tract infection rare in men to balanitis the red bloches See a medical provider so that you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated  things that cannot be accomplished over the Internet Penis enlargement pills are worthless Pure quackery You can not medically increase the size of your penisyour handsyour feetyour noseanything using a supplement As an adult what you have is what you got my friend Remember that it isnt the size it is how you use it Your most sensitive sexual organ in a loving and caring relationship is between your ears your brain The best way to enlarge your penis size is to use exercisesAnother tip on increasing your size is to use pills There are only a few Male Sexual Enhancement Pills that will work The rest of them wont help you increase your size Theyre only good for giving you erections Which isnt the same as enlarging your penis size So be sure you read the directions The change of skin on any part of the body should be noted When itching comes and goes and color change should be looked at by a physician as there are a number of conditions that could be occuring Maybe a change in laundry detergents or body wash but any and all changes in skin color and itching needs to be addressed by a physician Of course wearing protection for yourself  others is advised A couple of thoughts Be sure you see a urologist as many doctors in my experience have told men that they cannot take any of the erectile dysfunction meds when in fact they often can and quite safely If the pump is all you can use that is fine too as it has been a good solid ED treatment for many years with high patient and partner satisfaction A couple of downsides  the rings can only be left on for no more than 30 minutes No more or damage can happen One patient complained that the penis did feel cool to the touch after a while One man complained his penis felt like it was on a hinge All in all it works it is safe there are no chemicals in your system and it is easy to use once you get it figured out which can take a number of tries Penile pumps and theres mechanical devices that you can use those are all good for erection And they work great Before the days of Viagra that was a common operation if a guy had diabetes or a prior pelvic surgery and he couldnt get an erection and injections didnt work we had amazing results with penile implants whether inflatable or mechanical And almost all the men who had those implants were thrilled with them In the old days you had about one out of a hundred would break and youd have to go back and fix it Either the pump would go bad or a line would erode or something would go wrong or leak The newer advances in products are so much better They not only increase they not only fill length but fill girth and they are far more reliable with rare risks of complications But with the advent of these new medications out now most men dont need that Theres still a need for it and theres still experts around the world that specialize in that and get great results But that doesnt change the length or the width of the penis It just simply restores the ability for rigidity There are techniques for penile enlargement surgery what that involves you really dont enlarge the penis but what you really do is change perception There is a ligament that holds the penis up and when you cut it drops down and it can actually increase in length a quarter of an inch or half an inch not enough to even be significant But theres risks with that Then theres techniques where they can inject fat along the penis to try to make it look bigger But even if you look at interviews with hundreds of men who have these penile enlargement procedures almost all of them are disasters theyre unhappy they dont like how it turned out and time and again the interviews almost always ended with the man saying I wish I never did this avoid it at all costs its not what you think Complications are horrible imagine if you get an infection down there  the scarring the misery chronic pain curvature that cant be corrected Most men that opt for penile enlargement surgery using current technologies are very very unhappy Its really not a wise thing to do Very commonly men can develop problems in and around the foreskin and the penis called balinitis and thats just from chronic irritation It could be from a yeast infection It could be that it got dry it could be a hygiene issue The first thing you want to do is keep it clean and dry and try antifungal creams over the counter If it continues to be a problem then you probably should see a urologist who can assess and determine if theres something more serious it could always be penile cancer thats more rare but you want to make sure that theres nothing going on there then if it turns out that there is a problem chronic infections then you want to look at the options One of them is formal circumcision which is the last option Another one is called a dorsal slit where instead of removing the foreskin they simply cut through the scar that develops so that you can retract it easily and maintain your hygiene Sometimes its simply changing the medications or aggressive medication Sometimes lesions on the penis can be actually drug reactions that manifest themselves or allergic reactions So you should never assume that its just one thing you know if youve got a recurrent infection and jump right to a circumcision You want to know why youre getting the infection Maybe its the first warning sign of being diabetic These are all things that can play into it Thats again where a doctor can see the big picture and look at more than just whats obvious to try to figure out whats going on And then help you decide whats best for you because obviously you have to decide what you want for yourself the doctor is really there to help you and service and ideally provide you the pros and cons of the options so you can choose intelligently and decide whats best No You are born a certain way based on your genetics If you dont like your genitals then choose different parents If youre fat down there then you can lose weight and improve the length of your penis But there is nothing you can do taking herbs will not improve your penile length weights on the end of your bed while you sleep will not improve it the vacuum devices that they sell will not do it You are born with what youre born with and rather than stress and fret about problems or perceived inadequacies you really should be focusing on ways of finessing what youve got to make yourself and your partners happy What you can do is be healthy take care of yourself learn other techniques to enhance the relationship its not just all about penile length theres other things that you can do during lovemaking that will enhance pleasure for the female partner if thats what its all about If its just simply wanting to feel proud in the shower in front of other guys then you just have to understand that thats who you are thats how you were born and rather than spending your energy and time focusing on what you dont have focus on what you do have Thats a controversy I have many patients including physicians as adults whove been circumcised and initially after the circumcision theyre hypersensitive they can feel more than they like its almost more uncomfortable than they can take and then it levels off Some men will tell you that they dont feel any more or less after the circumcision Some men feel very maimed that the sensation is dramatically lost if the foreskin is a sensory organ and they lose that there are other men that dont like having a foreskin that they find it to be a problem for them whether they find a lot of infection or maybe its social maybe in the gym all the other guys in the shower are circumcised and they feel out of place There are risks to the surgery In good hands those risks are minimal but they cant be eliminated So the circumcision in newborns or adults needs to be looked at by you by your partner in discussions with your doctor as to what you feel is best for you as a family understanding that there are pros and cons to both sides You have had a penile fracture and there is a significant chance you will develop scarring and curvature at that point For men with fresh penile fracture we tell them no sex of any kind for 2 to 3 weeks at a minimum You should see a urologist soon For severe fractures with severe pain swelling and extensive bruising we often fix those surgically if we see the man right after it happens If there is a delay or it is not severe we often manage conservatively I would expect some inflammation and swelling but this sounds more than I have seen I would give it some time as he suggests wear an athletic supporter 247 for a few weeks outside underwear to keep it snug  gravity is not your friend here Also ask your urologist about taking antiinflammation meds such as Celebrex or overthecounter but highdose ibuprofen or Aleve Maybe even ice up twice a day Stay in close contact with him Sounds like Peyronies plaque You need to see a urologist and ask about treatments to include Vitamin E therapy and injections of medications into the plaque It can get worse and lead to ED and severe curvature It seems to point downwards when the erection happens NOHARD well it i used to Masturbate every night for about 23 weeks then shortly after i was doing it in the morning too It went awayIm almost positive it was from the way I was taking care of the scratch httpyoutubedsjtAvCpDO4 Nohardno actually m experiencing the feeling when m masterburating but very less amount of sperm can be found on the tip of the penis holeby the way i can pee freely and my urine is clearsometimes when m drinking less amount of water in a day my urine is getting yellowish No I have not had unprotected sex ever you have two different issues going on whiting of pubic hairs and white skin patches at 35 we do get gray I dont think this may be the case  if you have pigment troubles you have to see a doctor and you might have a sexually transmitted problem I would advise you to see a doctor for men that deal with skin treatmentsI cannot see your Penis and I am not a Doctor I would be concerned if you could have a disorder in your system that changes pigment its always good to see a skin cancer specialist because they are very knowledgeable with skin all kinds of skin issues and problems first clean out your tub rince of any strong cleaner from your tub fill it with warm water and backing soda soak for 20 mins make you have an over the counter yeast cream the best would be medication for athletes foot it docent mater if its store brand the other thing you can do is go in the isle with contraceptives buy a itch medication also they have wipes to carry around with you  Monastat can burn you if you are to raw you might have to look into differenttypes of condoms not made of latex and make sure your skin can tolerate the types a spermicide read labels good luck to you Wet dreams are very normal at puberty Dont feel worried about since it is a normal process of your sexual development Go to see an urologist The yellow cum could be related to peeing before masturbation but if you have problems peeing you can have an infection Probably you did it hardly Use a baby cream like Balmex for the irritation No Vacuum pumps exercise weights and devices and patches pills and supplements dont work More than 10000 men in the US  probably many more  have gone on the operating table to get highly controversial penis enlargement surgery which on average adds less than an inch in length Odds are that your penis is a normal size The average erect penis is four to six inches long with a circumference of four to six inches Theres more variation in the size of flaccid penises If you insist that youre small  even when the ruler says youre not  you may have penile dysmorphic disorder Its similar to the perceptual distortion of anorexics who still think theyre fat no matter how thin they get According to one study the majority of men who get penis enlargement surgery have this condition They are also the least satisfied with the results As for penis enlargement surgeries  to lengthen or widen the penis  the American Urological Association stresses that they have not been proven safe or effective  Only if you dont wash right after the deed I am sexually active but married for 14 years so std are negative HIV If you havent had any erectile dysfunction in the past and dont have any underlying blood conditions or health problems Id say this is likely due to wear and tear from vigorous sexual activity and should heal in a few days Abstain from sexual intercourse including masturbation and if its really painful treat it like an injurypossibly ice it if you note any swelling Should your symptoms persist or alter contact your physician If the situation becomes painful seek emergency care I have also had this problem and i am allergic to latex I would strongly suggest using non latex condoms from now on If it still continues to hurt to the point you dont want to urinate i would go to a gynecologist Or the health department if you dont want your parents to find out Sounds like a bacterial infection Get an antibiotical ointment or cream for the penis Give it five day to a week to heal Also dont wash the penis with soap I know that you wish to teach him cleanliness but there is a possibility that soap could be caught between the penis and the foreskin causing bacteria to build up Warm water on a cloth is good penis health Keep a relationship with your pediatric doctor just in case the ointment or cream does not help Thanks for your reply You need to go to your primary care physician while you still have bumps The white you see on the top of the bump is the infection Your doctor will be able to take a culture and test it for an STD Once the bumps pop they become a lesion and scab over there is nothing to test By you popping the bumps you may be likely to spread the infection to different parts of your body andor your partner Ie mouth nose thighs anal etal Actually Masters  Johnson say the average erect penis is 56 So who knows you might even be well hung The next morning i noticed that my foreskin was very swollen over my penis head uncircumcised and that it was quite itchy I started researching what it could be I think i cause might be that because i couldnt clean my penis properly cuz of my cut and because of masturbating last night i developed and infection I went to walgreens and bought Lotrimin Ultra and rubbed it around the swollen areas Also there when i would pull the swollen foreskin back there was always a clear ish liquid on it maybe water idk Please help me im very worried and i need to know if what i am doing is right and what i should be doing Well I have tried the doctor multiple times My area has no dermatologist so I have to travel over a he to find one I have the doctor office sending a list of dermatologists I could see Until then Im trying to get some info here I have tried multiple creams and its still persistent nervous of an std I guess and just flat out frightened So yes I am trying to see a dermatologist but is little difficult with my career at this point No vacation yet Theres no other way to contact genital warts but through sexual intercourse so someones either lying to you or the doctors wrong you said above your penis do you mean on the head around where your pee comes out or on your actual stomach sort of between your stomach and penis where your hair line is  No There is no single test for all sexually transmitted infections  separate tests are needed Genital warts pubic lice and scabies may be detected during a physical exam Blood may be drawn to test for hepatitis herpes HIV or syphilis Urine samples can be used to test for gonorrhea chlamydia or HIV Samples of discharge can be used to test for herpes gonorrhea chlamydia trichomonas or syphilis Tissue can be tested for chlamydia gonorrhea or scabies Saliva can be used to test for HIV antibodies Health care providers dont automatically test for sexually transmitted infections  you should ask to be tested Be honest with your provider about your sexual history and what risks youve taken and the two of you can decide which tests are appropriate Hi Sound Good STD Sexually Transmitted Diseases are infections that are passed from person to person through sexual contact including Vaginal sex  the mans penis in the womans vagina Anal sex  the mans penis in the partners anus the partner can be either male or female Oral sex  the mans penis in the partners mouth or the partners mouth or tongue in the womans vagina Oralanal sex  one partners mouth or tongue on the other partners anus Sexually transmitted diseases are caused by different infectious microorganisms including bacteria viruses and parasites which are transmitted through semen vaginal fluid blood or other body fluids during sexual activity Procedures range from manual exercises to stretching devices and surgical procedures with reports of successes and failures around the world While some techniques are known to be outright hoaxes others can produce some measure of success Often in the advertising of fraudulent products the distinction between temporary enlargement ie erection and  is deliberately muddied You might want to try a lubricant and make sure you are wearing a condom I know more about the connection between HPV and cervical cancer in women but there seems to potentially be a link between HPV and genital cancers in men Also I know that men and women can transfer HPV to each other through sexual contact Heres more information on HPV in men Hope this helps httpwwwwebmdcomsexualconditionshpvgenitalwartshpvvirusmen Sure does  there are actually 4 types of prostatitis I read your question and while I dont know what to tell you to do exactly I can tell you that a medical professional will not be shocked by anything you have done They have to keep things confidential so dont worry about that part of it either Plus its their job  they are there for things like this Before you start self medicating I would see a doctor and not wait I know there are a lot of topical medications that shouldnt be put in sensitive areas so I would really be hesitant to treat without a doctors care Also the faster you go the faster you will feel better and your anxiety over it will be lifted No It might facilitate intercourse if you have her stand around the corner Of course youre safe Who ever heard of getting an STD AT A MASSAGE PARLOR I know Im not a doctor but I know if you lose 30 pounds you gain like an Inch Good Luck genital warts are similar to cold sores once the virus is in your system there is no removing it the virus can lay dormant for many years before reoccurring if you notice that you are experiencing symptoms again i would visit your doctor There really is no sure way of knowing without inspecting the blisters However because of the reddening of the skin it leads me to believe you have an allergy Keep in mind an allergy can appear at any time You could eat peanuts all your life then one day have a reaction She could also have a yeast infection which has been passed on to you Its rare for a male to get blisters from a transferred yeast infection but it can happen Yeast infections can be transferred during intercourse but it isnt a true sexually transmitted disease Women can get yeast infections from antibiotics or wearing panties that dont breathe And lastly the reason I want you to go to the Dr for inspection of the blistersHerpes Dont fly off the handle I think this is the least likely Also keep in mind that herpes is not just transferred by intercourse If she has a cold sore or fever blister on her mouth she couldve transmitted it to you via oral sex Please dont automatically think your wife is cheating Get an accurate diagnosis from your doctor before you even give it a first thought I am surprised at the fact that you have all these diagnosis And test results But have not been treated for the symptoms It may just be a urinary tract infection I would revisit the Dr who gave you this imformation and results from your test And tell him or her that the problem still persist An allergic reaction to what  Sounds more like some type of infection The sores need to be looked at by a Dr An a urine lab test done normal just keep an eye on it You should apply creams prescribed by the doctor Also take in medications orally according to the type of psoriasis you have Its such a disease that cant be treated online You will have to see a doctor i tried all penis enlargement product  pills not working  only natural penis enlargement exercise working  i tryed it i enlargement 15 inch about in 4

need to get tested for STD need to tell doctor to test when they do test they check different things have to be specific test for STD sorry but sounds like u may have herpes take a hot shower every day with soap better still you both shower together then you can wash his junk and make sure its clean It is called retro grade ejaculationIt can be caused by the arteries getting smaller from smoking diabetes high blood pressure and problems with your prostate It is usually not harmful but you should see a urologist to have a check up The most likely reason is that one of your previous sexual partners has not experienced the HPV infection most women dont and if youre not looking for them regular physicals there can be some that small that your doctor wouldnt see them with hisher eyes only There is a tiny tiny chance that you had a wart on your hands or some other part of the body that you cut and then spread the virus to your genitals the doc told me that he sees this pretty much only when women shave and spread the virus with the razor because both sites have miniscule nics But this is so unlikely that I would say it has to be your partners I meant to say that a lot of women have HPV but have no symptoms It doesnt absorb well on the penile shaft I use Androforte cream which is applied to your scrotum where it absorbs readily since it has intimate contact with many blood vessels to pick it up rapidly there Rod when I was a preteen boy we rather than be caught riding a girls bikeand the crossbar was perfect for giving girl or a friend a ride home from school Its a shame present day kids are growing up in such overprotective little fun but safe times Little wonder the kids are growing up as couch potatoes And dont get me started on the removal of diving boards from swimming pools Poor kids Here is some more info about myself I was in a long term safe sex relationship in college After that I had protected sex with two Asian girls at a spa I dont think the condom broke but Im not 100 percent positive I havent had any kind of sexual intercourse in over one year About 3 or 4 weeks ago I did get a table shower at an Asian spa No intercourse of any kind but she did scrub my erect penis quite hard with a spongy thing during the table shower I also have red spots on the left side of my public region near where my waistband rests They do not really seem to be raised and they are not puss filled The spots only seem to annoy me when my waist band rubs them I never noticed and bumps or anything on my penis or scrotum before I have noticed different kinds of bumps and rashes in my pubic area where my waistbelt sits in the past Could this all be related to the possible fungal infection or do I have an std Just because your girlfriend knows about your wife doesnt make the guilt go away If your wife doesnt know I think it has a lot to do with your subconscious guilt My boyfriend was cheating on me and he couldnt get an erection for me So I think it

opening of our penis Also not sure if tests are available now that are less invasive but several years back the only test that existed to check men for clamydia involved swabbing the inside of the mans urethra I am not circumcised and my foreskin sometimes retracts during intercourse and sometime it does not The more enlarged with blood my penis is the less the skin retracts I used to always retract it when first married but then found that the foreskin can act as a way of aiding penetration if penetration is started when while the foreskin is on the head of the penis Most uncircumcised guys I have talked to say that their penis is sensitive enough so that if the foreskin rolls back and exposes the penile head during intercourse they are very aware of it Most like that a few dont About half of the boys in the town where I grew up were uncut about half cut because there were two doctors delivering babiesone tried to talk all parents into leaving their boys intact the other tried to talk all parents into having their boys uncircumcised In my opinion the majority of uncircumcised males can tell if their foreskin is retracted during intercourse based on my conversations with other uncircumcised males As far as penetration you can get a good idea of how much penetration there is by measuring on top the length of your penis then during intercourse put a hand down there during fullest penetration you can manage and see WHERE on your penis a finger hits How much penis is still outside the vagina Then you will have a pretty good answer as to how much penetration there is Your not running a risk with AIDS from bjs but I would recommend getting to know the guys history a little because herpes are for life There are edible condoms if you are skeptical of these issues

hair it usually the first thing that happens as an adolesent the rest will follow Give it some time and try not to worry too much Personally I would get a second opinion Im sure that he was right that your prostate was ok but he didnt elaborate into any of the other symptoms or give you any sort of possible explaination If you feel that he often pushes you out of the office it may be best to find a different doctor Feel free to ask when you make an appt how long the doctor allows for each patient then pick one who takes a longer time with their patients Until you see a doctor again make sure you are getting enough fiber in your diet Fruits vegetables and whole grains will make having a bowel movement much easier Good Luck  A person gets HIV when an infected persons body fluids blood semen fluids from the vagina or breast milk enter his or her bloodstream The virus can enter the blood through linings in the mouth anus or sex organs the penis and vagina or through broken skinIn other words ALWAYS use a condom There are a lot of things that can cause the penis to appear dry and flaky Yeast infections skin allergies drying soaps or even dry masturbation or sex can cause this If there is any reason to think you could have an STD then it is really important that you get tested But you can work on dry skin problems by adding a moisturizing penis health crme health professionals

medical maybe that is some inner thought that society has placed that anul massage during sex is forbidden an if so jusst speak with ur partner about this issue to talk make fix it Dont worry about it The average penis in america is 6 inches I to am not well endowed but my Wife LOVE mine She says it is just right and doesnt hurt her You are probably going by the magazines and movies Trust me they ARE NOT normal sized We are created individually and when you find Mrs right she wont care if you are sexually aroused theres a valve that shuts off urine flow and makes it impossible to urinate during sex if you are not aroused then you need to see a urologist about your possible enlarged prostate mine has been enlarged since my twenties when you first have the urge to urinate dont wait the longer you hold it the more it hurts blood pressure meds help as does flomax Sounds like an in grown hair You are more likely to get ingrown hairs if you shave in this area If it doesnt go away on its on in a short time or if more appear I would get to you doctor just to be sure yes it could be fungal Depending of what direction you have more confidence in get candida treatment like fluconazole and if you are circumsized use the creams like Canesten If you are not circumsized I would not recommend the creams as they shrink the foreskin and you will feel like a little boy again  but then the foreskin cracks and that really is painfull and impossible to keep clean If you go for the more natural approach gentle soaking and washing with a mild sollution of nice quality applecider vinegar will work like a miracle cure  I would say normally it should be in between 3 to 8 inchs I hope that I am wrong but I had the same type of thing however mine had other symptoms such as a reoccurring UTI once or twice a year for for over 10 years Mine was attributed to a calcium build up on the walls of the urethra and other veins in the area due to a bladder diverticulum I was a Milk Junkie 12 gallon a day I had over 3000 calcium stones in a sack about 34 the size of my bladder I understand there are many reasons Why you may not want to see a Doctor that is your choice I am gay and have anal sex I got an anal wart on the shaft of my penis once by not using a condom I used Compound W to remove it Mind you this will burn and hurt and it will take a few applications but it should remove your Tag Try to keep the Compound W only on the tag and not cover a large area Again and fair warning this is going to burn and hurt See a Md about this the symptoms are realted to herpies simplex avoid intercoure untill checked Urinary tract infection I had this happen to me in 1995 when I was prescribed the psychiatric medication Risperdal for my mental illness schizophrenia A lab test revealed that my prolactin level was high which in women increases after giving birth to a baby causing increased breast milk production and inhibited ovulation In men it suppresses semen production In some primitive cultures raising a womans prolactin level is used as a kind of birth control by intentionally suckling a womans breast although it is not as reliable as current pharmacologicalhormonebased methods what can I do about it No there is no gout involved Something moved in the sac and now the penis does not fill up The med was prescribed after this happend Looking for another option than surgery To the person who answered this an hour ago I clearly stated that bacteria tests were NEGATIVE if youre not gonna bother reading it then dont bother answering it Sperm can swim Male sperm are fast and furious while Female sperm are slower but live longer and stick around longer If your cervical mucus is thin and stretchy and if you arent using excessive lubricants I am positive that not penetrating deeply is no problem at all In fact some experts associate less deep ejaculations with female children as the male sperm die before reaching their destination As awkward as it is go to a doctor My friend had a similar issue and ended up with an infection because of bruising within the foreskin He has since gotten a circumcision but it wasnt necessary He simply didnt want to have that ever happen again Also wanted to post a link to a photo WARNING  its the base of a penis  httpimgurcomNtF5fGq Do you love your partner  If not that might be why only if you want to I found a tick on my penis back in the summer How it got there I have no clue Anyway I removed it and a small bump remained I suspect it was the ticks head still imbedded in my skin and the bump was my body slowly absorbing it Yes its disgusting and frightening to think of a parasite attaching itself to my genitals but ultimately the bump went away in about a week or so with no lasting effects No Lyme disease Youre probably OK but you could always go to the doctor for advice just so he or she can inform you about what symptoms of Lyme disease to look for A urologist would be the one to see Its not normal and if its causing you pain you need to make it clear to the urologist that you dont want to live with it By the way are you sure youre giving it time enough to fully heal before engaging in masturbation or sexual activity which tears it open again I remember when I was a teenager I ripped the frenulum from too vigorous masturbation and it stayed torn and painful for weeks because I couldnt stop touching myself It finally did heal but it forced me to change how I masturbated light touch rather than jerking off so as to not irritate it further I have heard that this could be a sign of dangerously high blood pressure Bleeding from the penis is not normal at all Id go to the doctor if I were you If you masturbate frequently you may have accustomed yourself to the friction of your own hand Try varying your masturbation technique use lube to simulate a wet mouth use a lighter touch etc I would also add that if you are basing what you think your sexual response ought to be on images from pornography you may have the idea that all men can come from oral sex Keep in mind that even in pornography most of the men masturbate themselves to finish rather than finishing in their partners mouth Yes you can use moisturizer on your penis Some men even use lotion when masturbating as a lubricant If you do have a cut on your penis using lotion might burn a little though Perhaps normal but you need to stop the behavior and have a talk with the boys about boundaries Say something like Its OK to touch and play with yourself in private It feels good and all people do it But you should not touch your brothers penis and he should not touch yours They likely dont understand what they are doing as sexual in the adult sense although the licking is a little odd for such young kids Thats more of a learned sexual behavior rather than more instinctual sexual exploration Have either of them been exposed to oral sex perhaps inadvertently in porn or perhaps seeing their parents Id be more concerned about that than the sexual exploration in general You might want to ask in a nonjudgmental way where the boys learned about licking Thanks for all the support I didnt pop it agian it was painful I did look online in other resources and someone recommended Calimine lotion  after about 12 hours it was smaller in size and i touched it and it poped itself with very little pain Lots of puss but the swelling is going down Im washing it periodically now with Saline water Thanks everyone I will keep everyone posted if i have anymore questions ill post another thanks for all the help agian That is the average size "}
