{"text": "When my ACL was torn it did not bother my foot unless i put pressure on it most of the pain was in my knee I would practice breathing techniques to help me relax on a daily bases  I have had no previous injuries httpwwwonhealthcomkneepainpage2htmwhatinjuriescancausekneepainandwhataresymptomshowiskneepainwithinjurydiagnosedandtreated A boatload of reasons could be responsible for balance problem Among the reasons are some of the following  infections  low blood sugar  low blood pressure  vision disturbances  medications  T IAs or mini strokes  irregular heartbeats  tumors of the brain  middle ear infections  muscular or joint injuries  even nutritional deficiencies and many other reasons It seems like you have eliminated the ear one of the most notorious reasons for balance disturbance issues If you do not feel that your knee is slipping out from under you and you dont recall any trauma to the area and being a year post knee surgery that would also seem to eliminate the knee I would startout with your family doctor who may complete an interview of your health and symptoms complete a physical examination and order some blood work These measures should eliminate some of the many possible causes of your distress The final steps to reaching a diagnosis may require other testing and possibly being referred to medical specialist such as a neurologist cardiologist or eye doctor Sideeffects do occur with Naproxen and are categorized as common less common  rareAccoring to Drugscom  I would notify the prescriber to determine if a sideeffect is in playing a role in your knee pain My wife has been diagnosed with Congestive Heart Failure COPD Cardiomyopathy and Cardio Arrhythmia more than 15 years ago She also has lung disease in the form of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease COPD and Asthma She has had a painful recovery from a full knee replacement surgery 8 months ago and periodically takes Tylenol to reduce inflammation and control pain Her cardiologist supports Tylenol as her OTC drug of choice It is always a smart decision to discuss all overthecounter medications with your physician before starting an OTC medication regimen Many of these OTC treatments contain ingredients that may interact with other medications andor be contraindicated for cardiac patients It is unlikely that your knee surgery has any relationship with your stiff neck Stiff necks are most frequently a result of trauma in the form of moving suddenly in a jerky fashion The stiff neck may also be caused by haphazard sleeping positions or maintaining a general poor posture Treatment of a stiff neck may start with warm compresses massage of the affected area with over the counter muscle creams and liquids and the taking of analgesic medications If your neck remains stiff and painful after 72 hours following the recommended treatment a visit to your family doctor or the chiropractor is justified From the tone of your question it appears that you suffer from intense back pain Severe back pain can control your life and needs to be medically assessed I suspect that youll be disappointed with OTC medications to treat your back pain as they probably wont touch your pain With that said you may consider taking Ibuprofen Ibuprofen is available OTC in a strength of 200 mg Prescription strengths of Ibuprofen are available in 400 mg 600 mg and 800 mg Therefore you could buy OTC Ibuprofen and take up to 4 pills to provide you with the maximum 800 mg strength This practice should only be considered to gain some short term relief 23 weeks max It should also be noted that like most medications Ibuprofen can have serious side effects and even cause stomach ulcers It should be taken with a meal or milk and the daily dosage should not exceed 3200 mg My suggestion is to see a pain management specialist who can prescribe something stronger and assess possible back damage and provide other treatment options Physical therapy and biofeedback may also help or you may need a prescribed narcotic to obtain pain resolution I used a weight calculator program to arrive at the below listed daily numbers To maintain your current weight Calories

Protein 15 340 Fat 30 680  Please Note  Knee and hip replacements consisting of metalonmetal may cause a condition called Metallosis  This side effect happens when rubbing of the metal implanted surfaces results in chromium and cobalt particles accumulating in the blood stream to toxic levels some cobalt  chromium is normally found in the blood stream to carryout routine cellular actions The recommended treatment for Metallosis is a complete surgical revision removing the implant and installing a new implant of the knee or hip  Many factors must be considered before starting your exercise program your overall health including cardiac and lung functioning to name a couple Your knee replacement is also a relevant factor in determining exercise suitability For example my wife is being treated for congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease She is also looking to lose some weight and had a full knee replacement done in June 2013 Her orthopedic surgeon recently ordered more physical therapy in response to knee pain and some range of motion limitations After you are cleared medically perhaps a licensed physical therapist could customize an exercise program that would address your knee replacement specifically The up side of this plan is that your knee will be strengthened and your body as a whole will benefit Additionally the physical therapist will act as a cheerleader to support your exercise goals Any exercise directed at the knee should be a justifiable as a billable treatment in the eyes of most insurance companies My wife is riding a stationary bicycle doing knee squats has weights wrapped around her knee area while elevating the leg and walking using the parallel bar platform These exercise techniques can also be employed at home with the number of repetitions and endurance being gradually increased Swimming is also a great exercise that should not have negative consequences in response to your knee replacement These are my recommendations  1 Discuss your weight loss desire with your family doctor Perhaps he or she will recommend a great diet to kick start your weight loss program and clear you medically for an exercise program2 phone your orthopedist and ask for a physical therapy referral to strengthen your knee3 call your medical insurance provider to find an approved physical therapy company in your living area The process of losing weight after knee replacement is an obtainable goal through diet and exercise Your success will probably be measured in small incremental steps Remember as a Chinese Proverb states A long journey starts with the first step Best wishes for your success Congratulations on arriving at 83 years of age  contemplating a combined hip and knee replacement Based upon the infrequency of the joint knee and hip operations being combined I would think that the number of responses to your question will be limited Although my age and medical history are somewhat dissimilar I can share from my experiences of having a full knee replacement 10 months ago and a revision of that knee surgery earlier this week Let me tell you about my medical profile I am younger than you but have had congestive heart failure cardiomyopathy cardioarrhythmia asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease for at least 15 years During both of my knee surgeries and a gallbladder removal operation during 2013I had no insurgery room complications or anesthesia problems In order to be approved for my knee surgeries by the surgeon and hospital anesthesia department I had not pass medical clearance testing consisting of an echo cardiogram cardiac stress test and an ultra sound of blood vessels in my neck Additionally I was required to have formal hard copy surgical clearances in written form from my family doctor and cardiologist Depending on the parties involved a pulmonologist may also be required to provide surgical clearance I had to have inrange serum blood studies completed within 30 days of surgery I was also required to have presurgery testing at the hospital during the week preceding the knee surgery During my first knee surgery I was also required to donate 1 unit of blood 2xs within 2 weeks of my surgery I also was required by my surgeon to attend a 2 hour orientation to learn about the knee replacement procedure the possible need for skilled nursing rehabilitation required physical therapy and the long term prognosis for success My first knee surgery failed my patella joint slipped from sideto side and caused me great pain With my knee revision surgery the surgeon pretty much used some bone chips bone dust and glue to rebuild me a new knee I owe him a lot and feel like Ive been reborn Everything that I have read shows that advanced aged individuals fair just as well as younger patients in both their survival rates rehabilitation process and overall satisfaction Having both the hip and knee replaced at the same time means that youll probably spend twice as long in surgery need more inpatient hospital time and more rehabilitation time But because my 2nd knee surgery was a revision I was also subjected to those same additional times I did notice during my presurgery classes that a number of patients were scheduled to have both knees replaced at the same time It did not seem like an out of the ordinary occurrence and will also require more time to complete I have had neighbors and friends in their 80s who had knee surgery and were highly satisfied My personal feeling is that you should become emotionally prepared and be aware that there are no guarantees of success But trust me if you are able to pass all of the required presurgical testing youll come out of surgery in good condition The hospitals and doctors will not take a chance on performing these surgeries on a risky candidate Your biggest concern post surgery should be what cruise and fun activities should I explore first My anecdotal accountings from other people who had both surgeries  not at the same time  have been favorable Physical limitations depression and fatigue without the surgeries are common With the surgery you stand a very good chance of eliminating those conditions and replacing them with feelings of joy Best wishes on your decision and may you enjoy many days of rich happiness Congratulations on arriving at 83 years of age

happiness Im sorry that you did not receive an appropriate response to your original question Here is some information that you may find helpful It is a safe bet that the knee damage did not occur during the actual surgical procedurePatellar fractures occur most frequently after a blow to the knee occurs such as a fall While complications from total hip replacement do not typically include knee breakage I believe that it is possible Many internet forum discussion responders claim that they experienced intense knee pain after their THR Surgery  I did not see any reports of knee breakage Some posters reported thigh problems after THR surgery It should be noted that blood may collect in the lower extremities like the knee and ankle after THR and results in pain Atrophy of the quadriceps muscle can also happen if exercise programs aimed at strengthening are not started in a timely manner Femur fractures are a possible complication with THR as the thigh muscles can contract so violently that it pulls the patella apart My conclusion The hip femur and knee all work together So it reasonable to conclude that some THR complication caused the knee damage Additionally your wife would surely know if she experienced a violent traumatic event to her knee But since most knee breakage is a result of trauma such as experienced in a fall it will be difficult to attribute the knee damage to the THR Surgery I hope that your wife will feel well soon Perhaps the computer was acting up while you typed your questionHere is my understanding of your question If I misunderstood any details please resubmit another question in a clear manner I will attempt to paraphrase some of the points that you made and make respectful recommendations as follows It sounds like you may have had one knee either repaired  replaced through a particular physician You were either scheduled for or had your second knee repaired  replaced by another surgeon Now this 2nd doctor will not see you Most doctors are selfemployed and licensed in a certain state to provide medical services This is their business and they can determine the extent of treatment and the type of patients that that they will see in their practice Some doctors will only see babies and not cardiac patients Some may not accept Medicare reimbursement They are allowed to run their business in this manner It is probably best to seek out another doctor to resolve your knee condition Talk to friends and neighbors who may refer you to a suitable doctor Do not talk poorly about your past doctor with a new doctor They may feel like they could be next on your list of disliked doctors Never discuss possible medical malpractice with your doctor Medical malpractice is a serious allegation and must be supported with real evidence It should only be part of a discussion with an attorney if permanent harm has occurred Otherwise you may be cited for making slanderous statements that have adversely affected the doctors business and medical reputation My husband and I have had trouble with leg cramps especially at night and we have found that taking a teaspoon of regular yellow mustard stops the cramping immediately and it does not return My husband has actually started taking the mustard before going to bed to avoid being awakened by the cramping He says this helps him There is a chance that the ganglion may have returned It might be a good idea to have your knee evaluated again Sometimes a Bakers Cyst can become large and track down the calf and cause pain An MRI would show this if that was the case There are not any supplement that have been shown to reliably treat tendonitis There are braces NSAIDS topical antiinflammatories physical therapy and PRP platelet rich plasma injections that have been shown to work Even though I could walk even after falling What are the possible injuries I had total knee surgery twice First the left knee and then the right My doctor gave me the correct excersizes to do thank heavens In comparison to some other people I had spoken with what I did was right I had the physical therapist come to the house for the first time And you  MUST DO THESE EXCERCISES TWICE A DAY WHETHER YOU FEEL LIKE IT OR NOT  30 minutes before you start excercizing you take your pain pill Then lay flat and start leg raises one leg at a time Keep stiff leg and work to get that leg as high up as you can Then do peddling a bicycle with the little 2 foot high bike you can get at a medical store to rent Or maybe you can do that laying down and peddle like a bike with both legs Try it Dont baby yourself I was given a long strip of plastic like a strip of inertube and you put that under the ball of your foot of the affected knee sit straight up and pull it tight with both hands and press down like you are stepping on a gas pedal in the carKeep your leg straight and the rubber tight Eventually you will have to lift some sort of weight with your legSit in a chair and tie something to your ankle like a can of something heavy in something you can put around the ankle to hold it as the weightRrAISE SLOWLY RELEASE SLOWLY RAISE SLOWLY RELEASE SLOWLY These are some of the excersizes I did But when you are done doing all of these put an ice bag on the knee for about 20 minutes Rest YOU MUST UNDERSTAND IF YOU DO NOT DO THE EXERCIZES YOUR DOCTOR GAVE YOUYOU WILL END UP LIKE YOU ARE By this time you should be well on the way to no pain and swelling The ice bag after therapy is probably the answer for you But going to therapy out of the house will stop you from taking you pain pill before you start I would guess Just that little help to ease the pain will make you work harder You might do better doing all your therapy at home using the pain pill and ice packs I hope this might help you You didnt state what you therapy involved  Then you progress from 2 crutches to one crutch on the opposite side of the bad knee From that you go to a cane NO WALKER There are promising new treatments that are being developed using stem cells to stimulate cartiledge growth Your orthopedic surgeon is focused on surgery so he probably wont mention this and may not know about it After having one successful knee replacement arthritis Im biding my time till this treatment becomes available for the other knee As per your query it seems you are having a severe back pain And I can understand that you are feeling very seek and also feel trouble to do your household works So I would love to tell you that you can have Soma 350 mg for back pain relief as it is very fast and effective muscle pain relief medicine And it is easily available to online pharmacies like Meds247online So you may have it as soon as possible to get relief For your any dental problem plz click here  confidentdentalcare  The reason that you might be experiencing soreness in your knees could be due to a variety of different reasons I would first see how your body responds to doing other exercise that may be a little lower impact such as walking swimming kayaking water aerobics using the elliptical rowing stair climbing Yoga or some strength training exercises You can determine if the problem is specific to the type of exercise that youre doing this way You might just be doing too much too soon with jogging Try dialing back your current jogging routine by building in more days of rest in between exercise sessions spending less time per session or jogging at a slower pace You could also try experimenting by adding interval training into your routine where you incorporate intermittent bouts of jogging into your walking routine Lastly try experimenting with different ground surfaces if youre jogging outside the grass or a dirt path might provide less impact than concrete Also it might be worthwhile to invest in good pair of running shoes as well If your painsoreness persists in spite of making some of these changes then I would suggest meeting with a doctorspecialist and discontinuing jogging until you can find out whats causing this This could be casued by a lack of potassium Bananas are a good source Tell more info on this My husband has had 3 replacements 1st was the old way 2nd good and 3rd good The left knee is with the way the do it now They did the right one going down shaft of leg which got loses Cant take it out just did the knee It is ok but his left one is great Wouldnt change that Pad change in 10 yrs Im sorry to hear youre going through this Painful knees are no fun This is something you should have evaluated by a health care provider You can start with your primary care provider While its possible you simply have some arthritis or some inflammation related to doing chores on your knees its also possible you injured your knee Your symptoms could be caused by a variety of knee injuries including a dislocated kneecap Ouch The mere fact that youre having severe inflammation shooting pains and burningstinging sensations indicate you need a physical examination by a health care professional He or she may want to order some tests such as Xray or MRI to help figure out whats going on I wish you all the best in getting bck on your feet literally You should have a preop appointment with your surgeons nurse or physician assistant andor a nurse at the facility where your knee replacement will occur These nurses should answer all your questions about preoperative medication regimens whether or not to take Lantus the day of your surgery when to stop eating before surgery and so on In general people with blood sugar problems can experience longer healing times Id recommend asking your surgeon or hisher nurse or physician assistant what to expect in terms of possible problems healing Because your A1C is good you may not experience any problems at all Be sure to follow all your surgeons printed instructions for postop care of the wound I suggest you write down all your questions for the preop appointment Be sure you receive printed instructions for before and after the surgery If any of your questions arent answered in advance feel free to call your surgeons office for clarification Hope this helps I wish I could explain this but its impossible to know what happened without knowing the specifics involved Percocet generic name oxycodoneAPAP is an oral tablet taken by swallowing Usually postsurgical pain is treated with intravenous IV medication not pills Its possible your postsurgical blood pressure issues had nothing to do with the percocet Normally low blood pressure in the recovery room is treated with IV fluids I dont know what reversal drug you were given for the percocet Im going to assume you received naloxone brand name Narcan I dont know why this would cause you to feel as if you were having a heart attack I could speculate but that would be of no use If you are truly concerned about this I advise taking it up with the surgeon who performed your knee replacement surgery He should have access to the anesthesia and nursing records that show exactly what medications you were given the times they were given and the dosages you received Perhaps your surgeon could shed some light on what happened Wishing you well Im very sorry youre going through this Unbearable pain needs to be addressed because it affects a persons entire life If youve been taking the medication for a couple of weeks or more and still have this excruciating pain then its time to revisit the doctor to let him or her know the medication isnt helping Of the medications you listed only the Lyrica generic name pregabalin is prescribed for pain If it is not helping you should talk with your doctor about what other options are available for treatment I hope you get relief soon Im sorry youre going through this but I doubt it has anything to do with your blood transfusions Just to be clear eczema is not something that can be transmitted through an exchange of blood Eczema is not contagious So you can rule out that theory I suggest you seek a medical opinion about the cause of the scaly itchy skin on your leg It could indeed be eczema But it might be something else altogether A medical professional can not only diagnose the problem but also prescribe an appropriate treatment Wishing you well I think youre wise to get a second opinion Whether or not the Xrays look fine the truth is youre symptomatic You deserve to learn why youre having problems The main reason I wanted to respond though is to suggest you take your temperature If you have a fever Id suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider for some blood work A fever can be a sign of infection and infection of a prosthetic knee is always a possibility If you do have an infection youd want to get that treated as soon as possible While youre waiting for your appointment with the second doctor Id suggest you use an assistive device to help stabilize your balance so you dont fall Either a 4point cane or a walker would be ideal The last thing you want is to sustain an injury before you get your knee problem figured out Wishing you all the best and hoping you feel better soon Well thats hard to say The answer could depend on many factors including your age and whether or not youve had any knee injuries In general its not unusual for our knees to squeak pop creak and crackle when we walk or squat down These sounds can be caused by a variety of things including simple wearandtear to the cartilage within the knee joint or  As long as the squeaking isnt accompanied by pain the sound probably doesnt mean anything If you start to have pain associated with your noisy knees then it would be a good idea to get it checked out You can help keep your knees healthy by following these  As always if youre concerned about whether or not theres something wrong with your knees dont hesitate to make an appointment with your primary care provider Good luck Id suggest you see a doctor about this You can start with your primary care provider and he or she will refer you to an orthopedic doctor if necessary You dont say exactly what kind of surgery you had in 2009 Im thinking it was an arthroscopy to remove pieces of the meniscus If this is the case and youre experiencing new or worsening symptoms youd be well served to see a health care provider I wouldnt necessarily recommend wearing a knee brace You could reduce your range of motion and have a hard time getting it back The only way to truly solve this problem is to get an examination by a health care provider He or she can discuss with you all the various options from physical therapy to surgery that can help solve your knee problem Good luck Im sorry to hear youre going through this It must be frustrating to go through a major surgery and then continue to experience pain issues If your orthopedic surgeon suggested you get a second opinion Id advise you to do just that Its possible a different surgeon with different experience in joint replacement will be able to identify the source of your pain and treat it A number of conditions could cause the pain you describe If you have a fever 101F nausea or feeling like you might be coming down with the flu Id suggest you call your orthopedist as soon as possible as these may be signs of an infection Otherwise Id suggest you get that second opinion I hope you find relief soon You should get medical attention for your brother as soon as possible These symptoms could relate to a variety of ailments and only a health care professional doing a physical examination can give you a diagnosis Any time a persons symptoms get worse or change suddenly its worth a trip to the doctors office In your brothers case this is especially true because his symptoms are causing him to be unable to walk I dont want to alarm you but I urge you to seek medical attention for your brother as soon as possible Best wishes to you both What youre describing cottage cheesebumps is called  That cottage cheese appearance is harmless and basically is caused by highly enlarged fat cells very near the surface of the skin While theres no cure for cellulite despite the many preparations creams and techniques touted to rid you of cellulite forever in general the appearance of these fats cells diminishes as you lose weight Your best bet to fight cellulite is to lose weight by eating a healthy balanced diet in the right proportions and to get some exercise You can start off easy but simply walking for 10 minutes a day Gradually increase the time and intensity of your workout and youll see the pounds melt away  along with the appearance of that cellulite Check out for tips and advice from experts and your peers to help you lose weight in a healthy way and keep it off for good All the best to you Sorry youre experiencing this Do you know what is causing the swelling For instance did you injure your knee in some way Or did it suddenly just balloon up Do you have a prosthetic knee knee replacement The reason I ask is because any of those things could cause swelling and the treatment might be different for each cause Youre doing the right thing by elevating your knee The ice is probably OK if you think the swelling is due to an injury Otherwise the ice is probably useless And at that ice generally is only indicated for a few days postinjury If this is a chronic problem youve had it happen before or if it doesnt clear up within a few days or if the swelling is accompanied by redness and heat in the joint plus a fever then Id suggest you seek medical attention Hope this helps and you feel better soon Im sorry youre going through this Pain issues can negatively impact a persons quality of life and in your case youve had to reduce your running because of it If its been a year since you last saw the doctor about this its time to go back For one thing you now have additional symptoms in the knee and heel For another thing even if the pain were confined to your hip the fact it has not gotten better over the course of a year means you deserve to have it rechecked Many conditions can cause the pains youve described Anything from to worn cartilage in the joints to could be the culprit If you dont feel your doctor did an adequate job in diagnosing your condition feel free to get another opinion I wish you all the best Your symptoms definitely warrant a visit to the doctor You might consider seeing either the orthopedic surgeon who performed your knee replacement or your primary care provider Things can and do go wrong with joint replacements of all types Pieces can break or its possible for them to become infected If you experience a fever redness and heat at the joint and continuing pain Id suggest you seek immediate medical attention Hopefully it will turn out that the pain in your knee is due to a muscle strain or overuse Only a health care provider can diagnose this so you might consider making an appointment soon Best wishes to you A can indeed be removed by surgery In fact thats a typical last resort step after drainage and steroids havent solved the problem A Bakers cyst is a fluidfilled sac behind the knee joint Thats why all of your pain is behind your knee rather than in your joint proper As to why your physician is recommending a knee replacement thats a good question Id ask him or her Sometimes an underlying condition like arthritis can cause a Bakers cyst to develop If thats the case in your situation it could be one reason why your doctor would mention a knee replacement as opposed to simply removing the cyst Im only mentioning this for informational purposes not in an attempt to read your doctors mind Id suggest you go back to your doctor and find out why he or she is recommending a knee replacement You may want to consult a surgeon as well to get his or her opinion about what the best treatment option is for you Hope this helps Im sorry youre going through this I wouldnt be too quick to selfdiagnose osteoarthritis Your knee pain could be caused by a number of conditions other than arthritis The very fact your sport involves a lot of knee twisting would lead me to suspect injury as a likely culprit for your pain issues Id suggest you have your knee checked out by a medical professional to get a diagnosis Once you know for sure what youre dealing with then you can work with your health care provider on a treatment plan that enables you to continue with your sport One thing I want to add is this Be careful about taking nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications NSAIDS like aspirin ibuprofen or naproxyn for your pain These medications have bloodthinning properties which can increase bleeding and swelling from injuries you sustain in your sport I wish you all the best Probably not The area youre describing the back of the thigh consists of a trio of muscles we call the  What youre describing sounds like a common spasm or cramp of the hamstring This can happen for various reasons  or no reason at all The hamstring would be an uncommon place for a to arise particularly in the absence of any other contributing factors such as recent joint replacement surgery Muscle cramps in general can signal dehydration or even a mild potassium deficiency so you could try drinking more water or eating a banana assuming your not allergic to see if that helps the situation If the cramping doesnt clear up on its own you certainly can put a call in to your primary health care provider for an appointment to have this evaluated Hope this helps You need to get this checked out by a medical professional as soon as possible The symptoms you describe could be due to an infection or a blood clot and both of these need to be treated quickly Either call your doctors office and explain to them whats going on so they can get you an appointment soon or go to an urgent care facility Im hoping the underlying cause of your symptoms is nothing serious but please dont delay getting this checked out All the best to you Im sorry to hear youre going through this Its annoying when our joints dont work correctly You may be spot on when you say your knee joint feels like its full of fluid That could be exactly whats going on Many things can cause the knee joint to temporarily fill up with fluid As long as you have no signs of a deep vein thrombosis DVT such as heat pain and angry redness to the calf area you probably can take a waitandsee attitude If the pressure and stiffness in your knee is accompanied by a lump on the back of your knee where the leg bends you could have a This type of cyst can be caused by osteoarthritis or an injury A Bakers cyst can be easily diagnosed by MRI though some medical professionals can tell simply with a physical examination These cysts often are easy to feel Since you dont have a fever you can be relatively assured theres no infection process going on If resting and elevating the knee dont cause the pressure to go away you should consider a visit to your primary care provider for an evaluation Wishing you well Good question A few ideas come to mind  Stage fright  Even if youve never experienced these before they can come on suddenly and without warning Did these symptoms occur when you were doing something in front of the class If so my guess would be you experienced an episode of anxiety If you werent performing in front of the class then perhaps you had a bout of low blood sugar hypoglycemia Even though you say you ate breakfast the quality of the breakfast can influence your glucose levels For example if you ate only pancakes and syrup you certainly could experience a dip in your sugars If you ate some protein along with some whole grains then it would be less likely you experienced a dip in blood sugar If you are otherwise healthy and this has never happened before theres probably no need to have it checked out We all experience occasional bouts of panic or hypoglycemia If it happens again or begins happening frequently then you should make an appointment to see a health care provider for an evaluation Good for you for maintaining your hydration Its very important to overall good health Im sorry to hear youre going through that Leg pain can be so uncomfortable Its hard to tell exactly whats going on without a physical examination but my best guess would be  This annoying condition can affect people who jog for exercise but they also can hit people who just once ran to catch a cab or something If the problem is shin splints the best advice is not to perform the activity that causes the pain So if this is occuring because youre walking fast for exercise try slowing down your pace If it just occurred randomly from a single activity like catching that cab then probably just resting the leg will allow for healing There are more tips at the link above Hope you feel better soon Im sorry youve had a bad experience with the emergency department Usually dont require emergency treatment so there was no harm in your trying to treat this at home However the fact youre now experiencing scrotal swelling of the scrotum tells me the problem has escalated and you should seek medical attention If you have red streaks on the skin around the area of the boil or if youre running a fever you should see a doctor as soon as possible If youre not feverish you could try calling your primary care provider to get an appointment soon Be sure to let them know whats going on so they can advise you if its OK to wait Hope you get this cleared up soon Im glad to hear youre under the care of a physician who is watching this carefully Any joint replacement carries a risk of infection It sounds like your doctor has things under control In general an elevated SED rate indicates inflammation somewhere within the body An elevated SED rate alone would not be enough to say your prosthetic knee is infected Cloudy bloody drainage does not necessarily indicate infection Presumably your doctor will culture the drainage which can take several days or even weeks to see if any bacteria grow out If there are bacteria in the drainage the culture will identify the strain so your doctor can treat the infection I think instead of worrying or being concerned you should be proactive about monitoring your symptoms Get a thermometer and take your temperature every day at the same time not when you first wake up in the morning You can expect some variation but if you start running a fever over 101F then its time to call your doctor If you dont get a sameday call back call again before the office closes Also be alert for other symptoms of infection such as loss of appetite feeling weak and general malaise feeling like you are getting the flu for example If these symptoms develop call your doctor I hope your knee problem turns out to be something very simple Wishing you well Any knee brace is designed to provide support to the joint so it should fit a little snugly However if its too tight it can cut off circulation to the leg which of course is not good Some warning signs that may indicate your knee brace is too tight Reddening of the lower leg compare the color to the opposite leg Purple toes or toenail beds Swelling of the lower leg or foot Numbness or tingling of the lower leg or foot Pinsandneedles feeling in the lower limb If youre experiencing any of those things you need to loosen your knee brace slightly Hope this helps Stay safe Good for you for persevering Navigating the health care system can be daunting but you are hanging in there until you get some answers Obviously I cant diagnose whats going on with you and frankly wouldnt hazard a guess at this point Its possible all of your symptoms are related but its equally possible theyre all coincidental Or related to something else entirely Some conditions literally take years to reveal themselves enough for diagnosis Some examples but I want to make clear I am NOT suggesting any of these apply to you lupus gastroparesis fibromyalgia This process could be what youre experiencing If all of your symptoms are related to a single disorder perhaps that disorder is manifesting itself very slowly By not giving up and continuing to seek care for your ailments you may be helping yourself down to the road to diagnosis I wish you all the best in finding out what is causing these perplexing problems Well this is an excellent question for the medical provider who ordered the Xray If the Xray confirmed a fracture of the patella kneecap then your health care provider should have given you care andor treatment instructions Unfortunately this isnt a question we can answer in a forum like this Your health care provider will outline all of your treatment options perhaps including surgery and you as an informed patient will ask about the risks and benefits of each option in order to make a decision that works for you Wishing you all the best Im sorry to hear this elderly lady is going through this She otherwise sounds like shes in very good shape I suggest you start with a trip to her primary care provider Thats usually the best starting point because the PCP has all of this ladys health history and can get her on the path to see the correct specialist if necessary Of course its impossible to say whats causing this leg swelling without doing a physical examination If I had to guess Id say its probably some sort of venous stasis problem This could also be the reason for the small ulcer on her leg Venous stasis problems in which blood pools in the legs is very common in older adults Its important to get this lady in to see her PCP as soon as possible Those little leg ulcers can blow up into ugly sores rather quickly so it would be wise to have it looked at Hope this helps Im sorry youre experiencing this It sounds very unpleasant Id suggest you get checked out by a health care provider as soon as you can The symptoms you describe can be caused by a variety of conditions some of them more serious than others Im not suggesting youre experiencing an emergency but Id recommend you get this checked out sooner rather than later If your calf or thigh hurts to touch and is hot red or swollen this could be the sign of a  and you should seek immediate medical attention Feel better I have similar issues with my right knee too but not to the extent that you have If youre overweight it could be too much weight put on your knee It happens to me all the time Otherwise I have no idea Ask your doctor I have recently had my knee replaced because it was bone on bone I wish I would have had it done long ago as apposed to waiting as long as I did Im pain free at this point I havent fallen and hurt my legs at time in the last few months No Ive never had that problem It really depends on where you were when you recieved the bites If you were in the grass I would say this sounded like chiggers which are tiny little grass dwelling bugs that bite you and cause an itchy rash If not you could be allergic to the bite of whatever it was Or you could even have scratched and caused a skin irritation from that Its hard to tell exactly without further information I would possibly suggest an over the counter hydrocortizone creamaloe vera gel or a good lotion and see if that helps Tonya Shin splints is my guess Tell the coach for tips and go to the doctor If they get too bad he might need to stop running for a bit He ll more then likely have to do a bunch or tests and might need to go to physio or an orthopedic doctor for insoles Depends on what it really is I had the osteotomy 10 years ago was the worst surgery ever and I have had a lot of surgeries I thought for sure they had amputated my leg I am now having a total knee replacement done next month because on am bone on bone and the arthritis is horrible I can barely hobble around I have had a partial knee replacement on the other leg and it was a huge success Also I had major back surgery 11 months ago and the limping about with my knee has hindered my recovery with the my back This surgery will be much longer than normal because of the removal of steel plates and screws I would recommend the total knee replacement stay away from osteotomy wish I had better options for me all those years ago Good Luck Could be Fibromyalgia There are medications for this I have it myself and know the pain very well Please see your Dr soon You should see a Dermatologist as soon as you can It could be a skin cancer and can often be removed in the doctors office First step see a Dermatologist Before rising to a standing position try stretching your leg out a few times before standing on it You may be sitting a bit longer than you think if you are busy and lose track of time and the stiffness is due to sitting in one position with lack of motion The entire time you are sitting do leg stretching by simply moving your legs out straight while you are sitting at a desk or in a chair If this worsens and you find you cant walk at all for several minutes after sitting for short periods of time you should consult your physician A viral infection should not cause knee pain and stiffness Does he have pain in any other joints If not he should see an ortopaedic MD and have it looked at He should try to excercise as often as he can by walking He certainly should not try running as running puts a lot of strain on the knees and the joints of the knees His knee caps may look ok but just looking at them isnt enough to tell if he has something more serious possibly needing in the future knee replacement He should try taking aleve or some otc medication walk as much as he can and consult his physician You need to see a physician about this IMMEDIATELY Write down all your concerns with both and take to your doctor Make sure he or she takes the time to carefully explain the pros and cons of each Ask lots of questions When you go be prepared thats why I suggested writing it down it is so easy to think of them when you are home then when you are in the exam room you will often forget to ask something you really wanted to know No matter how rushed the doctor seems to be take your time and make him or her take their time with explaining it all to you It is a big step and a big decision and you want to do what is best for you Start taking low dose asprin daily If you know you already have them you may want to take 2 If the clots go to ur heart or brain without breaking down it can be fatal I have the same problem Ive found that getting an orthotic for your shoes will help with the foot pain and before my shift starts I usually take a couple of either Aleve or some other type of pain relief That tends to keep the pain level down  Im not as stiff when Im done with my shift Its not uncommon I myself stopped growing at age 14 to have been 511 ever since Growth spurts affect everyone differently it can take long or be over in a bit No need to worry about it The best I way I have found is to use refreezable cold packs but nothing is 100 When using the cold packs I use an ace bandage between the skin and the pack and then over the packs to give compression to the cold pack This is the most helpful way for me I am also very active and using the ace bandages allows me to get up an walk around with them on if I need or want to After the cold packs I sometimes will use a hot bath or heating pad for a short time and then stretch and flex the knee to protect range of motion As a followup my thyroid tests have all come back find Im scheduled to visit an endocrinologist in two weeks and think that maybe another hormone imbalance may be to blame for all of my symptoms which include  Hair loss all over for about ten years but mostly on the top of my head said to be female pattern baldness which I dont buy Migraines have had for twenty years Knee pain in my right knee MRI shows nothing was told Im just chubby and getting older A fleshyfeeling lump in my throat barium test showed nothing Several yeast infections in the past year plus a UTI Blurred vision at times Trouble concentrating Trouble losing weight I went from doing nothing to exercising five hours a week and lost only 3 pounds in six weeks Anxiety attacks worse recently but have had them for about 10 years More recently in the past couple of weeks Ive been now noticing  Itchy skin mostly at night in the scalp back feet arms legs and groin pretty unbearable Heart palpitations Hand tremors Lightheadednessdizziness mostly after standing but not always Ive had so many tests but the only hormone tests Ive had are for my thyroid all of which came back normal Im a 35yearold woman and have had one pregnancy and hope to have another one once I figure this all out These things are really consuming my life and I really feel as though the doctors are trying to play everything off as coincidence but I just know theres something wrong If anyone has any advice or ideas on what might be going on I would greatly appreciate the comments Im just at the end of my rope and dont know where to go from here if the endocrinologist doesnt find anything Please help Jackie Have you mentioned this to your doctor You should mention it to them Elizabeth at this point I would suggest you speak to your family doctor if you have one to be referred to an orthopedic doctor or an orthopedic surgeon They would be the best person to evaluate and deal with your condition When you are at the point where you are popping the joint out of place or your nerve is pinched When we get injuries to our hips we tend to limpchange the way we walk That can throw the body off balance causing backknee or ankle pain So speak to your doctor soon Good luck to you I hope you get relief to your problem Maybe HeShes Had The Tummy Flu I suggest you contact your local State Health Insurance Assistance Program to gain a better understanding of the Medicare red tape youre referring to and what you can do to move forward with treatment if appropriate Find your local program by visiting the Medicaregov Medicare Helpful Contacts page or by calling 1800MEDICARE 18006334227 Possible Neuropathy in Hands and joints You should be checked by a Specialist to get the right diganosis I had terrible buring in my toes and feet I am not Diabetic but have Severe Nerve Damage to my Spinal Nerves and Spina Biffida Occulta After seeing a Specialist I was diaganosed with Neuropathy of Both legs and Feet caused by Nerve Damage and Chronic Sciatic A blood test can check for antibodies to the chickenpox virus varicella virus The presence of antibodies means youve had chickenpox or have been vaccinated for chickenpox in the past It would be best to discuss this with your primary orthopedics doctor Given your medical history of knee problems and procedures it may be helpful to get a second opinion from another orthopedics doctor Having copies of your previous MRI reports and medical records that you can share with the doctor would also be helpful You could have a Meniscus TearInflammation This happened to me a while back My treatment was cortisone shots every couple of weeks until the inflammation died down If it is very painful and chronic you can get an operation to fix it this is assuming that is the issue I had a total knee replacement in March of 2010 and I too had some swelling it will go away with lots of Physical therapy exercise and lots of ice Do you feel like its on the ligament itself or somewhere on the bone I had a similar incident and when it was xrayed it came up as an abnormality BUT they sent for CT scan and found that it was calcium build up When you injure a part of your body blood flows to that area and calcium tends to build up at the site At your age darlin I would say NO Have your parents take you to a foot specialist and possibly have special orthopedic shoes made Good luck God Bless There are many things that can cause swelling below the knee known as edema It is usually a result of fluid retention and can be caused by several different health conditions Cyclosporine has been associated with causing edema in less than 2 of the people that take it I suggest you contact the prescriber and notify himher of your fathers swelling They can tell you how best to handle it considering his past medical history First check with his physicians who have been treating him since February and get their OK to start exercising Also ask the docter who is treating his heart if he has any restrictions on liftsexercises that use his arms or chest Generally patients are not allowed to lift more than 5 pounds after pacemaker insertion for the first several weeks Also when you talk to his physicians ask about physical therapy or cardiac rehab Due to his extensive list of injuries and illnesses in the past few months a medically managed program might be a better option than home exercise I have pasted some links below that describe what cardiac rehab consists of http http After you have gotten all of his physicians clearance to start exercising begin with just a few exercises and increase the time he exercises slowly For example 1 3 times a day have him walk for five minutes around the house If he is having balance issues make sure he uses a cane or walker if one has been prescribed If not walk with him and give assistance as needed 2 1 time a day do the sit to stand exercise Have him sit in a chair and stand up then sit back down To increase the intensity you can choose a chair that siits lower to the ground or have him not use his arms If getting out of a chair is a problem decrease the depth by placing a couple of telephone books in the seat of the chair 31 time a day do a hip flexion exercise Sitting in a chair have him lift his knee and thigh upward about 6 inches To increase the intensity put a handweight or heavy item on his thigh 4 Start the sit to stands and hip flexion exercise with 1 set of 5 repetitions and slowly increase both to 3 sets of 10 repetitons Meaning have him perform 10 repetitions rest then perform 10 more then rest again and perform 10 more I know this doesnt sound like much but its a great place to start The walking will increase his endurance and the 2 strengthening exerices will make it easier for him to get up out of bed and from a chair Look for resources in the community Is there a silver sneakers program in your town or any programs designed exclusively for individuals in his age group Besides the benefits of exercise they also provide a great social outlet You definitely have some challenges but you should be able to exercise At this point you have 1 Get your physicians approval to start exercising 2 Seek treatment for you patellar tendonitis A short course of physical therapy could get you up and moving in no time for some info about what physical therapy is and how they can help 3 Look for a water aerobics class in your area Its a great form of low impact exercise easy on osteoarthritis and fallen arches On the first day of class arrive early and explain your situation to the instructor As long as youve been cleared to exercise by your doctor just do want you can without causing your symptoms to flare up More then likely the instructor will be able to provide you with some alternatives Also keep in mind any movement is good movement as long as it doesnt make your symptoms worse Anytime you have an injury it doesnt matter if your an olympic athlete or just an average person you have to  Karly This is not a question that can be answered in this format You really need to set up an appointment with your doctor and discuss it with them Sorry Your mother can definitely increase the strength of the muscles that surround and support the knee The good thing is it doesnt take hours and all of them can be performed at home Starting position sitting with both feet flat and her walker in front of her Exercise Slowly and with control come to a standing position Finish Position Slowly and with control return to the seated position Important Safety and Progression Points 1 In the beginning let her use both arms to push up 2 As she gets stronger and can perform 10 repetitions with little effort have her only use one arm to push up After that progress to using no arm movement to come to standing 3 Once that becomes easy switch chairs Chairs that are lower to the ground are much more difficult to get out off However when you do this allow her to push off with both arms and progress her through just like you did before 4 Also if loss of balance or dizziness upon standing is a problem make sure someone is standing next to her when shes performing this exercise 5 Start slowly begin with just 3 repetitions and progress to 10 Starting Position Sitting up straight in a chair with both feet flat and a leg weight attached to the ankle Exercise Slowly and with control straighten the leg like you were going to kick a ball Finish Position Slowly lower to the floor and repeat for a total of 10 times Switch the ankle weight to the other side and repeat Important Safety and Progression Points 1 With this one its better to start off with a very light weight and progress as needed as sometimes it can bother the knee Starting Position sitting up straight in a chair with both feet flat on the floor and the leg weight from the previous exercise lying on the thigh Exercise Lift the leg up towards you keeping the knee bent Slowly lower and repeat for a total of 10 Switch the weight to the other side and repeat Just performing 1 set of 10 repetitions of each of these exercises can make a big difference in her strength and mobility However its important that as she gets stronger that you increase the resistance lower chair or a heavier weight These exercises should challenge her but not exhaust her The key is to start small and build from there As with any new exercise program make sure its OK with her doctor before beginning There are different ways to perform knee replacment with less invasive surgical exposures that try to avoid incising the quadricep tendon the large tendon above your knee cap Most of the data that has been reported does only show improvement in the recovery in the short term This can be very important for some patients and less so for others There is no doubt that numerous factors play a role in recovery anesthesia type early initiation of physical therapy compliance with therapy and even patient motivation There is certainly mixed opinion about the true benefit of these techniques among surgeons We tend to advise our patients to avoid high impact activities following hip and knee arthroplasty procedures So we do not want people running or jumping if it can be avoided There really is no consensus opinion about activities following hip and knee replacement Different surgeons will allow different amounts of activity If a patient of mine wants to do some weight training I tend to advise them to avoid really heavy weights and focus more on reps I also tend to tell my patients to try to maintain exercise as they can because I certainly feel that the benefit gained from the exercise likely outweighs the wear seen by the implant It is certain that you will have less wear if you do not exercise at at all but that will likely come at the expense of your overall health For most people a knee replacement can predictably eliminate pain and restore function This is not to say that the operation is not without complications I think that we as physicians do a good job of presenting these complications to the patient preoperatively but I am not sure that we are always great at preparing our patients for the recovery after knee replacment The first couple of weeks can often be very challenging and the patient is truly doing a lot of work in physical therapy They likely are requiring pain meds antiinflammation medications and icing in between and around the therapy sessions We often generalize and tell patients they are about 75 percent recovered at 68 weeks and that they will continue to make some improvement often out to at least one year All patients are different and this schedule does not apply to all Unfortunately there are some patients some research has suggested approximately 1 in 5 that may have some pain in there knee after the surgery and when the recovery is complete Most of these patients are better than they were preoperatively but still not 100 percent pain free It is generally accepted that people can have a metal allergy and associated difficulty with a total knee prosthesis made out of metal It is a very hard diagnosis to confirm and the options to address it included a revision to a prosthesis made out of titanium and or a ceramic lined component There are times where a revision surgery like this really helps the patient and other times when it does not seem to help that much The questions of metal allergy comes up when a patient has knee replacement that is painful despite the fact that the radiographs look good and the work up for infection and loosening is negative This is a very tough problem for the patient and for the reasons outlined above the surgeon as well It is not that uncommon to have to have a manipulation after TKA total knee arthroplasty Most studies suggest that the need for this procedure after TKA ranges between 1 and 6 It is most important to act quickly after the surgery and make the decision to do this if the patient is having trouble gaining motion The patient is put to sleep and the knee is bent to break up the scar adhesions that have formed There will be some pain afterwards and it is critical to get right back in to therapy after the procedure Recovery from bilateral total knee arthroplasty can be very challenging Those individuals that have gone through it can confirm it first hand Like all things in medicine some people will recover quicker than others In our practice most people that undergo bilateral TKA total knee arthroplasty spend some period of time in a rehabilitation center after leaving the inpatient setting I like to think that people are about 75 recovered at 6 weeks but it often seems like people make continued recovery all the way out to one year following surgery This seems to hold relatively true for patients following single TKA and therefore you can imagine that the recovery process could be even longer and more challenging when both are done at the same time If you feel like you are making progress each day or week or even each month then you are probably headed to a good long term result There are certainly times that patients will get discouraged by the challenge of recovery but remember that the overwhelming majority of patients that have the operation experience improvement in pain function and quality of life I had a friend who had his knee replaced and it took approx 69 months before pain went away completely Remember you have a foreign object in your body The body needs time to adjust I have rheumatoid Arthritis It affects my elbows wrists shoulders hips and ankles There are days when I cannot open a can or even walk I started laying in a tanning bed two or three times a week for 612 minutes at a time This has helped so much I would recommend talking to your doctor They can refer you to a specialist that can come up with a treatment plan that best works for you Physical therapy has help me so much Hope this helps One symptom might be numbness in your feet Hi OK Its not such a big problem if you think about it just think sitting down and how much you can do from there if you need help see a trainer at a gym for ideas Now the next idea is to just go swimming thats if you have a pool you can get to swimming is all low impact exercising and is as good as walking for your heart and body Do hope this helps you Good Luck Hi Try going back to the ER ask them if you can have an MRI on it it could you have ligament problems either just damaged or broken If that confirms it it just a case of having tens treatment ice packing it 3 times a day doing swimming breast stroke leg work only with a float well help it I was doing 1K a day for over a month And was doing leg extensions twice a day

Psoriatic arthritis causes painful inflammation in and around your joints It usually affects people who already have psoriasis a skin condition that causes a red scaly rash especially on your elbows knees back buttocks and scalp However some people develop the arthritic symptoms before the psoriasis while others will never develop the skin condition Psoriasis can affect people of any age both male and female but psoriatic arthritis usually only affects adults People with psoriasis may also have other types of arthritis such as osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis but these arent linked to the psoriasis  See more at httpwwwarthritisresearchukorgarthritisinformationconditionspsoriaticarthritiswhatispsoriaticarthritisaspxsthashYsyo2DKRdpuf Try this site its very helpful and this link

bruises do not heal if there is damage to the tissue If you are concerned its something else you can ask your doctor about it next time you go in for a check up but I wouldnt worry too much about it for now if you are not in pain Of course you should rest If you have had problems with your knee before it might even be good to go see a physical therapist to try to also help prevent further injury

of the nerves so you really need to supply more information Until one has that information to assume anything would be wrong to state on this page The neck to finger tips may be a red flag for a nerve degeneration  but to be honest  this sounds like perhaps a circulatory situation Best to see your doctor and have a workup done Best of luck to you HI I am eight weeks postop and still have pain and swelling albeit much less then it was a couple of weeks ago I do exercises every day I also use the Flexinator machine three times daily for flexion helps relieve pain providing u can get thru the pain of using itits TOTURE LOL Use your pain pills do your physio work thru the pain and dont give up Yes I think that pain eight weeks following surgery is normal but you should also have shown vast improvement from two weeks postop FEEL BETTER and do your physio My father had knee replacements on both knees There is no correct estimation as to how long they last In his case one of them only lasted about 6 years The duruation differs by person and hisher medical situations For example one must consider the following factors How stressful was the normal daily activity of which the knee is involved Was the activity done more than suggested History of arthitis and injuries Weight and diabetes Family history related to weaknesses in different parts of the body Did the person need any additional knee protection or prothesis Each persons health and situation is different One cannot depend on any casebook sencaro This is between oneself and physician to determine what is going on and what is needed You will need to see an orthopedist for a thorough examination of your knee and probably an MRI of that problematic joint Since this problem has been going on for 23 years it is hightime for you to get it checked out medically The schools trainer may have just guessed and a guess is not a diagnosis The cervix can become friable and bleed for many different reasons so I am sorry that your GYN did not explain it to you at the time of your PAP I can understand your anxiety since you were sort of left hanging after that comment The most common reason would be cervicitis an infection that obviously involves the cervix and usually the vagina Many will simply selfresolve but this may also show up on your pap smear when you get the results A small amount of bleeding can occur during a pap and can interfere with results so hopefully you will not have to have a repeat pap smear As you mentioned the cervix can also be traumatized during sex so this may be the underlying reason I think it would be important to have a follow up with your GYN if you continue to have postcoital bleeding There can be many causes for itchy skin but one common cause that can occur in those areas would be atopic dermatitis eczema Experts say that atopic dermatitis is not a rash that itches but rather an itch that rashes so itching is the primary symptom Of course when these areas itch you will scratch This can create an itchscratch cycle that can only be broken by 1 take an antihistamine like Claritin or Zyrtec to control the itching 2 reduce the inflammation by using hydrocortisone cream and finally 3 do your best not to scratch especially to the point where you may break the skin This will set the stage for a secondary infection and make things worse That is really not a fever Temperatures can vary up to two degrees from morning the lowest temperature to evening the highest temperature I agree with your surgeonit is nothing to worry about And human body temperature is not affected by barometric pressure There is no thing called average when it comes to a personor a person who has knee surgery Every person on this planet is different when it comes to their ability to deal with pain and not all knee surgeries or the surgeon performing them are the same either So there are no average times for pain duration The ONLY person that could give you a rough estimate would be the surgeon who did the procedure  someone who is familiar with the case and someone who knows what kind of surgery that was done Your child cannot be adequately diagnosed without an examination A medical professional will need to see him firsthand a description is just not sufficient to make this important call There are literally hundreds of bumps that can occur on human skin In variesdepending on the thickness and amount of padding but a fiberglass short leg cast only weighs a few pounds I put them on but I cant say I ever had the urge to weigh them You can start with your primary care medical provider and have some basic diagnostic tests or you can be referred directly to a rhematologist I did not look at your picture I rarely find them helpful You may have a hypertrophic scar keloid and yes there are treatments for this You will need to see a good dermatologist or cosmetic surgeon  someone skilled in scar or keloid management He can start with his primary care medical provider While an orthopedist or rheumatologist could be needed the primary care provider would be able to determine which one would be appropriate based on his or her examination and diagnostic blood tests This may be a BAKERS CYST but you will need to see your medical provider for a proper examination There can be other causes of course Maybe Anything that throws off your normal gait or balance can cause a domino effect See your medical provider to determine a reason for your symptoms Keep in mind that a person can have more than one issue going on at the same timeyour hip pain could be totally unrelated so get it checked out You need to go back and see the orthopedist againthe same one that did your original surgery or a different knee specialist You will likely need an MRI of the knee at some point Call the orthopedistthe one that performed the surgery You are going to need to be reexamined today in most cases There are LOTS of other skin eruptions that can cause these symptoms but unfortunately I have no way of seeing what you have over the Internet Scabies is typtically transmitted persontoperson but it is possible that it could be transmitted on contaminated equipment There are skin scraping tests to determine if you have scabies but your doctor may not be set up to do it You may need to see a dermatologist I have to say that scabies typically does not spread like this nor is it common on the face so there is a good chance you have something else There is no way to offer you a patientspecific answer to your many questions since I have no way of examining your knee There is a good chance that your knee symptoms are completely unrelated to your foreign bodies but it is going to take a good orthopedic assessment and some imagining studies to see where you stand in this matter I dont know enough about your particular case nothing in fact to know if you are a surgical candidate or not I think it is a big jump from failure of antiinflammatory cream to the operating room however A choice of specialists depends on where the nerve impingment starts If it is in your back a neurosurgeon or an orthopedic surgeon would be the specialist of choice You should not take medication prior to surgery without the expressed knowledge and permission of your surgeon and anesthesiologist Some cold medications contain drugs that can speed up your heart rate and raise your blood pressure You are seeing the right specialistthe orthopedist You could see a different orthopedist for a second opinion if this first one isnt solving the problem Unfortunately I have no way of determine a cause for your symptoms or have a way of confirming or disputing your current diagnosis blindly over the Internet That would take a handson exam and some imaging studies  obvious not something that can be accomplished online Not without seeing it firsthand my friend Dermatology is a visual art Call the doctor again today I dont know which antibiotic or dosage she is on but if she is getting worse she may need a stronger doseor a different antibiotic That question cannot be answered blindly over the Internet You would need to have a handson examination by a medical professional or orthopedist to determine a cause and significance of your knee clicking Every person is differnet and there are not universal causes applicable to everyone Persistent knee pain lasting over a month from a jogging injury where there was a loud pop could be many things but a full or partial tear of one of the ligaments tendons or menesci would be high on the list as well as cartilege tears It would be in your fiances best interest to see a good orthopedist he should have done this weeks ago He may need some imaging studies like an MRI of that painful knee Contact dermatitis is a itchy rash caused by CONTACT with some allergensoap detergent perfume plant etc Eczema atopic dermatitis is geneticallydry skin They can both be treated with topical steroids like you are using but it can take a while to get it under control Contact dermatitis will continue to bother a person as long as the unidentified allergen is around Eczema can last a lifetime Go immediately to an ER Your knees must be xrayed They will treat you but you will be advised to go to an orthopedic doctor If youd rather avoid an ER visit Make an urgent call to schedule an appointment with an orthopedic specialist They usually do xrays in their office Good Luck Is this applicable to an individual with Parkinsons I have no idea what this is but I think you should go get

difficult to determinepain is pain but it may not be related to your past injuries A typical chiropractic clinic or center offers services that care for patients experiencing pain or discomfort in musculoskeletal regions namely the back neck head arms and legs While chiropractors focus more on treating said conditions they also diagnose the cause of the pain and recommend a short medium or longterm program to address the same depending on the nature and gravity of the patients condition Some chiropractors also offer onsite or home services for patients who can no longer travel to their clinic Still other chiropractors set up a free consultation hotline where they respond to chiropracticrelated queries from individuals I do not have this sympton You can do simple forms of exercises like sit ups and push ups You may also consider no surgery fat process to get back in shape in no time You probably need a colonoscope done to see if you have polyps that bleed May be some other  med

movement of knee Within the next few months I was experiencing swelling and pain on the outside of the knee with what feels like a knot of nerves that swell turn blue and hurt like crazy Icing it helps  but only temporarily It seems to be getting worse as time goes on and I am getting no answers or help from either my GP or the orthopedic md who did the surgery Is this something that just happens to the nerves surrounding the knee after replacement surgery Can anything be done now to help this pain My husband has been dionoised with rhomatoid and osteoarthritis what can we expect Look up the symptoms of Restless Leg Syndrome and compare with your own I have RLS and thats how I describe it to people However sometimes neuropathy can have a similar sensation sounds like lack of blood flow maybe possible blood clot If you are really concerned have an xray of it However it is not uncommon to have bruising in the foot just above the toe and under it since it is shorter You probably do have a fracture or at leased jammed Tape it to the toe next to it for a few weeks 46 if you are not going to the Dr for an xray It is to late to apply ice to it That would have helped with the bruising Keep it elevated when you are not on it That will help keep the swelling down You failed to mention if you have seen a doctor about this problem Coupled with you cannot lose weight without lowering your intake Eat more saladsfruitsand veggys Stay away from pastas ice creams pies cakes etcetc And you can do exercises in your chair Leg lifts barbells Every little bit helps you burn

Consider what your weight brings with it High Blood Pressure Diabetes heart trouble etcetc Your pain in your backknees and hip are more than likely due to being Obeseaka over weight Loose weight loose

of things to expect and questions and answer httphrmsupportcomdrrecommendeddrugsvitaminb12injectionshtml I had a micro fracture done on my right knee about 5 years ago It wasnt done on the femur but to the knee cap This was done to cause scarring under the bone where I no longer had any cartildge left and it was bone on bone The scarring built up a pad so I no longer have pain and can excercise with in reason The recovery was long Six weeks without ANY weight on it and using a wheelchair Then physical therapy On two crutches for a month and then one crutch for a month The surgery has put off having my knee replaced Hope this helps I would think this is a lack of iron in your body Maybe try a daily vitamin or iron supplements It might be a menicus tear I have one go to an orthopedic surgeon get an MRI It should confirm a tear in the menicus  I had my right knee replaced 11 months ago The surgeon will take several images of your thigh knee and leg and send scans off to some place that will design a customize replacement just for your knee  Mine was made of stainless steel My doctor had an actual one to show me in his office So I do not think that anything else would be changed I asked a half dozen friends the name of the surgeon who replaced their knee and chose the doctor most frequently mentioned  of course I asked if they would use himher again if needed During my inhouse physical therapy I met 3 patients who had both knees replaced  Jokingly I added that it sound like a crazy thing to do The responses were  since each knew that the other one would eventually need replacing 1 for insurance reasons 2 to minimize time taken off from work Hope this helps and good luck PS Since my right knee was replaced it took several weeks before I could drive my car You might want to take this into consideration Internist sounds like a infections I would say then its related somehow to the Sciatic nerve See a neurologist Im so sorry you have to go through the painbeen there and doing that I am 23 and I have been in intense pain since I was 12For years my gyno said it was endometriosis even though anytime he would do surgery to remove it it wasnt severe enough to cause the amount of pain i would still be in and he just said I was a baby with pain and i was faking I was 12 10 years later i moved to California and sought another opinion from a new gyno She gave me a PUF testwhich is a questionairre for bladder pain You have to score low on this test to be normali scored extremely high and she referred me to a urologist He took one look at it and asked me if i had ever heard of interstitial cystitis He scheduled me for a cystoscopy with hydrodistention He said the previous dr who had done a cystoscopy didnt diagnose me because he didnt do the hydro Turns out I have severe interstital cystitis I have no lining on my bladder and i have bleeding ulcers Ive had to change everything about my lifestyle If i would have been diagnosed sooneri wouldnt be this bad off Hopefully you dont have this horrible disease but i hope this helps a little You can email me at erinmariegoodfriendyahoocom if you have any questions or just need to talk I also hurt my back a few years ago I ended up having surgery but the leg numbness tingling kept getting worse I done a nerve test I forgot what the name of test was at the hospital and it showed I had nerve damage in back and both legs One doctor said it was because doctor let the disc press on the nerves too long I now have to have a second surgery because they failed to fix a tear between l4 and l5 Please make sure you see a neurosurgeon instead of an orthopedic doctor They really messed me up My damage is permanant please see a doctor soon so maybe you can fix it before its too late you may want your dr to see if your sacroiliac joints are out of alignment sitting does aggravate the pain and stretching the area is not good for them either if you are having a problem with them i am currently having mine looked at bc i havent been able to walk right and have had extreme pain in the area for over 2 years i hope you get some answers soon I am 54 and i had a TKR in 2001 best thing ever happen to me My doc that did my dc had me put no weight for 6 weeks like i had broke bone no cast did my rehab at home 3 times a day for 4 wks my knee still gets very stiff when i set in one place for over a few mins no I dont think so there are sweets out there that he can eat that taste like real sweets I eat these sweets cause I have type2 diabetics could be a local infection you may want to see a doctor I had a full replacement 15 years ago  its still doing well Because of COPD I dont walk a long way with it I am a avid golfer with a cart  the knee is just fine At 22 years of age dont gamble with suppliments and home remedies see an ortho specialist Ive had several knee injuries and two minuscus surgeries as a result of procrastination Get your knees fixed now so you can avoid an arthritic condition down the road Good luck Go to a chiropractor take Glucosomine and it is cheap through puritan pridecom They have the best deals Other problem could be your loosing bone and need to see a doctor Another guess would be your shoes good luck Yes it can be caused by the cold weather we might always feel warm but is the cold that is inside the body that is causing this pain and swell Aquatic therepy would help you no joint stress You can build up muscle in water problem wpatella check with your doctor to be certain but it sounds like you may be experiencing a problem with your sciatic sci  at  ic nerve It can follow the path from your center low back across your hip and down the outside of the leg to the ankle and foot It doesnt always follow the same path with everyone however that is what it sounds like to me I hope this helps This last year while I was at work and had just finished unloading our truck at mcdonalds I decided to have something to eat and sat in one of our booths and both my feet up when I did that I felt severe pain in right knee and when leg was straightened I did not see a doc for that I limped for about 2 days and iced it every night in bed for one week and then was better Ever since That time my knee cracks constantly almost everyday I also have had a sore left shoulder since 2003 when it was really painful and both crack numerous times a day Knee replacement is painful for about 46 monthsthere will be some swelling and the clicking is normal I had a full replacement in 2005 and I am now 59 years old The main thing is to keep doing your therapyeven though it is painful it will pay off in the end You have to have a good therapist to get through thisand you have to push yourself hard to maintain minimum loss of usage in your knee While I still have some problems with it especially when it is cold I managed to retain 87 per cent usage of my knee I can straighten it out completely but cannot do a deep knee bend No Pain No Gain I have a fused spine so I cant have MRIs What the doctors use is a mylagram organic coconut oil or a cocobutter stick and a bandaide clean with peroxide first  those are big injury but im sorry to say that you are going to be limited on physical activity when you said you destroyed your ankle joints are different from bones as it affects the movements when compared to bone that supports the structure are you properly resting stretching and putting coldslight pressure to let it heal i had that problem when i was in puberty during my growing spurt period im assuming its your leg muscle spasm and it hurts to wake you up at night only thing you can do is stretch before it get to that state bruised knee takes longer to heal than other bruised area if the pain isnt severe then rest otherwise talk to your doctor to see if you injured the jointbone so your daughter is getting bug bites and she is getting them even though she isnt going outside i think its bedbugs that can be infested wherever she is staying or could be mosquito inside the house that is hiding if it is bed bug that is serious problem and should be taken care of before it infest other area of the houseapartment I have read many articles in the past that sometimes when a virus is leaving the body is does so in the form of a rash But if youre still in doubt just call your drs office and ask for the nurse The nurse should be able to advise you I think you may have osteoarthritispain of jointsbecause your symptoms match the symptoms of Osteoarthritis To make sure if you have it or not you should visit an orthopedician YES go to your doctor the one that did the surgery he know first hand after xrays I would definitely look into and have retested by the Endorinologist I have dealt with unexplained pain fatigue weight gain Asthma symptoms Asthma Meds did not helpand many other symptoms and doctors were unable to come up with a diagnosis Thyroid tested fine etc I did find out that I have GERD this is due to vagus stomach nerve not working but none of the meds I tried seemed to help wthose symptoms either My diet doctor tested my thyroid function and found it to be a little low She prescribed a 14 grain of NatureThroid daily and the difference in my joint pain alone is amazing She also prescribed Phentermine which not only helps me lose weight but seems to work in conjunction with Thyroid Med My symptoms of fibro get even better when I am taking both of them I wake up feeling refreshed I dont have trouble walking due to aching joints I used to get so tired I would stutter and forget what I was talking about midsentence Even my stomach problems have all but disappeared Do the research there are many sites and support groups for Fibromyalgia online I would also look into symptoms of low thyroid mine was not that low and was causing lots of havoc Also I think finding the right type of Doctor for exmy Diet Doctor deals with thyroid problems daily and therefore is more knowledgeable is key I would get as much info as I could regarding my symptoms so as to be better able to paint a clearer picture of what is going on to the Endocrinologist you are

extreme swelling He actually ordered physical therapy and stopped it due to swelling increasing instead of decreasing yes sounds like he needs x rays for sure Can be caused by alcohol abuse or eating too much animal proteins in the evening meals this among many other issues If you are asking if you should have it checked out then yes you should Better safe than sorry I AM NOT A DOCTOR BUT I HAVE COMMON SENSE AND LIKE TO STUDY MEDICINE I think you have arthritis problem too much fat in stools cause by pancerous not working rightshe needs to see a Pediatriciannot a FAMILY DR could also be related to digestive tract issues no sounds like it may be have circulation issues If this pain is worse when driving or sitting long periods you may have a disc in the Ls such as L1 lumbar 1 the disc could be leaking or even gone and you have bone on bone in which case you are one tough individual I know that pain My surgery fixed that I woke in the recovery room telling anyone who listened my leg doesnt burn111 dONT SEE A ORTHOPEDIC DR A NEUROLOGIST that is atleast in the top ten will do He will likely offer alterior route that doesnt require narcotics Best of luck Are you being treated with a more than average share of steroids If you know u take that but dont know if it is considered excessive by pharmisit then ask your dr for an alternative because thats what they do My wedding day I wore a size 8  but my face was so puffy i looked fat in all my pictures Pickle juice Every football player in America can tell you its great for leg cramps Anytime you fall it is a cause for concern if you experience pain especially lower back pain You could be experiencing anything from nerve damage to a torn muscle I would suggest that you visit your doctor as soon as possible Only a doctor could correctly diagnose this problem through xrays It sounds like you quite possibly may have damaged something within your knee Get it checked out as soon as you can Just 3 days ago I had the same occurance I had just logged into my computer and minutes later a pain struck the left side of my back right by my left kidney I tolerated it for 2 hours as I was in a training class the pain became more intense I figured it was just a spasm then maybe its my kidney as I had surgery in 2000 due to a 5 diameter hematoma and 3 months ago I was punched in the same kidney by my abusive husband I hobbled to my boss to inform him and that I could no longer endure the sharp throbs of torture He had me to grab my notebook to study at home but the extra 2lbs of weight was too heavy and I nearly lost my balance I was not allowed to drive myself home instead a manager dropped me at the nearest hospital After CT scans blood and urine work they could only diagnose me to have acute back pain gave me scripts for Lortab and Valium with a injection of Morphine and Benadryl from the outbreak of whelps where the IV was stabled discharged me home where i was bed ridden and slept away 2 days They gave me symptoms of what causes acute back ache since i didnt twist it it also stated from prolonged sitting35 weeks of sitting with 2 15 minute breaks and a half hour My back couldnt take another day so why cant this be considered  workers comp well they termed me for a 3 day absence with medical document which is 3 points but you have to have 12 to be termed humm I had it done a year ago and had pain until 6 months after the surgery I do still have stiffness in the knee if it stays in one place for long periods of time Do your prescribed exercises and you should start seeing the pain go away I am having the exact same problem Did you end up seeing a doctor or getting better def see a doctor and untill you know whats going on i would stop running  try ice and heat packs to keep the pain down 20 min at a time if you see swelling ice if theres no swellling only pain heat   hope this helps feel better well its possible you will always have some level of pain due to this new work but i would say drink a lot of water as water helps keeps the joints lubracated and when ur off work try some heat if you have pain and try your best to take it easy  which i know can be hard at work vitamins will also help the better care you take of all ur body the better a chance you have to make this better  also try to stay off it when ur not at work  im sorry your going through this  its not easy  i hope this helps if u start to have bad pain speak to you doctor for possible things you can do  feel better try yoga the problem may not originate in your knee at all it may be from some other alignment issue in another part of your body that is the case for me with my knee pain it comes from my hips and other alignment issues i have also play a role the body is all one In my view you must look at the whole rather than just a part Yoga practice helped me to identify where in my body needs work I hope this helps Good luck I sounds like he damaged the ligaments under the knee Which only hurts when you pressure on the knee like kneeling of touching He should get it checked out soon The longer he waits the worse it will become because of inflammation under the knee This will cause the knee to eventually lock in a slight bent position and then it will be difficult to move and that is something that you do not want Possibly but could also be due to soft tissue issues with the ligaments muscles etc There is also something called a Bakers Cyst that can form behind the knee that might cause these symptoms Im diabetic 70 and luckily havent had an issue like this My cuts and bruises take a good while to heal but they do My mother had problems with minor sores that refused to healvery similar to yours If possible check with a diabetic wound specialist Often your md doesnt know how to address these things Her real problem was on her foot yours is the kneeboth areas are constant point of abrasioninflammation this seems to be a real problem for us scraps on my hands are always annoying I think when you have a new symptom and especially pain you should see a doctor Did your husband have flu symtoms such as congestion and coughing prior to the lower back pain My wife and I both have the same issue Congestion cough brought on by the congestion a day of pink eye and now the sore back Hell no Sciatica pain is the result of the sciatic nerve which travels down the hip down the backside of the femur Has nothing to do with the knee joint Its a nerve impigment at the hip level But it does hurt down the backside of the thigh Its caused by the sciatic nerve which travels down thru the piraforma muscle in the butt muscle which entraps it Its very painful and very common Doesnt sound like an ACL so much More like either a Bakers cyst or an aneurysm I dont know much about Bakers cysts but thats where they happen Could also be a ganglion cyst Ive seen aneurysms though Get it fixed By the way get a good doctor Apparently the surgical approach is important Just learned that recently for the Bakers Cyst Get a second opinion The lateral approach could end with tingling down the lateral aspect of the lower leg Small town doctor versus a big city doctor Just what I was told All due respect I also have osteoarthritis in my joints I have been using celadrin for the past 2 months and have noticed a huge difference in the swelling and pain level in my knees I dont feel the grinding any more either Maybe you can ask your Dr about this AFTER KNEE REPLACEMENT I FELT IT WOULD BE NORMALIN TIMEIVE HAD TWO OTHER OTHROSCOPIC KNEE SURGERYS AND FOUR SHOULDER OPERATIONSTHEY ALL HEALED 100MY SUREGON SAID TWO YEARSNOW MY NEW DRSAYS IT WILL ALWAYS DO THAT I suggest you get a blood test for him My daughter had similar symptoms that were attributed to bruises for normal play she was 3 at the time Her bruises first appeared on the shins and seemed to stay in the legs She also got Pitikia tiny red spots that are broken blood vessels on her chest and stomach area and after about the 3rd day she got blisters in her mouth that looked black like blood blisters A blood test revealed she had ITP a blood disorder low platelet count Her case was an acute one time situation but she was monitored with blood tests for 6 months Her case was severe requiring a hospital stay and medication to increase her platelets Im not a doctor just a mom with this experience Her symptoms were minimized by doctors until they got the results from the blood test and then they had me rush her to the hospital Better to be safe then sorry I suggest you request a blood test I have CMT CharcotMarieTooth Disease a form of Muscular Dystrophy and drink Schwepps Tonic Water to relieve leg and arm cramps Tonic water contains quinine at low levels I have found that when chilled the Tonic Water tastes similar to grapefruit juice Quinine pills are also available but I have read that gastrointestinal distress can result from the pills I hope this helps you I started having back pain a year ago they xrayed my back and found out I have DDD and I have a kidney stone Back pain can be caused by many things have your back xrayed to start with Yes repetitious work can cause problems I know from the type of repetitious work I have done in my life A virus may in fact be attacking jointsAsk doctor to tri antivirus medicine you will notice emprovment in two weeks How long must you be off of it before it is okay Hmm you need a little glue and they dont want to do anything Maybe a third opinion at a medical university would help you I hope you get answers Maybe its a defective replacement Has there been a recall on it In my opinion you shouldnt have to live with pain when you need a little glue Im a bolder wiser person who was close to death a few years back when a few local doctors couldnt find leukemia in my blood I knew what I had from research of my symptoms and referred myself to a medical university that saved my life Anyway My mother has had a lot of pain and swelling on her 2nd knee replacement I think the second one was done a few years after the first and that was about 10 years ago Doctors brushed her off til recently when they finally did an xray Shes going to a different doctor in the same practice I would have suggested a different practice but Im out of state Unfortunately the knee cap broke off and is on the side of her knee causing pain We dont know how long it has been there Im guessing years She is scheduled for surgery next month They told her originally that she would be in the hospital overnight Now it could be up to 5 days Ive got a feeling that they want to replace that knee again so Im quite upset about it after the 3rd surgery on the same knee Good luck to you with whatever you decidehave decided to do I had knee replacement in August 2012 and still have numbness from knee to ankle and stiffness and tightness extending around to calf I have similar symptoms of knee pain as you show I also get mine from standing too long in lines or while Im at work I was diagnosed some years ago as having weak ligaments in both knees I spent 6 weeks in intense physical therapy that included mild electro shock therapy on the muscles and ligaments Once I was cleared from pt they gave me a series of exercises to do on a daily basis and it helped One of them was to find a door way that has a slight step up or use a block to stand on and with your knee that is hurting slowly lower your other foot down to the ground and come back up about 10x to start with You also should probably see a doctor to make sure there is no issue as far as a torn or inflamed acl tcl or mcl no but have bulging disk and nerve conduction problems per emg test its ok its normal i work standing up for 10 hours a day n the same thing happens to me usauley a warm batch and some epsom salt that can help If your having new problems breathing go to an emergency room near you or call 911 The other information is not useful to further diagnose you without an examination andor tests If you have had a past medical history of blood clots or recent surgery you should call 911 imediately Use ice to reduce swelling as soon as possible If no improvement in 1 wk see doctormay have damaged sac under knee cap Im not sure but maybe it could be nerve damage "}
