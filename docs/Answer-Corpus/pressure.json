{"text": " Haemorrhage of eye is the bleeding of the eye and specially conjunctivaAccording to me your conjunctiva might have got damaged due to certain reason Conjunctiva is a soft smooth transparent membrane membrane covering the white part of our eye sclera  This membrane is vascular in nature and contains supply of blood vessels Due to extra pressure on the supplied vessels in the conjunctiva they may get burst sometime suspending the blood in the conjunctiva membrane This makes our eye red or pink blood vessels in conjunctiva are very much fragile Coughing Sneezing Straining the eye can cause pressure upon the blood vessels  which can cause flow of blood into the membrane  Your eye doctor is right i do not know Have been having problems with my chest pain since July 2013 went to heart dr he did heart cath said all was ok suggested I see gastro dr did all was ok ther I have continue to have these pains went back to emerg rm was admitted lost 26 lbs 3 weeks I have been week able to hardly walk cant catch my breath my appt is still off they took me off blood pressure meds said mine was to low also said my theroid levels were too high and lowered my doseg now I have started having this fluttering in my chest and my left arm starts hurting even if I try to move it can up please give me some answeres it could be a bug go into the ear or a ugly ear infection you should take her to the doctor and have it looked at doctors dont like to keep you untill your dilated 4 or contactions are 89 mins apartor your water breaks they always send you home at least they did me my sister and six of my friends like that and my sister was in labor for one and a half weeks AT HOMEbefor they took her and my friend just had her son 4 days ago and she was sent home three times even after they told her they could feel the butther son was turned feet first but if the pain gets really bad you should go to the hospital hope this helpsoh and good luck No sinus infection sounds like u have the flu or cold and sinus an infection both  Sounds like exercise induced asthma Ive never had asthma in my life but after recovering from a cold I was exercising and had an asthma attack My doc prescribed a rescue inhaler for me and Ive been fine since Just be careful that its not something more serious like a heart attack But sounds like asthma Go to emergency room now before possible seriously complications could KILL this person tiny debris could stop heart This is a vary big problem if it is still happening get to the closest ER but if not contact a doctor This Suggests Pre hypertension But Dont Worry Just Maintain or adopt a healthy lifestyle I think I know exactly what you are talking about Even if I bend stoop climb stairs too much I tend to get red dots blood splatter in my legs I have autoimmune issues but basically healthy and wondered if that causes these events The pooling of blood goes away after two to three days unless it breaks out really bad then it takes a little longer before it clears Sometimes it makes my legs throb but no real serious pain is associated with the breakouts Again any pressure of stress put on my legs causes this Of course usual answer is take to the doctor but you could also try getting him to drink 8 oz of water Also to be on safe side get a blood pressure monitor if you are able to So what did you find out Broken 5th metatarsal Insurance companies pay for medications when a drug has received FDA approval for treatment or there are advanced clinical trials Phase III and above which show that the treatment is effective What is hard for patients and families to sometimes understand is that insurance companies only pay for proven therapies not experimental therapies This is especially hard when the disease is cancer Fortunately the National Institute of Health and drug manufacturers are very involved in clinical trials for new cancer drugs or new indications for cancer drugs Clinical trials are very important because cancer drugs are generally very toxic and expensive and we need scientific evidence to decide on the best treatment options not anecdotal successes Because each cancer patients situation is different we want to make sure that a drug works for a particular patient Not all breast cancer patients are the same Some have limited disease some have advanced disease some breast cancers occur before menopause some after and hormonal and genetic characteristics can vary from patient to patient Afinitor everolimus is FDA approved for breast cancer in combination with Aromasin exemestane for certain postmenopausal women The breast cancer must be advanced hormonereceptor positive HER2negative and in patients who experienced a recurrence or progression of their cancer after treatment with hormone therapy using Femara letrozole or Arimidex anastrozole If your sister fits in this category then her cancer doctor can write a letter to the insurance company citing her qualifications Another important avenue to pursue for cancer patients is clinical trials You can look up clinical trials on the web site httpwwwcancergovclinicaltrials by cancer type and features in your zip code or state There are several ongoing breast cancer trials using everolimus Afinitor that may be applicable to your sister Talk with her cancer doctor about clinical trials and assistance in working with the insurance company to get the best treatment for your sister High blood pressure hypertension causes heart disease which might explain your chest pains shortness of breath and fatigue When the heart is unable to pump blood efficiently shortness of breath occurs as does fatigue Fatigue is also a very common side effect of many medications used to treat high blood pressure Nosebleeds can also be caused by hypertension High blood pressure causes blood to leak out of the tiny blood vessels in the nose Unfortunately most people who have hypertension do not have symptoms That is why hypertension is called the silent killer because the seriousness of this disease is not appreciated until hypertension has done damage to organs Your symptoms warrant immediate attention from a doctor It is very important that your blood pressure be adequately controlled and that tests be done to evaluate your heart Stress is the link between high blood pressure and high blood sugar levels Both acute and chronic stress can trigger high blood pressure and increase your blood sugar levels In an immediate crisis this is a good thing because the rise in your blood sugar level fuels your brain However ongoing physical and mental stress is bad for your health Talk to your doctor about treatment for your blood pressure and discuss whether stress is part of the problem Although blood sugars can rise in normal people a blood sugar above 200 mgdl or a fasting blood sugar above 126 mgdl when confirmed and associated with symptoms indicates a diagnosis of diabetes Your friend could have a pinched nerve or a badly damaged ligament The ligaments are attached to the bone so if she pulled some that is likely what is causing her pain If it hurts for her to tense the muscles this also makes me think that it is probably a ligament I went through all the test in the hospital I was told I had a heart of a 27 year old My doctor did not believe the test as he could not control my blood pressure They went in and found a blockagewidow maker They did a stent Surgeon stated I would have been dead within 30 days So much for test You can try red yeast rice and naicin Naicin taken twice a day can lower according to my doctor I take both and my readings are 9072 Try it capsules do not cost very much  You may be experiencing a phenomenon known a Tactile Hallucinations It is only a guess The name for this disorder is derived from the following two words 1 Tactile is the term used to describe the sense of touch 2 Hallucinations are false sensory perceptions that occur without any supporting environmental stimuli Sensory hallucinations can also involve other senses body senses such as taste and sight and have causes similar to those associated with Tactile Hallucinations Refer to the below links for other WebMd questions that I have answered httpanswerswebmdcomanswers5051457itastesoapwheneverieatordrinkevenwateridonottakemedicationsorsupplements httpanswerswebmdcomanswers5051154whydoismellsmokeandthereisnosmoke Yes Tactile Hallucinations are observed in individuals with emotional conditions such schizophrenia But some serious medical conditions can also be responsible These medical causes may include tumor growths infectious disorders alcohol or drug ingestion epilepsy and others Since I am not a physician I can only speculate on a reasonable cause for your false sensory perceptions Without knowing your age length of time that you have experienced these tactile sensations medications taken and overall medical history it is difficult to make any absolute judgments about your symptom I recommend that you start off in your quest for definitive answers by visiting your family doctor That individual may provide you with a physical exam and order some preliminary diagnostic testing They may also prescribe treatment options and refer you to other medical specialist Your blood pressure readings while being on the low side are not in themselves reason for great concern Years ago I was told that a Normal BP for an adult should have been 12080 I now realize that there really is no one normal BP reading that may be applied to everyone Instead a BP range of 90 129 for the top number Systolic where the heart is placed under stress with the BP cuff inflated and a BP range of 60 89 for the bottom number Diastolic where the heart is not under stress with the BP cuff deflated is a more reasonable approach in assessing abnormal results Based upon my definition of a normal BP range your last three 3 BP readings would be considered as normal With that being said something has obviously changed in your situation to reduce your BP numbers It is important to determine the cause for your blood pressure readings to have changed in recent days Have you felt ill What other if any other medical symptoms are you experiencing Have you recently begun to take any new medications Here are my suggestions  Continue BP recordings If possible have the BP taken in both arms while sitting and standing Try another BP testing device to ensure that the machine is not defective and is calibrated properly Also have a competent friend or relative assist you in the testing of your BP  Make an appointment with your family doctor to review your BP readings and to complete a physical exam  Normal eye pressure is debated Many eye experts use 1021 as being normal Your values of 23 and 29 are out of range high but not overly indicative of eye disease I know someone with glaucoma and pressures have been in the 40s With that background please allow me to answer your question directly Yes eye drops not laser are the preferred first treatment for high eye pressure value  I am not a doctor but will give you my opinions based upon the information provided with your question Sometimes fatty liver disease may cause hypertension Is your son overweight Fatty liver disease is often seen in overweight individuals and raises liver enzymes such as SGOt Another liver enzyme GGT when found in high levels has been associated with hypertension I suspect that the pediatric endocrinologist determined a high liver enzyme level during your sons latest testing of his blood serum I feel that the endocrinologist is making an appropriate referral in order to rule out liver disease for your son I have had personal experience in losing weight through following a diet low in carbohydrates and moderate exercise A low carb diet coupled with water aerobics should tend to lower your blood pressure A good place to begin your investigation into this mystery might be to first look at what causes most high blood pressure Those main reasons usually boil down to being overweight and taking in too much sodium  The following questions and your answers may provide some insight into the afternoon high blood pressure readings Of course it is not a bad idea to visit your family doctor preferably in the afternoon have that person take your blood pressure possibly have blood studies ordered and discuss your diet concerns Dont forget to show the doctor your blood pressure diary I hope that this answer has been helpful and wish you well  Your smelling of diesel sounds like a phantom odor that really does not exist in the environment There is a disorder called Phantosmia It presents itself in the form of an olfactory smell sense type of hallucination It can be caused by nerve damage to the brains olfactory system certain toxins and medications emotional stress trauma and viruses It is also a condition sometimes seen in epilepsy Resolution is directed at treating the root cause Without knowing with blood pressure readings age and medications taken it is a challenge to pinpoint why your blood pressure numbers remain on the high side Here are some possibilities Sometimes blood pressure controlling medications do not immediately become effective and need more time work their magic Sometimes a different medication will work better than the one being taken Sometimes the dosage needs to be adjusted Sometimes a 2nd blood pressure medication or diuretic needs to be added to the daily regimen Controlling high pressure also involves the patients conscientious efforts to make life style changes such as eating a nutritious diet eliminating sodium reducing stress and taking all medications as prescribed With the correct medications at the proper dosage being taken coupled with positive life style changes high blood pressure can be effectively treated Based on the information provided with the question your blood pressure is dangerously high You may soon experience stroke symptoms or other cardiac irregularities Please call 911 immediately to be assessed by medical professionals On site EMTs or paramedics dispatched to your residence may also evaluate your blood sugar level Good luck and Your blood pressure readings would be considered as normalhigh It is a good practice to regularly check your blood pressure I would consider the following steps to use that data for your overall benefit Keep a journal detailing the readings the time taken activities involved with prior to obtaining the reading machine used for testing and the time of day Use a different machine and vary the time of day for the test taking In a separate area of the journal list all foods and beverages consumed during the entire day Also list exercise activities throughout the day Drink at least 64 ounces of water daily Reduce stress in your life Cut back on caffeine and alcohol Do not smoke Take your journal with you for your next family doctor office visit Talk to the doctor about recommendations for weight loss By cutting back on calories and burning additional calories totaling 500 calories per day youll trim back by about 1 pound per week This time next year youll probably look and feel 20 years younger And yes I would almost bet the house that your blood pressure will also take a positive drop downwards I wish you happiness and good health It is a good idea to monitor your blood pressure on a regular basis The readings are most meaningful when recorded in a journal showing the date and time taken along with the site location of the machine that produced the results Our blood pressure numbers can be different from minute to minute and may vary if taken standing or sitting and show readings differently in the right arm or left arm It is also generally accepted that blood pressure readings produced by applying a cuff to the wrist area do not always produce reliable readingsIt is best to take readings at various times of the day and sometimes to use a different machine sometimes machines are calibrated poorly or are otherwise defective Hypertension is sometimes called the Silent Killer So it is not surprising that you experienced no overt symptoms with a BP reading of 170118 According to the Mayo Clinic sleep deprivation may influence the development of high blood pressure It is speculated that hormones charged with regulating stress may fail to respond normally when sleep is reduced to 56 hours or fewer per night There is no official set of blood pressure numbers that constitute a medical emergency Generally a blood pressure reading of 180120 or greater justifies a visit to the ER or Urgent Care Clinic A person should also seek emergency attention for blood pressure readings lower than 180120 accompanied with disturbances in vision headaches or nausea Your blood pressure of 170118 sounds like it was an isolated incident but should be discussed with the family doctor bring your BP journal with you to the appointment I am sorry for your illness and not feeling well It is not unusual to feel weak with cirrhosis of the liver And yes your blood pressure is on the low side which is more than likely contributing to your feeling of weakness Here are some suggestions 1 talk with your doctor 2 move slowly when rising from a sitting to standing position 3 Keep yourself hydrated Inadequate fluid intake can cause thirst and a craving for salt 4 Reduce your intake of caffeine to control insomnia I dont suspect syncope either Your pulse rate was within normal limits and your blood pressure was somewhat elevated With syncope the victim often feels faint the pulse may be rapid and the blood pressure is typically lower due to a lack of oxygen going to the brain The syncope patient may also lose consciousness What causes syncope as a symptom Stress intense exercise sudden standing after sitting or lying down certain medications dehydration physical exhaustion heart condition problems and other reasons I would start out with a visit to the family doctor who can get the ball rolling by ordering an EKK perhaps with a Holter Monitor run serum blood studies and refer you to other medical specialists such as a cardiologist  I would discuss your symptoms with your parents and immediately contact the prescriber of your Wellbutrin medication order Wellbutrin can cause side effects such as being dizzy feeling light headed being uncoordinated high blood pressures which can explain your headaches head pain confusion and many more Please open the WebMd link below to see a complete listing of sideeffects associated with Wellbutrin httpwwwwebmdcomdrugs2drug76851wellbutrinxloraldetailslistsideeffects  I know that it is difficult to feel sick and have no insurance Perhaps you can borrow the money from family or friends to see a primary care doctor and have some basic blood studies done It seems that the breathing of welding fumes can be hazardous and related to your medical symptoms A company called Plymovent talks about breathing in of welding fumes as follows The content of the welding rods coatings filler metals and base materials also greatly impacts your health The biggest potential threat is exposure to the manganese contained in fumes that are given off during welding Inhaling manganese can cause very serious damage to your brain and nervous system  Many individuals who are exposed to welding fumes suffer from Parkinsons disease a major disorder affecting movement and balance They often develop manganism a disease closely related to Parkinsons that also makes it difficult to walk and move properly Both manganism and Parkinsons disease cause tremors shaking and loss of muscle control These conditions can become more severe as time passes When the welding rod or base metal is iron or mild steel iron oxide may be contained in the welding fumes in addition to manganese Breathing in iron oxide irritates your nasal passages throat and lungs  Working with stainless steel may produce welding fumes containing nickel and chromium If you have asthma exposure to nickel can make your illness worse Chromium can aggravate or cause sinus problems  Both nickel and chromium may cause cancer according to NIOSH Safety and Health Fact Sheet No 4 American Welding Society Welding Fumes and Gases Center to Protect Workers Rights Welding on some plated or painted metals may be especially hazardous Welding Fumes Sampling Mine Safety and Health Administration Cadmium is often used as a coating on steel to prevent rust However cadmium in welding fumes causes the lung disease emphysema as well as kidney failure Cadmium Exposure from Welding American Welding Society Welding Health Hazards OSHA If you cut a metal that has been coated with paint that contains lead it may give off welding fumes containing lead oxide Inhaling these welding fumes can cause lead poisoning a condition in which you become weak and develop anemia a low red blood cell count Lead also harms your nervous system kidneys and reproductive system Lead ATSDR Some welding rods are coated with asbestos If you inhale asbestos dust that is released into the air you are at risk for developing serious asbestosrelated diseases These include lung cancer an aggressive cancer called mesothelioma and asbestosis which is a scarring of the lungs I dont want all of these many medical conditions to cause you great worry or to become obsessed with thoughts of doom I just wanted to honestly tell you what honest research has to say about breathing in welding fumes Of course your danger from incurring any of the above referenced medical conditions is probably directly related to the amount of time spent welding and the quantity of exposure material A fatty liver is reversible Being overweight is one of the many causes for this condition Lose some weight and lose some liver fat Hypothyroidism should not interfere with your losing weight objective In order to maintain a weight of 200 pounds youre consuming about 1844 calories per day To reduce your weight by one 1 pound per week reduce your daily calories to about 1344 Here is my abbreviated version of a plan that will enable you to eat better and lose some of the excess weight  Begin by seeing your family doctor and obtain approval to start a reduced calorie diet  Eliminating 500 calories from your daily diet can be challenging but will also prove to be rewarding and is achievable  Search the web for free 1300 daily printable diet plans Look for one that includes at least seven 7 days of planning covering three 3 meals per day and snacks Some of these diet plans may even include a printable shopping list and recipes to complete the main courses for each meal Look for diets that use a safe breakdown of calories 55 carbs 15 Protein 30 Fats  Drink at least 64 oz of water each day  With your doctors approval start a modest exercise program A brisk walk will burn about 100 calories per mile while gardening will burn an additional 100 calories in 30 minutes  Take steps to learn dieting dos and do nots Do not skip meals but do learn how to substitute one food for another and how to order a meal at the restaurant while not sabotaging your diet  Keep a diary of foods and beverages consumed along with a record of your weight losses  Reward yourself for accomplishing diet goal objectives have your nails manicured and painted get a new hair style or purchase a new handbag  Consider joining a dieting support group Youll hear success stories make new friends and will learn additional tips to making dieting a positive selfimprovement venture Best wishes for your success It is very distressing to have a hospitalized family and not know what is going on I hope that my response gives you some relief Without knowing your aunts age or medical history and having only some basis symptoms to consider it is difficult to naildown any specific disorder But I will try to give you three common possibilities as follows Pancreatitis  Inflammation of the pancreas usually due to digestive enzyme interference where digestion is activated in the pancreas instead of the intestine Although you did not mention abdominal or back pain it is a hallmark symptom of pancreatitis Excessive alcohol consumption is the root cause for the majority of pancreatitis cases Viral Hepatitis  Inflammation of the liver due to a viral infection Viral hepatitis may be acute with a sudden onset or chronic symptoms occurring over time It comes in A BC D  E types Obstructive Jaundice  May be caused by blocked bile ducts and is seen in some liver disorders I hope that your aunt becomes well soon and that you gain clear and accurate information quickly It is very distressing to have a hospitalized family and not know what is going on I hope that my response gives you some relief

ducts and is seen in some liver disorders I hope that your aunt becomes well soon and that you gain clear and accurate information quickly Multiple side effects exist for both of these medications These side effects are sometimes divided between common less common and rare Lets look at each drugs patient information sheet as supplied with the medication as it relates to side effects and your tired feeling  1 Gabapentin  This is an antiseizure medication that is also used to treat other conditions such as your back pain Unusual tiredness or weakness is reported as a less common side effect As an anecdotal point of reference I have personally been taking Gabapentin 600 mg 1 tablet 3xs per day for over 15 years without feeling tired Of course were all unique and medications affect us differently 2 Lisinopril  This drug is used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure Unusual tiredness or weakness is reported as a MORE COMMON side effect and it is recommended to call your doctor immediately My Conclusions  Both Gabapentin and Lisinopril both report tiredness as a possible side effect  Gabapentin less commonly and Lisinopril more commonly  More is needed to be known about your possible other medical conditions to eliminate them as a cause of being excessively tired  More information is needed as to when you first started each medication and when you first started to feel overly tired  Your blood pressure appears to be normal abet on the lower side is not a hypotensive reading and probably is not the cause of your being overly tired  I recommend that you contact your doctor assoonaspossible to report your feeling tired It could be a serious medication side effect or represent some other medical disturbance  Yes it can help your situation Having penile implant surgery is a major life changing decision My friends husband had the surgery performed twice the first surgical procedure resulted in lots of pain and a deformed looking penis The 2nd surgery done 4 years ago had more positive results There are multiple types of implants to meet your needs Here are the disadvantages and advantages as I know them to be  Noninflatable Type  A rod is implanted and is simply bent up to reveal the erect penis It is easy to use for individuals with dexterity or arthritic conditions The downside is that the man will have a constant erection the penis is always erect and just needs to be bent upwards to reveal the erection This can be annoying and sometimes painful This appliance can also cause a thinning of the penile flesh and can be perceived as having an abnormal appearance  2 piece inflatable appliance It is promoted as being easy to use because the man simply pumps it up to have an erect penis and pumps it down when not in use Fluid is transferred into cylinders which become firm and imitate an erect penis With this devise the penis is not as firm as with other appliances may be difficult to inflate and can cause penile tissue thinning  3 piece inflatable units  The appliance is pumped up for an erection and a release valve is pressed to eliminate the erect state Again cylinders are filled with fluid to develop an erection This device is promoted as providing the most natural look and feel has more fluid being sent through the cylinders to produce a firmer erection cause the least amount of pain and discomfort and is least likely to cause penis tissue deterioration With all of these devices the individual will never again be able to have a natural occurring erection My recommendation is to search out the most competent urologic surgeons and review the number of procedures performed and their patient satisfaction rate This process is best accomplished through internet searches Some urologists hold regular classes for men interested in having the surgery completed At these sessions all questions may be addressed and an opportunity to see how the devices work is usually provided Choose a surgeon that treats the individual postsurgically with recovery in a hospital setting for a few days Some surgeries are performed as a same day procedure with possible resulting complications bleeding pain urinary difficulty being ignored Additionally with the same day surgery the patient usually is catherized and must return the following day to have it removed In summary  this surgery can improve the quality of both partners lives Having medical conditions such as diabetes is most likely responsible for the ED Your situation will most likely not respond adequately to pills creams injections or pumps I suggest interviewing multiple urologists before deciding on the doctor entrusted to implant your penile device  HBP is known as the silent killer High blood pressure may be associated with diets rich in calories and fats excessive body weight emotional stress smoking genetics kidney disease too much sodium in the diet old age adrenal disease family history thyroid disease and other unknown reasons referred to as essential hypertension Does your wife possess any of the above referenced risk factors for HBP  The first step is to determine the cause or causes of the hypertension and then to make behavior modification and positive lifestyle changes How long has she been taking these medications It would seem that two different anthypertensive medications would normalize the blood pressure Doesnt it But there is an art to treating HBP with medication A physician must be able to try different combinations of different medications taken in various doses and at various intervals If one recipe is not completely effective changes may be made This process is known as titration We cannot change our genes but we can make daily health choices that are in our best interest Your wife should continue to see the doctor and have her BP checked work on exercising making positive nutrition choices reduce stress and take the prescribed medications as directed The neat thing about working on BP control is that to be successful one cannot help but to work on other aspects of their life By implementing these behavior changes she should see a reduction in her blood pressure and experience an overall happier and longer life You may be correct in suspecting paxil With that said my suggestion is to stop all medications and obtain instuctions from your prescribing physiciansIf you cannot reach the prescibers within a short period of time due to office volume or the hoidays perhaps your pharamist can phone the doctors report your symptoms and receive clear instructions on actions to be taken Your blood pressure would be classified as High  Normal  A blood pressure consistently at or above 14090 would be considered to be High Blood Pressure It is a positive practice to check your blood pressure readings But since only a physician can diagnosis high blood pressure it is recommended that your readings be periodically reviewed by your doctor That person knows you best and can accurately assess the readings The doctor can also make recommendations to keep your blood pressure within acceptable limits These suggestions may include controlling of weight limiting alcohol consumption cutting back on sodium intake becoming more physically active and reducing stress Your blood pressure would be classified as High  Normal  A blood pressure consistently at or above 14090 would be considered to be High Blood Pressure It is a positive practice to check your blood pressure readings But since only a physician can diagnosis high blood pressure it is recommended that your readings be periodically reviewed by your doctor That person knows you best and can accurately assess the readings The doctor can also make recommendations to keep your blood pressure within acceptable limits These suggestions may include controlling of weight limiting alcohol consumption cutting back on sodium intake becoming more physically active and reducing stress  There is no direct relationship to high blood pressure in children and autism Even though this is not the case with your son there is some medical literature associating HBP with mental conditions such as dementia In order to be considered as having childhood HP the individual must have a BP that is regularly above that seen in 95 of similar children I am certain that your doctor has considered the medications be taken as the cause Also probably considered have been obesity and a genetic predisposition for HBP Does your son have any other medical problems besides the autism My research tells me that HBP in children under 10 is usually the result of some other medical condition An interesting to fact to me is that a medication used to control HBP is used Off Label to treat autism  Attached below is a link for an interesting WebMd article explain the causes and treatment HBP in children A three 3 year old child can have high blood pressure Most children have some other underlying medical condition as the cause of their high blood pressure They can also be subject to being overweight and have other conditions that are found in adults with high blood pressure A childs blood pressure reading requires a physician to utilize charts to interpret the true meaning of the systolicdiastolic numbers The charts must compare the subject child exactly in considering age height weight and sex In order for high blood pressure to be diagnosed in a child their readings must be at least higher than 95 of similar children Of course blood pressure readings can change from minute to minute and should be taken during multiple office visits to validate the consistency of high blood pressure readings Without knowing the height weight and sex of the child an exact reading for high blood pressure in a 3 year old cannot be determined with certainty But according to the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute a typical three year old child would be at the 95 percentile for high blood pressure when the consistent readings are at 10467 Their chart should only be used as a rough guide as it considers only age and does not make allowances for height weight and sex If you suspect that your child may have high blood pressure a visit to their pediatrician is justified  Neuropathy caused me to be in almost constant pain and to experience frequent falls to balance irregularities I was prescribed the prescription medication Gabapentin 600mg 3xs per day with positive results Additionally the Gabapentin has been supplemented with the prescription medication Mirapex 050 mg 3 xs per day with even more improvement With these medications I changed from a hunchedover severely disabled person with chronic pain to an erect human being with bearable pain I suggest that you not give up and locate a medical specialist willing to invest time in diagnosing your type of neuropathy and to their possibly titrating various pharmacological agents until your symptoms improve You absolutely deserve a better response than the one provided by your doctor The best plan is for you to see the Primary Care Doctor That person can complete your physicalassess your blood pressure concerns possibly start treatment if necessary  and refer you to other medical specialists as needed While waiting to see your Primary Care Doctor I would continue to periodically take ramdom BP readings Start a journel to record those readings along with the date and time taken whose machine was used your own or a local pharmacy etc arm used for testing standing or sitting position and all recent activities that you were engaged in eating exercise etc prior to the testingShow the journal entries to your doctor during the office visit If you used your own machine to obtain the readings it is advisable to also bring it to your medical appointment for confirm of its accuracy There really is no researchable information available to determine the life expectancy of a 93 year old women with stage 4 renal failure But I hope that the following information will be helpful According to a social security calculator program a 93 year old female has a remaining life expectancy of 389 years The same calculator reports her chance of dying this year at 178 But these are only raw numbers based upon statistical averages Every individual is unique Even with her kidney disease being tired lack of appetite and hallucinations she could survive for some length of time or she could pass away shortly One thing for certain is that her pain can be and should be controlled I wish your aunt you and your family peace during this time of uncertainty Although I do not know your age or sex a blood pressure of 12365 would be considered for the most part to be within an acceptable range The top number of your BP reading is called Systolic and indicates the arterial pressure while the heart is beating or contracting while under workload stress The bottom number is called diastolic and indicates the arterial pressure between heart beats or during rest The American Hearth Association uses the following guideline numbers to assess the probability of high blood pressure Systolic Diastolic Meaning  120nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp nbsp 80nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspNormal BP 120 139 or 80 89 Prehypertension 140 159 or 90 99 Stage 1 Hypertension 160 or higher or 100  110 Stage 2 Hypertension 180 or higher or 111 or higher Hypertensive Emergency The Lipitor is being taken to control high cholesterol In rare instances high blood pressure has been reported as a side effect while taking Lipitor It is a good practice to take your blood pressure on a periodic basis and to keep a log of the readings Blood pressure can vary from minute to minute Therefore a pattern of blood pressure readings needs to be established Taking your blood pressure several times a week over the course of several weeks using different machines using different arms and at different times of the day will ensure the accuracy of the readings For professional feedback on your BP results take your log with you on your next visit to see the family doctor There really is no one organ that controls blood pressure Blood pressure is controlled through how much blood goes through your heart and a delicate body balance achieved through the Cardiovascular Central Nervous and Urinary Systems  Neurotransmitters in the brain signal the heart to beat quicker and increase blood pressure when it becomes too low The change in your heart beating then changes the volume and force of blood going through the kidneys and the sodium balance This action further impacts the fluid in your blood vessels and either lowers or increases your blood pressure  It is a positive preventive measure to regularly check your blood pressure You may follow the doctors advice on when and how often to measure the readings I suspect that 2xs per day should be sufficient over a 47 day period to see a pattern of BP measurements I always record the following data details in addition to the BP readings date time arm used sitting standing recent engagement in activities that I was involved with such as eating and exercise also smoking if applicable as well as emotional factors such as stressful situations It is then recommended to show your journal readings to your doctor for their assessment If you are using your own BP machine it is not a bad idea to also take the machine with you to your doctors appointment and have its accuracy verified Are you eating prepackaged foods like Lean Cuisine SODIUM Many of the symptoms you describe are vague and could be due to a number of things including Provera Some of the common side effects of this medication include weight gain weak bones headaches fatigue swelling These symptoms could also be caused by a number of things such as thyroid problems Its best to see your doctor to get evaluated and to discuss your concerns regarding contraception There are many options available This could be related to anxiety which causes different things for different people Since your symptoms seem to improve when youre not at work and youve only recently started having them after stopping the birth control and the cervical cancer tests I would suspect that anxiety could be the cause It could also ironically be a sideeffect from stopping or starting the birth control which can have physical side effects You can always visit a doctor if you are really worried or if the symptoms get worse but I dont think you have too much to worry about These books I have found to be very resourceful The Statin Damage Crisis By Duane Graveline MD The Great Cholestrol Myth By Jonny Bowden PHCNS and How Statin Drugs Really Lower Cholesterol James B Yoseph and Hannah Yoseph MD I urge you to do your research carefully  For your any dental problem click here  confidentdentalcare For your any dental problem click here  confidentdentalcare I am sorry you are going through all of that I know that blood pressure can be hard in people Im not a doc or a therapist but I will say that if you want to get out of this you will want to have less stress and think positive Stay strong and go on Instead of eating those greasy foods you should really just try do do regular small bowl of lettuce or a carrot or any kind of veggie or even a fruit I am not a bright one but I try to eat healthy When you have high blood pressure or diabetes I heard that eating fruit or a veggie will help You get healthier or better I am not a expert I am a regular person so ask you friend family neighborsbut eat healthy and you can may be get better So stay strong and go on If you feel uneasy or uncomfortable it is always best to consult your doctor Its better to be safe than sorry Goodluck  Could be I strongly advise you to go to your Doctor Call your Doctor they will have all the answers that you need for post op recovery YES what beta blocker or bp medicine will not cause ed I dont think that there is quite enough research yet to justify the claim that red peppers can treat hypertension The simple answer is that there never is one super food that should be emphasized more than any other to treat any health condition I would suggest looking into the DASH diet Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension The DASH diet emphasizes fruits vegetables fatfree or lowfat dairy products whole grain products fish poultry and nuts Its also lower in red meat sugars and sodium This diet has been shown to lower blood pressure in as little as two weeks for some people A healthy eating plan such as the DASH diet along with a consistent cardiovascular exercise routine can be part of an effective treatment and management plan for hypertension Consult with your doctor further and please visit the following website for more information httpwwwnhlbinihgovhealthpublichearthbpdashnewdashpdf One of the first steps in quitting smoking is to examine the different methods to become smoke free and decide which one would work best for you Some of the options include nicotine replacement therapy NRT such as gum or patches prescription medication like Chantix or Wellbutrin or methods like tapering postponing or cold turkey Do research beforehand to weigh the pros and cons of each method before implementing a program Next think about how ready you are to quit smoking on a scale from 1 to 10 with 1 being not ready to quit whatsoever and 10 being ready to quit right now Pick a number that best represents where you stand at the moment Why didnt you pick a number that was lower Here it may help to think about the benefits that you stand to gain from quitting smoking or your reasons behind wanting to quit What would it take for you to be higher on that scale towards a 10 then At this point it might help to think about what you would need to become fully motivated and put your thoughts about quitting smoking into action Its important to develop strategies to help you be successful What are potential barriers that may get in the way of your success and how do you plan to overcome them It might be helpful to tell your friends your desire to quit and enlist their support in working towards your goal No matter what dont give up Many people have several unsuccessful attempts before they finally are able to become smoke free because quitting smoking can be an incredibly difficult thing to do for some people The WebMD smoking cessation center would be a great resource for more information and for direction on where to get more help regarding becoming smoke free Talk to your doctor for further guidance as well There could be many reasons for why your friend is tired and doesnt have any energy I found a good article that offers some really good suggestions though located here  Encourage her to try out some of these recommendations and to possibly meet with her doctor if the problem persists Its natural for people to feel like they dont have energy on occasion but some modifications with areas like diet exercise sleep or stress might help to boost her energy levels Although consuming a moderate amount of alcohol can have some potential health benefits drinking too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure A moderate amount of alcohol consumption per day is considered 2 servings for men under 65 years old and 1 serving for women and men over 65 years old A serving is considered 12 ounces of beer 5 ounces of wine or 15 ounces of 80proof distilled spirits So the answer to your question depends on if youre male or female how old you are and whether youre having an appropriate serving size If youre already an alcohol drinker small amounts of alcohol may actually lower your blood pressure but this isnt to suggest that you start drinking if you dont already The potential benefits of alcohol need to be weighed against the possible detrimental health effects since consuming alcohol can lead to other health problems too This would be an area to discuss further with your doctor Drinking too much alcohol in one sitting can temporarily raise your blood pressure and drinking too much on a regular basis can cause long term blood pressure problems Keep in mind that consuming excess alcohol can also increase calorie consumption which could possibly lead to weight gain another risk factor for hypertension Its typically not recommended to start drinking alcohol if you dont already and its important to limit alcohol consumption to moderate amounts if you already consume alcohol Its difficult to determine causationcorrelation in this instance Some studies have shown that there may be a correlation between creatine and high blood pressure but there may not be enough evidence yet to support causation A function of creatine is that it can withhold water in your muscles and having more water in your body can raise blood pressure For this reason diuretics water pills for example are commonly prescribed to alleviate high blood pressure by eliminating excess water and sodium from your body Accordingly it makes sense to think that creatine could raise blood pressure I would encourage the individuals that you speak with to discontinue supplement use while monitoring any changes in their blood pressure There can be many factors that influence blood pressure but if they discontinue supplement use and dont notice any change in blood pressure after some time then creatine may not be the culprit Regardless if they already have high blood pressure supplementation is not recommended because both creatine and high blood pressure can cause kidney problems Excess protein in your diet can also cause kidney problems as well It may just be prudent to discontinue supplement use altogether as long as their blood pressure isnt within normal limits Of course I would always encourage that you suggest that they speak with their doctor first before taking any supplements My response is also just for learning purposes and is not meant to replace medical advice from a physician Read more about creatine here  Keep in mind that your blood pressure can vary naturally throughout the course of a day Exercise or physical activity has a tendency to raise blood pressure so refrain from taking a reading afterwards Stress can influence blood pressure too In fact white coat hypertension is a phenomenon where the anxiety of visiting with a doctor can raise blood pressure where it wouldnt be elevated otherwise Make sure that you are measuring your blood pressure on a regular basis and at the same time of day controlling for as many confounding variables as possible For these reasons measuring your blood pressure first thing in the morning works well for some people Also because your blood pressure can vary its important to obtain many readings to observe a trend or pattern The best way to check your blood pressure is manually through trained medical personnel The accuracy of automated electronic blood pressure machines can vary depending on the quality of the device Some machines may need occasional calibration or maintenance too To determine the accuracy of your home device take it with you the next time you go to the doctor and have a trained medical person measure your blood pressure manually and then compare it with your device I think this represents a very dangerous way of thinking Some of hypertensions negative effects on the body if left untreated include stroke aneurysm heart attack congestive heart failure coronary artery disease nerve damage eye problems kidney damage or damage to your arteries just to name a few Is it really worth gambling your health to potentially save money Consider this how much will your health insurance costs go up if you end up having a stroke or any one of those conditions from untreated hypertension For some people hypertension can be managed through modifiable lifestyle behaviors such as diet exercise stress management or weight management while others simply have a genetic predisposition towards having high blood pressure The bottom line is that although things like diet and exercise are always encouraged they alone may not be enough for you to properly manage your high blood pressure Meet with your doctor to discuss treatment and management options There are many modifiable lifestyle behaviors as well as suggested complementary and alternative treatments for high blood pressure Here are some Diet Learn more about the DASH diet an eating plan that has been shown to help lower blood pressure in as little as two weeks for some people Review the entire eating plan but make sure you decrease sodium and increase potassium magnesium and calcium Exercise Concentrate on getting enough cardiovascular exercise a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise per week The more exercise the better however Weight In general losing weight if youre overweight or obese can help to lower blood pressure Most likely you would achieve this through diet and exercise Stress Management and Relaxation Try Yoga Tai Chi or deep breathing exercises to help you relax and manage stress which can help to lower blood pressure Supplements and Natural Remedies With your doctors permission explore supplements like Coenzyme Q10 Omega3 fatty acids or amino acids Although there isnt much research remedies like garlic and hawthorn may be effective in lowering blood pressure too Its important to talk with your doctor before taking any supplements herbal therapies or alternative medicine Alternative Therapies Acupuncture autogenic training or biofeedback are alternative therapies that are thought to perhaps help manage blood pressure that you could research more about as well Discuss these with your doctor or another trained health professional Some of these different methods may have varying degrees of success while others simply dont have enough research to validate their claims You will need to do additional research and discuss things further with your doctor You may simply have a genetic predisposition to high blood pressure but it may be worth it for you to research additional methods besides medication to you help manage it Please visit this WebMD article for more information Yes they do The skin itches some before the rash shows up and during the rash and also when the scabs are present Definitely In a sinus infection the tubes which clear fluid from the ears can easily be blocked giving pain behind the jaw and below the ears I have had these several times now and once the infection actually affected my jaw itself Make sure that

see your Doctor immediately LIKE NOW  Alot depends on the type of tumor and where its located A tumor on the pancreas may very well affect the secretion of insulin and affect blood sugar levels Kidney involvement could affect the blood pressure Keep in mind that there are so many variables that can affect both blood sugar and blood pressure that are not tumor related Well there seem to be fairly instant physiological effects in terms of blood lipid levels and potential inflammation in the arteries after we eat a super high saturated fat meal so I would try to direct someone to cheat responsibly In other words even when we are cheating we can make better choices Like a guy is having his favorite steak and potato meal from a restaurant Try to choose a leaner cut of steak filet mignon top sirloin or London Broil for example and try to keep the amount of steak eaten within 6 ounces or so take the rest of the 12 or 16ounce steak home for sandwiches the next day He might be more satisfied with this smaller portion of steak if he has enjoyed a broth or tomatobased cup of soup andor a nice green salad with a vinaigrette dressing  before he gets to the steak  I wish I could explain this but its impossible to know what happened without knowing the specifics involved Percocet generic name oxycodoneAPAP is an oral tablet taken by swallowing Usually postsurgical pain is treated with intravenous IV medication not pills Its possible your postsurgical blood pressure issues had nothing to do with the percocet Normally low blood pressure in the recovery room is treated with IV fluids I dont know what reversal drug you were given for the percocet Im going to assume you received naloxone brand name Narcan I dont know why this would cause you to feel as if you were having a heart attack I could speculate but that would be of no use If you are truly concerned about this I advise taking it up with the surgeon who performed your knee replacement surgery He should have access to the anesthesia and nursing records that show exactly what medications you were given the times they were given and the dosages you received Perhaps your surgeon could shed some light on what happened Wishing you well Great question Blood pressure control can be helped by lifestyle changes along with medications You dont say how long youve been taking  but if its been a month or longer you may want to make an appointment with your health care provider to let him or her know your blood pressure is still high Are you monitoring your  If not it would be a good idea When taking your blood pressure at home do it at least 30 minutes after eating exercising or smoking If you take your lisinopril in the morning wait about 4 hours to take your blood pressure Thats about the midway point for peak effectiveness after taking the medication To help  you could reduce your salt intake stop smoking exercise safely and follow the  I hope this helps This is a very good question Thank you for asking Blood pressure is read as two numbers such as 11070 The first number indicates the amount of pressure in your arteries when your heart contracts in a beat The second number indicates the pressure in your arteries while your heart is at rest between beats The difference between these two numbers is called your pulse pressure For example if your pressure is 11070 thats a pulse pressure of 40 which is considered normal If your numbers are closer together such as 11090 you have a low pulse pressure In this example it would be 20 This can be an indication of poor heart function However the answer to your question depends a bit on how high the numbers are to begin with A blood pressure of 140100 for example would be considered high blood pressure even though the pulse pressure of 40 is considered normal A blood pressure of 180160 would be considered extremely high blood pressure even though the pulse pressure of 20 would be considered low If you have questions about your blood pressure in general I suggest you speak to your primary health care provider for an explanation thats specific to your case Take care The short answer is this Your father should continue taking all these medications until a doctor tells him he can stop Perhaps it would help to explain what some of the medications are for As you indicated the metformin is for blood sugar issues Part of the reason your dads blood sugar is controlled is because he is using this pill He should follow up regularly with a doctor regarding his diabetes and should get a hemoglobin A1C blood test every 3 months at the lab The is indeed a blood pressure pill Again the reason your dads blood pressure is controlled is at least partly due to taking this pill Its very important he not stop or decrease his blood pressure medication after having an angioplasty is a blood thinning medication If your dad had stents placed in the arteries of his heart during the angioplasty the doctor may want to keep him on clopidogrel for a year or longer This medication helps prevent the bloods platelet cells from sticking to the stents and causing a blood clot is a medication to help keep your dads cholesterol within normal limits Excessive cholesterol in the blood can cause clogged arteries and heart problems Sorbitrate treats a couple of different heart conditions including angina chest pain So as you can see your dad needs all of these medications to help manage his diabetes blood pressure and heart problems He should not stop or reduce his use of these medications If you have any questions about this please follow up with his doctor Best to you both It sounds like youre saying your friend was removed from life support and if so Im very sorry for your loss Im sure the family did not make the decision to remove the ventilator without a lot of input from the doctors caring for your friend A family cannot unilaterally decide to withdraw life support Ultimately that decision is made mutually between the care team and the loved ones Regarding pain You may not be able to feel pain if youre unconscious but pain causes a physical reaction in the body This is one way we can tell if an unconscious patient is experiencing pain As you noted high blood pressure and agitation can be symptoms of pain I encountered this frequently as a recovery room nurse when my patients were still asleep after surgery but obviously were experiencing a pain response To set your mind at ease about the withdrawal of life support let me just say some brain injuries cannot be overcome Brain tissue cannot repair itself the way most other body tissues can For example you get a cut on your finger and eventually skin cells fill in the gap It doesnt work like that in the brain or the heart for that matter When brain cells die they are dead forever If your friends doctors felt he was brain dead it means he never would have recovered no matter how much time he was given Again Im sorry for your loss Im sorry to hear youre going through this It sounds very distressing Unfortunately the only way to diagnose whats causing this problem is by physical examination I suggest you consult your primary health care provider to discuss your symptoms and have some testing done A number of conditions can cause the symptoms you describe so please dont jump to any dire conclusions until you see a medical professional Take care As far as I know there is no relationship between glaucoma and alcohol consumption Glaucoma is a disease that affects the pressure inside the eyeball Even though no one in your family has had glaucoma it doesnt mean you cant get it Not all diseases are passed through families genetically That said excessive alcohol consumption is very bad for you in many other ways It eventually will kill your liver and it can contribute to the development of diabetes If you have a problem with drinking talk to your doctor He or she can help you get treatment Wishing you well Im sorry to hear this It obviously distresses you and that alone warrants further investigation You say you have no medical problems but have you had this confirmed by a gynecologist The natural decline of hormones both female and male in a woman can cause a decline in sex drive A gynecologist can determine if this is causing your decreased desire or not and provide treatment if necessary If theres absolutely nothing wrong physically then Id suggest you consult a counselor A psychotherapist who specializes in sexual issues may help you figure out why your sex drive has declined Dont be embarrassed to seek this kind of help A womans sex drive is very complicated A skilled therapist may be able to help you sort things out You also might want to check out to connect with other women who are experiencing the same thing Wishing you all the best I would strongly suggest you consult your primary health care provider before you start taking with a blood pressure medication like  A handful of studies have suggested that CoQ10 enhances the way some blood pressure medications work which sounds like a good thing but it could mean combining CoQ10 and certain blood pressure medications could cause your blood pressure to go too low And thats not a good thing So hold off on the CoQ10 until youve had a chance to speak with your health care provider to get an OK Take care Have you had your blood sugar tested lately You describe some of the classic symptoms of  This condition can occur when you eat a quantity of simple sugars and the body responds by producing an excessive amount of insulin This overreaction by the body leaves too little glucose sugar available to your cells for processing Symptoms of hypoglycemia can include Nauseavomiting Sweating Dizzinesslightheadedness Fainting Shakiness Heart palpitations Blurred or double vision I suggest you see your primary care doctor to tell him or her about these symptoms Your provider may want you to take a fasting blood glucose test to make sure you dont have diabetes Meanwhile if you experience symptoms before you can see a doctor you can try eating a small quantity of candy or sugar to see if the symptoms resolve It sounds odd but if your blood sugar is low you actually want to add some sugar to your body  not a lot though Too much sugar can cause a hypoglycemic reaction all over again Wishing you well Youre wise to check your own blood pressure regularly after being put on medication for  Doing this will help your health care provider titrate finetune your medication dosage appropriately Clinically is defined as anything under 9060 This can vary depending on the fitness level and age of the individual If youve been placed on medication for high blood pressure you can consider a consistent reading below 9060 as being too low A normal adult resting pulse rate is between 60 and 100 beats per minute Its not unusual for a persons heart rate to occasional go above 100 beats per minute however especially during any type of activity or exercise If you experience sustained resting pulse rates over 120 then it would be a good idea to call your health care provider Because you feel abnormally tired and sleepy you might make an appointment with your health care provider to discuss your blood pressure treatment There are many blood pressure medications available and if this combination isnt working for you your doctor can try something else I wish you all the best Im sorry to hear your son went through that Im sure it was quite distressing The technical term for what your son experienced is   This happens to many people when they are about to get poked with a needle A vasovagal attack is the most common cause of fainting What happened to your son will have no lasting health effect He should be fine Your son can help prevent this from happening in the future by letting medical personnel know he has fainted in the past from a needle stick It is nothing to be ashamed of When we know of this in advance we can help patients to relax and avoid fainting during a procedure Your son also should focus on taking slow deep breaths the next time he has to have blood drawn This will help him avoid fainting Wishing you well I think you need to call your doctor and clarify why he or she prescribed this medication for you work to relax blood vessels by blocking the production of an enzyme in your body called angiotensin II While ACE inhibitors are commonly prescribed for high blood pressure hypertension as youre obviously aware they may also be prescribed to treat other medical conditions including heart failure Some evidence suggests ACE inhibitors may help people with Type 2 diabetes avoid kidney damage On occasion ACE inhibitors are used to treat migraine This is why you need to clarify with your doctor exactly why he or she wants you to take this medication And good for you for asking Everyone should know exactly why theyre taking a medication what the drug is expected to do and possible side effects Asking these questions makes you a wellinformed patient It probably will not harm you to refrain from taking the ACE inhibitor until you have clarification about why youre taking it However thats just my opinion and is not to be construed as medical advice I wish you all the best Im sorry to hear youre going through this My best advice is to go back to the doctor Even though the initial diagnosis was muscular pain thats not the final word on the matter If your symptoms are continuing to go on for months after the diagnosis this deserves to be reinvestigated It can frequently take several followup exams to accurately diagnose a condition Returning to the same health care provider who first diagnosed you would be a great move because he or she will want to know that your symptoms havent gotten better And you can also let him or her know about these new symptoms skyrocketing blood pressure and hammering heart Many conditions reveal themselves slowly so the more complete your medical history becomes with a single medical provider the more accurate a picture that provider can get of your health I hope you feel better soon I would say you need to have an oboe teacher evaluate your playing form It sounds to me like youre blowing too much with your facehead and not enough from your diaphragm You should always generate the wind for your woodwind from your belly not from your head or upper body You might consider doing some exercises that strengthen your abdominal muscles or core so that you can breathe in the proper way to blow into your oboe Im not an expert on playing musical instruments which is why youre better off consulting a music teacher than a nurse  Wishing you well Any time someone tells me they feel pain and pressure in the chest I advise them to seek emergency medical treatment Although its unusual for pain to radiate down the right arm its not unheard of Also from men Because your wife has had more than one episode of this chest pain recently she should not delay in seeking a medical evaluation A simple EKG test can tell her if this is a heart issue or if its asthmarelated Please do not delay seeking a diagnosis of what is causing your wifes symptoms Hope this helps So sorry youre going through this You have every reason to schedule an appointment with a health care provider to get checked out In fact thats the only way to get to the bottom of whats causing your symptoms You need to get a physical examination and some blood work done Fifty is a milestone age in terms of medical testing When a person turns 50 there are several screening tests they should get such as colonoscopy So even simply based on your age youd be doing yourself a favor to have a physical exam I hope you feel better soon I think you should call your health care providers office about this Your insurance company cannot change your prescription dosing Only a licensed medical professional can do that Please call your doctor or pharmacist right away to clarify the instructions for taking this medication If the atenolol is provided as a tablet its possible you may be able to split the tablet and continue to take one 50mg dose twice a day But I do not want you to do that without guidance from your pharmacist or health care provider Hope this helps The short answer to your question is yes the hydrocodone could possibly be contributing to your husbands sleeplessness Id suggest he go back to his health care provider and discuss his medications again to determine if this is the case Hydrocodone is an  Usually opiod medications depress certain central nervous system functions such as breathing Typical side effects of opioid medications include sleepiness However a few people might experience whats called a paradoxical reaction to an opioid pain reliever This means their body responds in an opposite fashion to the drug So instead of becoming sleepy from taking an opioid for example a person could become stimulated instead Its not possible to diagnose a paradoxical reaction through a forum like this Only your husbands health care provider can determine if this is happening with your spouse Your husband should not stop taking the hydrocodone abruptly because this can have unpleasant side effects Instead hed be wellserved to see his health care provider as soon possible to reevaluate his medications Sorry youre going through this I hope it gets resolved quickly If youve been on blood pressure medication for two years and the cold feet are a new symptom then its unlikely your medication is the cause However any new symptom is a good reason to visit your health care provider and get checked out Low blood pressure can cause cold hands and feet but its relatively uncommon More often cold feet are caused by poor circulation This in turn can be caused by many other things such as diabetes  or even  Your best bet is to see your health care provider to discover whats causing your cold feet After a physical exam your provider might order a few more tests to get to the bottom of this  and help get your feet warm again Its impossible to say what this might be without performing a physical examination unfortunately There are many structures such as and  in the area you mention These could become swollen and painful or it could be something else entirely If this swelling doesnt clear up within a few days or if you start to run a fever it would be worth getting this checked out by a doctor Any time there is swelling on one side of the body but not the other you cant go wrong getting it checked That said just because youre experiencing unilateral swelling doesnt mean its anything serious Lymph nodes for example often become enlarged in one small area on a temporary basis and then return to normal size I hope this helps Im sorry youre still experiencing pain after your back surgery Thats certainly not the desired outcome Im also sorry you had trouble with the Answers interface It does appear that your question posted just fine Regarding your back Id suggest you return to your surgeon for advice Depending on how long ago you had the surgery this pain you feel may be normal When a nerve is decompressed at the spinal root it literally can take months for that nerve to go through a cycle of waking up getting angry painful and then settling back down So please dont give up on the surgery too quickly In the meantime you might ask your doctor about physical therapy to help with the pain Frequently back surgery can cause the muscles to tighten up andor spasm Sometimes physical therapy can help relax these muscles and relieve the pain I hope you feel better soon Well without knowing any other information about your mothers overall health I can say that sounds like a wonderful blood pressure level for an 87yearold Usually blood pressure increases as we age due to some natural stiffening of the arteries Im not sure if youre concerned this reading may be too high or too low A blood pressure reading of 12065 is pretty normal The second number 65 is a bit on the low side but thats not a number were often concerned about The first number is the more significant one It should be below 140 and above about 90 If your mother is experiencing symptoms like dizziness feeling faint nausea or anything new and unexplained then you might want to seek medical attention But just based on the blood pressure numbers you gave and not knowing anything else about your mothers medical history I dont see anything worrisome Wishing you well Im sorry to hear your son is going through this Your best bet is to consult his pediatrician for an examination A couple of things Id like to talk about though First if youre measuring your sons blood pressure with an adult blood pressure cuff the reading will not be accurate You need to use a pediatric cuff to get an accurate blood pressure reading in a 10yearold child A heart rate of 136 in a 10yearold does seem rather high The same things that can cause an elevated pulse in an adult can cause it in children Obesity is one major culprit but your son obviously isnt obese Is your son symptomatic What I mean is does he have other symptoms besides the hypertension and elevated pulse Is he dizzy Sweating Fainting Assuming the blood pressure and heart rate numbers youre reporting are accurate Id say you should make an appointment with your pediatrician to get the situation evaluated It may be nothing of concern but you want to rule out anything serious Wishing you well Sorry youre going through this Unfortunately its not possible to diagnose this problem in an internet forum You need an examination This will determine the cause of the bump Many things can cause a bump like the one you describe If its near your teeth it could be an abscess If its in the fleshy part of your skin it could be a cyst It could also be something scary like a cancer This is why you should see a health care provider He or she will be able to tell you what to do to treat this bump The sooner you have a diagnosis the better Wishing you all the best Im sorry to hear youre going through this It just goes to show how negatively pain can impact so many aspects of our lives I commend you for being committed to your sexual health and marital relationship Youre a good wife for wanting to build that intimacy back up Id suggest you start by assessing what nonsexual positions are the most comfortable for you For example if sitting in a chair provides relief try adapting that for a sexual purpose Have your husband sit on a chair and then sit on your husband if that makes sense Another suggestion is to try having sex in a water environment such as the shower or a bathtub This may be especially helpful if warm water gives you pain relief Just be careful nobody slips You may simply have to experiment to find positions that work for you Do not be shy about seeking out aids such as swings or slings that suspend from the ceiling if you need something like that to help take pressure off your back during sex A less expensive and less permanent solution may involve plenty of pillows to prop and support body parts Again experimentation is going to be key here If you feel shy about expressing your feelings or needs to your partner please dont hesitate to consult your doctor a nurse or a psychotherapist whos experienced in sexual health to help with communication and to help you find solutions Believe me they will understand your concerns and treat you with utmost respect All the best to you Im sorry to hear this and hope youre under a doctors care Im assuming you are since you mention PVCs One thing that can cause a drop in blood pressure is taking too high a dose of blood pressure medication As with most medications antihypertensives need to be evaluated over time to make sure the dosage is still correct Sometimes as we age we need a lower dosage of medications in general simply due to our aging machinery The liver and kidneys may not process metabolize drugs as thoroughly as we get older for example However you should never adjust your own blood pressure medication dosage Only make adjustments when instructed to do so by a doctor Your heart issues also could cause your blood pressure to drop Whenever the heart isnt pumping correctly it can affect the pressure in the veins and arteries In effect when the ventricles contract prematurely PVCs it means theyre out of sync Theyre not pushing as much blood into your system as they should Thus your blood pressure may be reduced You should check with your doctor about how to handle the low blood pressure issue The situation can be handled in multiple ways and only your cardiologist can advise you how to proceed Wishing you well At 11 years of age the normal blood pressure range is close to the same as it is for an adult Generally speaking the normal blood pressure range for an 11 year old boy or girl is around 11575 to 12585 or thereabouts However this range can vary depending on many factors such as the fitness level of the child A skinny kid who plays a lot of soccer probably will have a lower blood pressure than a larger kid who isnt very active In that respect blood pressure in children isnt much different from blood pressure in adults If you have concerns about your childs blood pressure you should consult your pediatrician Hope this helps Well the answer to your question is yes and no One of the symptoms of adrenal gland insufficiency can be  which is a condition most of us have experienced where our blood pressure drops upon standing and we feel momentarily lightheaded So from the standpoint that orthostatic hypotension can be measured with a blood pressure cuff take a reading when someones sitting down and then take another reading immediately when they stand up and compare the two results then yes of adrenal gland function can be checked with a blood pressure cuff However diagnosing adrenal gland problems is not that simple There are many many factors to take into consideration Diagnosing adrenal problems requires at the very least blood testing and a physical exam by a medical professional The two main adrenal glandrelated diseases are and  both of which are very rare A book recently was written about a condition called adrenal fatigue However there are no scientific studies I know of that support the hypothesis of this socalled disease If you suspect you have adrenal gland problems you should see someone who is licensed to diagnose and treat such diseases  namely a physician physician assistant or nurse practitioner I hope this helps You need to seek immediate medical attention What youre describing could be a symptom of a or  Either one needs to be treated quickly Obviously the only way to properly diagnose this problem is to see a healthcare provider preferably an ophthalmologist Please call one as soon as possible and describe your symptoms so they will get you a prompt appointment I wish you all the best with this Im sorry to hear youre going through this Its annoying when our joints dont work correctly You may be spot on when you say your knee joint feels like its full of fluid That could be exactly whats going on Many things can cause the knee joint to temporarily fill up with fluid As long as you have no signs of a deep vein thrombosis DVT such as heat pain and angry redness to the calf area you probably can take a waitandsee attitude If the pressure and stiffness in your knee is accompanied by a lump on the back of your knee where the leg bends you could have a This type of cyst can be caused by osteoarthritis or an injury A Bakers cyst can be easily diagnosed by MRI though some medical professionals can tell simply with a physical examination These cysts often are easy to feel Since you dont have a fever you can be relatively assured theres no infection process going on If resting and elevating the knee dont cause the pressure to go away you should consider a visit to your primary care provider for an evaluation Wishing you well Im sorry to hear youre going through this and Im sorry to hear your physician doesnt have someone covering while hes on vacation If your mothers blood pressure stays elevated at that level all day long she should get treatment Those numbers are too high and youre right shes at risk for stroke I also want to say however that as long as your mother understands the risks involved with allowing her blood pressure to remain high and as long as she is not suffering from dementia or some sort of inability to make her own decisions she has the right to refuse treatment Have you discussed with her what her wishes are Does she understand she could suffer serious consequences including death if she doesnt get her blood pressure under control If she does then you need to accept her wishes Have you discussed your mothers wishes with her It can be a difficult conversation to have but anyone whos 81 years old needs to discuss these things with his or her loved ones Perhaps your mother wants every effort made to preserve her life for as long as possible Or perhaps she wishes to let her life wind down and die as peacefully as possible Those choices are hers but they should be communicated to her family If you arent comfortable talking with your mom about this you might consider bringing in a minister nurse or social worker to help have this conversation Youre a wonderful daughter watching out for your mothers health I wish you both all the best Sorry to hear youre going through this Unfortunately diagnosing this problem requires a physical examination A number of things could be causing the symptoms you describe Anything from an injured ligament to a bone chip could be the culprit If this is an injury to a ligament for example rest is the main cure It can take awhile for that type of injury to get better I suggest you visit your primary care provider to get a diagnosis Your doctor can tell you what to do to treat this if anything Hope this helps Im sorry youre going through this I can certainly understand your wanting a more permanent solution to the problem after dealing with the support hose for five years Certainly there are to treat  Im not sure why your health care provider didnt recommend any of them when you were first diagnosed After five years you may feel free to return to your provider and ask about more permanent options for your condition There may be a very good reason why you werent offered surgery to begin with Maybe it wasnt feasible for some reason But surgical techniques change and patients change Maybe today youre a better candidate for surgery than you were five years ago The only way to find out is to see a medical professional You can start with your primary care provider or go directly to a physician who specializes in varicose vein treatments Hope this helps So sorry youre going through this It sounds scary Even if your blood sugar levels tested normal during a routine lab test that doesnt mean youre not having episodes of  When you say my sugar levels are normal when checked Im assuming youre talking about a lab test Have you ever used a handheld glucometer to have someone check your sugar level when you experience one of these shakingsweatingpassing out episodes The reason your doctor specifically said to eat something sugary when this happens is to rapidly raise your low blood sugar levels Its not enough to eat just anything when these episodes occur Carry a candy bar or something very sugary with you to eat when you start to feel these symptoms coming on Passing out for over an hour can indicate dangerously low blood sugar levels You should not allow that to continue If you experience an episode like this again and your friends cannot rouse you wake you up they need to call 911 immediately I would strongly recommend going back to the doctor to have your symptoms reevaluated if eating sugar isnt helping when you have one of these episodes By the way your blood pressure and pulse numbers look very good which is why your doctor wasnt concerned I hope this helps Well those lab results are a little high Keyword little Theyre not off the charts by any means The normal reference range for is 720 mgdl and the range for serum blood creatinine for a male is 07  14 mgdl So you can see yours are higher than normal but only your health care provider can interpret these results relative to your medical history Thats the key point here These results may be not good for one person but OK for another Keep in mind dehydration can cause BUN to rise so its possible thats the only thing that is going on here Both BUN and creatinine measure kidney function by the way Your health care provider should have more information for you at your followup appointment If your situation were dire your provider would have called you immediately with instructions on what to do Hope this helps My best answer is You should not discontinue without consulting your physician A stress test alone cannot tell you there is no build up of plaque in your arteries Im glad your stress test result was good but your total number is a bit high Its not outrageous though and that fact warrants a discussion with your physician If your health care provider feels you need to be on a cholesterollowering drug there are many alternatives to simvastatin Your provider can advise you how to discontinue the simvastatin and start a new medication if needed You might also check out to see how others have handled their borderline high cholesterol issues what medications they take and how they talked to their doctor about their choices of cholesterollowering drugs Take care In short yes it can One of the known side effects of is lowered blood pressure Hydrocodone is an opioid medication It works to relieve pain by occupying certain receptors within the nervous system In general opioid medications tend to slow everything down they can cause sleepiness slower breathing slower heart rate and yes lower blood pressure However hydrocodone is prescribed for pain It is not an antihypertensive drug per se In other words its not prescribed specifically to help lower blood pressure in a person with high blood pressure That job is left to other medications designed for that purpose If youre experiencing any intolerable side effects with your hydrocodone usage please consult with your health care provider He or she can help you determine if another medication might work better for you with fewer side effects Good luck That kind of weird isnt it Unfortunately only a physical examination can help figure out what those marks are From your description they almost sound like stretch marks but the shin would be a very odd place to find stretch marks Id suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider to get them looked at I dont think theyre the hallmark of anything serious but Im not a doctor A physician nurse practitioner or physician assistant might see these marks as a sign of some other condition Thats why Im suggesting you see a doctor This isnt an emergency situation but its worth getting checked out I realize this answer is unsatisfying but I hope you find it helpful Some ethic groups develop gout as side effect for more and cure you can visit on wwwglobalbgcbwebscom I would check the side effects of all medications you are taking and see if any have those symptoms listed I just checked my new medications today and some of them say that if I get up too quickly that I can have the same affects no too low My advice to you is to talk with your dietitian at the center you are receiving your treatments The renal diet is very strict and it is also unclear as how you want to use it Do you want to smoke it or eat it Hello An ear infection is usually limited to the ear You may have a runny nose  nasal congestion with it but it should go away within 10 days If it is viral antibiotics are not needed if it is bacterial antibiotics will help Since you have additional symptoms and it has been going on for 2 weeks it is important you see a doctor Flushing and chest tightness is not a part of an ear infection so see your doctor so she can examine you to find out why this is happening It can yes actually it is never ok to smoke weed unless it is prescribed by a doctor as for mixing it with prescription meds I dont see how that could be safe why risk it Antihistamine medications that are NOT combined with other medications are safe to take with blood pressure medications and should not affect your blood pressure We tend to be more concerned about nasal decongestants affecting blood pressure more than the antihistamines when treating allergy symptoms I suggest working with your local pharmacist to help select a product for the specific symptoms you are trying to treat that would not affect your blood pressure There are several types of probiotics available over the counter It is always important to inform your healthcare professional and your pharmacist about which types of probiotics you are taking However the two medications lisinopril and Levoxyl currently do not interfere with any of the probiotics available on the market It is important to check with your pharmacist about any updates concerning drug interactions between these medications Common side effects for lisinopril are cough diarrhea dizziness headache and tiredness Many of these side effects wear off about 23 weeks after starting the medication I would see if the side effects wear off If the side effects become too cumbersome you may want to talk to the prescriber to see if you can be prescribed another blood pressure medication Separate from the issue of sun sensitivity there are so many choices of blood pressure medication that can be examined in order to make sure the correct products has been selected for you But we do not want to completely change your therapy if it is working for you There may be another drug in the same class as the one you are currently taking that is less sunsensitive and that can be just as effective for treatment Be cautious in changing drug classes entirely Work with your healthcare professional and your pharmacist to find the right treatment for you Close My friend is taking Melatonin at night and her blood pressure meds in the am as per her doctor I was at diabetes educational class yesterday They said 13080 is the goal You are right about there Congrats The problem you are describing could be related to your meds even if youve been on them for a while our bodies change and meds can accumulate over time so what was Not a problem at one time or at a lower dose may eventually become an issue Check with your doctor to see if this is likely and if so if there is another alternative medicine you can try Also you may just be experiencing typical loss of penis sensitivity which happens to men over time Try using a top drawer penis health cream health professionals recommend Man1 Man Oil What you want is a cream that includes acetyl L carnitine this is an ingredient that is neuroprotective and is useful in restoring penis sensitivity Good luck Sounds like maybe you are if you havent starting your period and if you already have it sometimes in approx 2 weeks after your period stops you get a cramp like feeling from your ovaries doing there job 10553 Hi it is common to lose your erection if you have any concerns or worries  or if you have a heavy work load and when youre not feeling well Sex requires a huge amount of energy output from your brain and if youre already feeling tired or distracted then your brain is redirecting the required energy to other parts of your body  equating to no erection ED medications usually make a premature ejaculation problem worse What you need to do is to stay in what I call the safety zone of arousal during sex so you dont accidentally overstimulate your brain with sexual thoughts and feelings which is what makes you ejaculate early A newly published survey reported that 19 of young adults about one in five have high blood pressure  with readings greater than 14090 Researchers from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill surveyed over 14000 young men and women aged 24 to 32 and were surprised to find a higher prevalence than the less worrisome 4 previously reported from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey NHANES It is unclear why these numbers differ but the message is clear High blood pressure is more common than we think In fact only 11 of the individuals surveyed had been told that they had high blood pressure That means that almost half of the young adults walking around with a significant risk factor for heart attack and stroke dont even know it If a betablocker is associated with ED Id suggest switching to a different blood pressure medication rather than turning to a medication to treat the ED Fortunately there are lots of alternatives that are not generally associated with ED side effects like diuretics ACE inhibitors and others Symptoms like chest pain that come on during walking or other exertion can be a sign of heart disease I recommend that you call your doctor now Even if you do not have risk factors like diabetes or high blood pressure you could still have heart disease or another condition causing your symptoms Its important to make sure that water retention is not a result of abnormal kidney function abnormal heart function or abnormal liver function There are medications that can help with swelling  they tend to impact blood pressure and can sometimes impact kidney function  so important to talk about with your doctor Take care Any of the OTC medications that people take for headache and fever will help for someone that has hypertension just be sure and read the label carefully There are many brands of medications on the market that say you can safely take if you have high blood pressure just be sure you choose one that is safe for someone to take that has high blood pressure Also check your blood pressure more often than usual while taking medication Listen until you no longer hear it at all then record your reading I would wait about ten minutes then it should be just fine Just be sure to stop immediately if you start feeling light headed or dizzy Other than that you should be ok to go ahead with your exercise Hi I have had 4 previous pregnancies I have children aged 10 8 4 and 2 With my second I tested negative for pregnancy this was picked up by blood test when I went to the Doctor for pain The hgc levels rose too slowly and they thought him to be eptopic but then found him behind a large cyst I was 8 weeks My pregnancies with my last two girls I had 2 periods or period type bleeds with each My period was due on the 9th of January I am usually quite regular Instead I had pain in my lower right ovary location and headaches and cramps all the signs of a period My period then arrived on the 13th I started to feel sick the pain on the left increased and I also had pain in the right My period lasted 3 days and was half its normal flow or at least I used half the pads maybe less than half changing them to be clean rather than them being full I went to the Doctor he put me on the pill and said to come back in two weeks In the last week I am having cramps they feel like braxton hicks this is the only thing I am able to relate them too I have pressure down there The pain on both the left and the right has gone I am now feeling a bulge above my pubic bone it seems to be a pointed bulge It is bigger before I urinate and when I am standing and my jeans have become uncomfortable I still have a week before I go back to the Doctor but this is worrying me now I feel more sick every day but I understand this could be nerves I do not think I am a candidate for hysterical pregnancy I did suffer 2 weeks feeling incredibly broody in early December but quickly resorted back to my feeling of not wanting any more monsters lol The Doctor put me on the pill to ease my pregnancy symptoms and said to come back if the pain persists but it has stopped Is there anything you can tell me to put my mind at rest My Doctor gave me a look I am nervous about waiting to go back and nervous to go back in case he thinks I am wasting his time Thankyou Jasmine I forgot to mention that I had pre cancerous cells burnt away last year It could be a hairline fracture or your kneecap may have been briefly dislocated without you knowing it like when youre sleeping I have dislocated my knees before and they hurt like that when either A theyre about to dislocate again soon or B they must have popped out for a second in the middle of the night Im assuming I think its best to just go easy on your knees Definitely dont kneel whether its a nerve fracture or dislocation kneeling will not help Just move your leg carefully dont jerk it suddenly to the side which could make it dislocate again if thats whats wrong in the first place If the pain persists for another week you should probably go to the doctor or a chiropractor  A healthy blood pressure should be less than 120 mm Hg systolic and less than 80 mm Hg diastolic A normal pulse rate for adults is 60 to 100 beats a minute You should speak with your doctor about your blood pressure reading and pulse rate yes you need to seek medical attention Nope you will not be able to play if you just leave the pain You must see your doctor and tell himher what you have The doctor should give you something for your foot Your ear is connected to your Eustachian tube which on its turn connect to your pharynx running close by your nose on its way The tube requires four essential muscles to operate Yes but keep in mind most at least in the usa most formulations are mixed with something else and pure hydrocodone is hard to come by as they are all mixed with Definitely see a doctor about this They might refer you to a neurologist if they think its needed I the same symptoms and more on top of those and I did need to have some tests done Im experiencing the same thing herniated C5C6 with pressure on spinal cord severe pain numb face and doubled BP X Hoping for others to post and perhaps a doctor to weigh in This is a great question Well when patients come to me at the pharmacy I always have to ask them a few other questions like what are their symptoms What they may think is a cold I may think its different So I try to find out what is going on Do they really have a stuffy nose Is it just a cough Based on that I can pick the appropriate products to help them feel better The physician may recommend for them to use a product like Sudafed or Sudafed PE and thats okay But once again the physician or healthcare provider makes that recommendation and as long as they are testing their blood pressure at home I would say to them if you are taking this medicine start using your diary again make sure it doesnt go up The minute you see your blood pressure go up you need to discontinue it There is a product called Coricidin HBP which is actually made for people with high blood pressure but it doesnt have any nasal decongestant in it So if you have a stuffy nose usually either I say to them you could try using like a vaporizer or you can use a Saline spray Those dont contain any drugs so they are okay to use in people with high blood pressure We have a patient here who has two very serious medical conditions diabetes and high blood pressure Most likely too as a pharmacist I am going to ask on what medications theyre on and I guarantee theyre on quite a few With Acai Berry we dont have any data on whether or not it interacts with medications and when you have something like cardiovascular disease and diabetes its probably better to be safe than sorry We have patients who end up taking these products because they think that theyre natural and theyre safe and theyre not going to do anything Well most cases end up in the emergency room The most important piece of information that I need to know is how old is the child and how much does he weigh I will also need to know what other medications you may have given him I would recommend Tylenol or an acetaminophen product to start for the headache I would also ask a few more questions about the sinus pressure to define it more Benadryl is OK but I would probably recommend a Claritin or Zyrtectype product because they work longer and have less side effects Yes elevated blood pressure is documented as a side effect of Prilosec Have you been taking your blood pressure at home Keep a diary of your readings and I would advise calling your doctor or health care provider for evaluation Thanks for submitting a question today This is a common question I get at the pharmacy The first thing I ask is if they have spoken with their doctor or health care provider about this and do they know you are having a hard time paying for your medications If your conditions especially the asthma are being well controlled with the medications switching to a generic or another class of medications that has a generic may not be an optimal choice If you get switched you may end up seeing the doctor more often or have more emergency room visits which in the end drives up health care costs Many of the companies have assistance programs so you may want to look at contacting Merck and AstraZeneca who manufacture the medications you are currently on My son had problems with his lymph nodes swelling and after the fear of lymphoma we found out that the cause was infection Hopefully your outcome will be something easy to fix Well i also suffer from the same problem My Dr has a belief that it is caused by Enlarged prostaet  Epididamal Cysts which restricts the flow during ejaculation and urination  In fact Im having out patient procedure to check it out and get biopsy of cysts AbsolutelyI take meds for RA which raise my BP along with BP meds which make it important to check my BP daily If it gets too high I contact my doctor to discuss other options including different types of excersise Furthermore I also check my pulse rate at the same time to be sure it does not go too high I cant respond to the medical issue but you can go to a local urgent care center to get care if youre uninsured My brother has has hypoglycemia He eats snacks throughout the day When he gets a real bad blood sugar drop he gets a migraine He can take a sugar pill glucose or an insulin injection Im 39 and have been taking adderrall dr 30 mg for more than 5 years now I take mine after breakfast in the morning I have never had issues when I exercise but every person reacts to medications differently Make sure you have food in your body and take as prescribed Your dr Or local pharmacist should be able to tell you if you are worried When you fill you script you get a print out of information about that medication and what to expect if you have allergic reaction medication interactions food interactions etc if your exercising maybe just every few minutes ou could check your heart rate If rises to fast then you know its time to rest and you will know your limits You may just need to let your body adjust to medication also for a few weeks I have been having the same issue and was told to monitor barometric pressure Ive noticed anything above 3020 begins the onset of headaches which in turn create migraines I also have a small aneurysm in one of the arteries along the brain so I have to monitor my BP and noticed that also creates headaches Sweetie I would not waste anytime at all you need to see a doctor ASAP No sweetie it is not normal and I would say that you need to go see a different dientest because apparently she doesnt know what shes talking about Strress but I would take NO CHANCES get in and have a cat scan If you take medication for high blood pressure and cholesterol there are some cold medicines you want to avoid Depending on how well your blood pressure is controlled and the rest of your medical history it may be best to avoid decongestant medications that contain phenylephrine or pseudoephedrine These can increase blood pressure and heart rate in some people who are sensitive Before taking any overthecounter cold medicine you should talk to your pharmacist who can collect more specific information about you and your medications and make the best recommendation for you Yes It would be OK to take Tussin DM for your cough while taking bupropion and a high blood pressure medication There are no significant drug interactions to worry about Always check with your pharmacist before taking overthecounter medications when you are taking prescription medications so they can recommend the best product for you that will not interact with your medications To answer your question I really would need to know more specific information about which medications you are referring to In general people with hypothyroidism and high blood pressure are advised to avoid decongestant medications that contain phenylephrine or pseudoephedrine because these medications can raise blood pressure and cause a rapid heartbeat in some patients Ask your pharmacist which cold medicine would be right for your specific symptoms and with your current medications If you have high blood pressure it is usually advised that you avoid cold medicines that contain a decongestant like pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine because they can raise the blood pressure and heart rate in some people Your pharmacist can help you choose a cold medicine that will help your symptoms and mix well with your prescription medications You should call the poison hotline any time someone takes a medication that is not intended for them The universal poison control number is 8002221222 They will be able to provide you with advice on how to handle the situation You should keep all of your prescriptions out of the reach of children and store medications for different people in the household in different areas to avoid mixups It is always important to check with your pharmacist before taking any overthecounter medications He or she knows your medical history and can provide more personalized recommendations Coricidin HBP is a line of cold medications that do not contain any decongestants like phenylephrine or pseudoephedrine which can raise blood pressure in some people It is important to understand that this line of products will not treat congestion It will only help with runny nose and cough depending on which formula you buy The ingredients in Coricidin HBP can be found in other products as well So ask your pharmacist about the most economical way to treat your cold symptoms Most antihistamines are safe to use with medications for high blood pressure But I would avoid the ones that also contain a decongestant as these may raise blood pressure I would need to know which medications you take in order to provide a more precise answer You should talk to your pharmacist before taking any overthecounter medications especially if you have high blood pressure All medications carry some risk of side effects Side effects of ToprolXL include dizziness drowsiness dry mouth nausea constipation and depression Signs of serious side effects are shortness of breath or wheezing changes in your heartbeat and swelling of the feet and hands It is safe to take ToprolXL with lisinopril There are no dangerous drug interactions Since SlimQuick is not regulated like medications are we do not have very reliable information on what is in it or how safe and effective it is As a pharmacist I generally steer my patients clear of these weightloss gimmicks I would suggest you see a nutritionist and get a personal trainer Nothing helps you lose weight better than eating less and moving more Considering your other medical conditions you should stay away from weight loss supplements that can cause unwanted side effects such as jitters rapid heartbeat and elevated blood pressure Yes as long as your doctor has determined it is safe for you to engage in sexual activity There are no significant interactions to be concerned about and there is no overdose here Many people require several medications to get their blood pressure under control  it is very common The important thing is to get his blood pressure to where it needs to be usually less than 14090 to lower his chances of having a heart attack or stroke The medications for erectile dysfunction like Viagra are safe to take with enalapril There are no drug interactions to be concerned about But you should take those medications only under the care and advice of a healthcare professional No There are no effective overthecounter diuretics If you are experiencing water retention you should see your healthcare professional for an examination Water retention could be a sign of other conditions that should be checked out by a doctor No It is unlikely to cause significant harm You may notice some dizziness due to extra low blood pressure though They should not affect the efficacy of each other There are no significant interactions reported between these two medications except that when taking Bactrim you are more likely to experience high potassium levels which is a side effect of enalapril If you are concerned about drug interactions you should talk to your doctor or pharmacist who can help you sort through your concerns The three OTC pain relievers available are acetaminophen ibuprofen and naproxen None of these interacts with amlodipine So any of them would be considered safe to use for shortterm management of pain or fever Ibuprofen and naproxen when taken chronically for pain can raise blood pressure In this case acetaminophen would be best There is more to consider in finding the right pain reliever than just the other medications you take I would suggest you talk to your pharmacist who can evaluate your entire situation and help you find the best pain reliever for your needs Zyrtec does not have any significant interactions with blood pressure medications So it should be fine to take for managing your allergies You should talk to your pharmacist who can provide a full assessment of your situation and help determine if Zyrtec is best choice for you Yes he can take ibuprofen for shortterm pain while taking lisinopril and HCTZ There are no significant interactions with this combination The only concern would be that in the first few days after surgery some doctors suggest avoiding ibuprofen because of its potential to cause bleeding But after the first day or two it is usually fine Talk to your dentist if you have concerns There are no significant interactions between these two medications Your pharmacist should check all of your medications for drug interactions when you have your prescriptions filled So as long as you have your prescriptions filled at the same pharmacy each time which I suggest you do they will be screened for dangerous interactions If you are concerned about the medications you are taking you should discuss it with your healthcare professional Medications approved by the FDA are tested and considered safe and effective for the conditions they treat All medications carry some risks of side effects and some can be quite serious But the benefits almost always outweigh the risks Coreg treats serious conditions like high blood pressure and heart failure which kills hundreds of thousands of people every year You should never stop a medication abruptly without talking to your doctor If you have concerns you should share them with your doctor who can work with you to find a medication regimen to suit your needs and ease your concerns Rapidly fluctuating blood pressure may be seen with advancing PD The pressure may elevate when a patient is in an off state and having less mobility Conversely the pressure may drop quite low during periods on better mobility  and dyskinesia Treatment of this problem is difficult but relies on a PD regimen that concentrates on medicine dosing for steady state dosing levels Discuss this strategy with your doctor  and remember to always get your blood pressure taking while sitting and standing in any doctors office If your blood pressure is elevated all the time it is not as likely to be related to PD and should be treated However it may not take as much antihypertensive medications as with someone without PD The antiPD medicines all lower blood pressure The standard answer that we have seen is No However after the experience of my wife last year we will not be getting flu shots again My wife a 50 something RN got a flu shot in our GPs office during the first session of a standard 2 session annual check up Her blood pressure was checked during that visit and it registered her typical lifelong pressure of 11070 Three days later for the completion of the annual physical she was in the same doctors office and her blood pressure was 180 First time it was ever recorded at anything over 120 It has continued to be an issue since at 130150  It sounds like youve been doing the right thing by keeping your sodium and protein intake low as recommended by the National Kidney Foundation Several health organizations recommend regular checks of proteinuria so dont rely on symptoms and get yourself checked I also recommend checking in with your nephrologist about the herbal treatments you are trying to see if they are contraindicated If you have diabetes blood sugar control is very important as well as keeping your blood pressure down There are other factors that can increase the progression of renal disease including anemia abnormal blood lipids such as cholesterol and problems with mineral metabolism A registered dietitian can help you troubleshoot your diet as a whole You can find a dietitian at eatrightorg I cannot find any evidence showing that rapid weight loss causes blood pressure to rise In general weight loss typically helps to reduce blood pressure What you need to find out is why his doctor recommended not eating bananas in the first place It may be because his potassium levels are high If so there are many other foods that are a good source of potassium he should know about So find out the reasoning and then decide what you want to do There is a well researched diet for high blood pressure called the DASH diet standing for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Here are the basics of the diet low in sodium no more than 2300mg sodium the average sodium intake in the American diet is 3500 Reading labels is key plenty of fruits and vegetables which contain potassium an important nutrient to help lower blood pressure Try including sources at every meal Some ideas include cutting fruit up ahead of time for quick meals fruit and veggie smoothies in between meals and green salads with lunches and dinners 23 servings of low fat dairy foods such as milk yogurt and low fat cheeses Nuts seeds and legumes most days of the week Healthy fat sources such as olive oil instead of butter Limited amounts

could be that the days you eat sugar you also get extra sodium causing your blood pressure to spike If you want to avoid diabetes keep your weight in check eat a healthy diet and get plenty of exercise This WebMD article provides more of the specifics on preventing diabetes from developing Not answering my own question but would like to clarify what kind of person I am I have this thing where peer pressure doesnt work on me regardless of who it is Ex Never done drugs took a sip of alcohol and that was that nasty stuff I think Im allergic to it in fact still a virgin at 20 I have no pressure when it comes to my actions if I dont want to do it I dont do it if I do then I do Im asking for help not relationship advice When blood pressure is not sufficient to deliver enough blood to the organs of the body the organs do not work properly and can be temporarily or permanently damaged For example if insufficient blood flows to the brain brain cells do not receive enough oxygen and nutrients and a person can feel lightheaded dizzy or even faint Going from a sitting or lying position to a standing position often brings out symptoms of low blood pressure This occurs because standing causes blood to settle in the veins of the lower body and this can lower the blood pressure If the blood pressure is already low standing can make the low pressure worse to the point of causing symptoms The development of lightheadedness dizziness or fainting upon standing caused by low blood pressure is called orthostatic hypotension Normal individuals are able to compensate rapidly for the low pressure created by standing with the responses discussed previously and do not develop orthostatic hypotension When there is insufficient blood pressure to deliver blood to the coronary arteries the arteries that supply blood to the hearts muscle a person may develop chest pain a symptom of angina or even a heart attack When insufficient blood is delivered to the kidneys the kidneys fail to eliminate wastes from the body for example urea BUN and creatinine and increases in their levels in the blood occur Shock is a lifethreatening condition where persistently low blood pressure causes organs such as kidneys liver heart lung and brain to fail rapidly Caffeine can increase the blood pressure but the effect usually only lasts for a short time Experts have yet to make a strong link between caffeine and long term high blood pressure That being said a lot of doctors tell patients that have high blood pressure or heart disease that they should limit their caffeine A boost even a temporary one in blood pressure may not be a good idea on top of already high blood pressure Besides coffee caffeine is found in tea energy drinks soft drinks and even in chocolate Some headachepain medicines also have caffeine in them Your daughterinlaw should let her doctor know how much coffee she drinks as well as other sources of caffeine in her day Too much caffeine is often a cause of sleep problems or can make existing sleep problems even worse Hope this helps You should seek immediate emergency help with any symptoms of upper back or chest pain Call 911 now  I do not speak professionally on this topic but I have also been seeing doctor for a yr with plantar fasciitis followed by pain on top of foot In my case there is a subchondral cyst that caused fracture of 4th metatarsal which only showed up on MRI not x rays Stick with all follow ups until you determine the cause of pain In chronic stress particularly when a person lives with longstanding uncertainty about safety or shelter or other risky situations there is a chronic overstimulation of the fightflight response and the sympathetic nervous system The most prominent hormonal effect is on adrenaline and cortisol from the adrenal glands These hormones can raise the blood sugar levels and cause chronic overstimulation of the insulinproducing beta cells of the pancreas We can measure hormone levels in the blood fairly easily and we can measure cortisol in the saliva as well In research studies we can measure brain activity using functional MRI scanning with hyperactivity of the subconsious parts of the brain involved in flightflight In animal experiments they can monitor sympathetic nervous system activity and tone This is not practical for individual patients however In chronic stress

pressure doesnt return to normal in the next couple of days have your doctor check it out It may be pressure buildup in your ears which can happen from allergies You could try an overthecounter allergy treatment  something with a decongestant if you have no heart problems and your blood pressure is fine make sure to read the label to make sure the medication is OK for you  for a few days and see if that helps If not you should check with your doctor as you dont want to ignore hearing loss My best guess would also be gas which can cause strange symptoms if the gas gets caught in an area of your intestines or colon Of course the best way to get to the bottom of it is doing exactly what youre doing The colonoscopy will tell if there is anything going on with your colon The CT scan looks at the entire abdomen so it doesnt appear there is any obvious structural problem If the colonoscopy doesnt find anything and you continue to have the problem the next step may be an endoscopy which looks at the stomach and esophagus You just have to go through a process of elimination to see if something pops up as possibly causing the sensation But the description of your symptoms doesnt bring anything else in particular to mind at this point I am not sure what your question is but your blood pressure and heart rate are normal Unless you are having symptoms of low blood pressure such as dizziness especially when standing a blood pressure of 10440 is not necessarily an issue Its more common for young women like yourself to have blood pressure that is on the low side but still normal

trachea heart valves eyes joints and connective tissue This can be a very dangerous disease that is very difficult to diagnose as only about 3 or so people out of every 1 million ever develop the disease Mayo Clinic has a good easy to understand write up about it If you suspect that this may be your problem after reading the Mayo andor other articles you would do well to contact a Rheumatologist and mention it to himher Be sure to bring up the name Relapsing Polychondritis as most doctors have never seen this disease It took me ten years to get diagnosed Have you tried looking

this effect may increase the risk of abnormal bleeding Some of these medications include aspirin ibuprofen warfarin and clopidogrel Black cohosh may reduce blood pressure so it may increase the

Society cautions that black cohosh appears to increase the effects of some chemotherapy drugs and decrease the effects of others Patients taking tamoxifen may experience increased side effects if also

height and your blood pressure Your ideal weight is derived from your ideal body mass index or BMI Your BMI is calculated as your weight in kilograms divided by your height in meters squared An ideal BMI is between 18 and 24 You can also use BMI tables to calculate your BMI Higher BMIs have been correlated with higher risk of diseases related to overweight and obesity and lower BMIs have been correlated with diseases resulting from being underweight Therefore most doctors will use BMI as a screening tool to decide whether you are a healthy weight Interestingly BMI tends to be interpreted in a genderneutral manner That is women tend to have lower BMIs than men but both are assessed on the same scale There is a good amount of variance in what doctors consider an ideal weight The reason is that when your doctor assesses your weight she compares you to data generated from a population of people who are your age gender and height Because there is inherent variation in data drawn from large populations doctors tend to consider weights normal if they are greater than the lowest 5 percent of weights recorded in that population or lesser than or equal to the highest 5 percent Do hope

it explains things a lot better than me A number of medications can be used to treat high blood pressure One commonly prescribed class of antihypertensive medication is the beta blocker class of drugs Beta blockers work by blocking the effects of adrenaline or epinephrine on blood vessels and the heart Epinephrine causes your blood vessels to constrict and makes your heart pump faster causing your blood pressure to rise By blocking this effect beta blockers help lower your blood pressure One of the dangers of taking vitamin supplements is that they can interfere with the activity of certain medications Vitamin E reduces the absorption of beta blockers such as propanolol by your intestines This makes the beta blockers less effective and can cause your blood pressure to rise If you are taking vitamin E you may need to use higher doses of beta blockers or switch to a different antihypertensive drug From live strongcom Do hope this helps you Good Luck Hi Odds its just trapped wind It

began to turn toward my other toes causing a hammer toe What number is consider dangerous high blood pressure My grandma has 18980 do we need to take her to the hospiral she is 89 years old A deep bruise on your tailbone wont show on the skin but it does hurt really badly and is uncomfortable to sit on for a while When I bruised my tailbone falling down stairs I was in pain for about a week and a half and couldnt participate in normal activities for the first two days I did see a doctor who confirmed it was just a bruise though It may have just been bruised badly but it could be safe to go to the walk in clinic for reassurance I guess I dont get why a diastolic the BOTTOM number of 7090 is considered high Normal BP USED to be 12080 I know that has changed My systolic BP used to be between 110120 but my diastolic would run 92100 so my Dr prescribed a mild diuretic hydrocholothiazide or HCTZ to control just that number As I got older my systolic TOP number crept up into the 130s and 140s so she prescribed atenelol beta blocker and now my BP runs about 11270 I am 52 years old it will not it is the other way around blood clots anywhere in the body especially in the brain and heart increases blood pressure one of the reason is that brain and heart are poor anaerobic performer meaning of all body tissue this 2 cant perform well without enough oxygen so when there is a blood clot oxygen supply decreases as well and when oxygen supply decreases some of the cells starts to deteriorate and when those cells are damaged and start to die they releases enzymes that transmit impulses to our vital sign centermedulla oblongata that they are lacking oxygen in response to those impulses it releases enzymes that tell our heart to increase its workload to increase perfusion of blood to those area affected by the blood clot but this action only worsen patients w brain blood clots because as blood pressure increase those blood clots move further till the size or diameter of blood vessel is too small where it can totally block the blood flow so it is advisable for patient w brain blood clot to have stable blood pressure most of the time Im not sure what you mean by hypertension or what method you are using to determine you have it However untreated high blood pressure is a dangerous disease with consequences that can reduce your quality of life cause serious chronic disease or kill you It has been implicated in Altzheimers disease as well If you are not diagnosed you will not be able to receive treatment You are very young and deserve to have a beautiful lifedont risk it by not taking care of yourself Severe A healthy blood pressure should never drop under 10060 I am on BP medication Beta and calcium channel blockers and my home measured BP averaged 12076 However I had a flu shot a day ago when I had my BP checked hours later averaged 1381508690 over three readings I was concerned about this IS A BP READING OF 12366 A GOOD READING FOR A 71 YEAR OLD WOMAN  I can understand that you would be concerned for your health but as you said your BP is high when you take it or when you go to either the doctors office or to the ER This indicates that its really situational but I can also understand that you would like to be able to be a bit calmer Chronic stress is what can cause medical illness but I didnt see that you indicated you are under chronic stress I would suggest however that you begin to learn some ways to help yourself remain calm I dont know if you have regular medical checkups but that would be a good start Once you know that everything is okay medically then you can begin using some selfhelp techniques Since you are still a minor I would suggest that you discuss this with your parents and that there there should be a discussion between them and your treating physician I hope that you have made your parents aware of your concern since it would be helpful to have their understanding and support There are some forms of cardiac arrhythmia  including PAT paroxysmal atrial tachycardia and supraventricular tachycardia  that can cause those symptoms they can be diagnosed by a cardiologist using a Holter monitor test and there are other conditions including high blood pressure all of which might have been brought to light by hormonal changes following your recent pregnancy The best place to start is with your primary care provider It could be that you may need to take a mild dose of a Betablocker such as Metoprolol Tartrate which I take Once your doctors have ruled out anything more serious something along those lines could be of great help If there is an endocrine imbalance your doctor might decide to send you to an endocrine specialist but because of the recent pregnancy be sure to keep your OBGYN in the loop Good Luck In the meantime be sure to sleep with your head elevated slightly and it might help a little if you dont lie on your back it puts a little more stress on your mitral valves You could be getting migraines go see your family doc if they persist Good luck I did the same thing a while back fell exactly on my tailbone hurt like heck took a few days for the bruise to come all the way in and was incredibly sore and sensitive for a few weeks maybe a month before really back to normal and I couldnt do any floor exercises for about two weeks either and mine was only bruised not broken Cancer CONGRATS ON THE BABI 1st  stop doing Zumba until you see your doctor to figure out whats going on 2nd  see your doctor or get to an emergency room asap dont mess around with your health This could be something very serious Hope everything goes well Especially if you have high blood pressure or are a diabetic you should see your endocrinologist eye doctor asap If youre not able to see them right away go to the emergency room to make sure youre ok Please dont take any chances with your health Take care Im really surprised the doctor did not give you any options at that point Especially if its causing you pain call the urologist every day a couple times each day seeing if they can get you in sooner or if there are any cancellations If not find another urologist that can help you NOW Part of being a parent is asking all the questions like these to the doctor you are seeing Its not a good thing for a patient to leave with more questions than they went in with having  time to find another doctor Always do the best you can to be prepared for doctors visits with any questions or concerns you have medications for any conditions you have that you do and do not feel comfortable taking etc Dont let them pass you around  in cases like this they can always squeeze you in somewhere Make sure you are clear to the urologists office when you call that you are in extreme pain and need to be seen that day and if they cant help you youll pay another doctor who can get you in sooner after all you are paying for their service Wish you lots of luck Take care You have hypertension and need to be on medication to control your blood pressurethat is what those numbers mean If your doctor is not taking these elevated readings or your chest discomfort seriously you need to see a cardiolgist or internist for a higherlevel evaluation You also need to see an ophthalmologist for you eye problems You will need to see an orthopedist for a thorough examination of your knee and probably an MRI of that problematic joint Since this problem has been going on for 23 years it is hightime for you to get it checked out medically The schools trainer may have just guessed and a guess is not a diagnosis Otitis media is a MIDDLE EAR INFECTION usually treated with antibiotics not drops A loud ringing could be tinnitus often caused by an INNER EAR condition not something that drops would help Coupled by this unusual painpressure in your head it would be prudent to consider a higherlevel medical evaluation from an Ear Nose and Throat ENT specialist It would not be possible to determine a cause of your head pressure blindly over the Internet Yesyou have a very high blood pressure There can be hundreds of causes of headachesunfortunately I have no way of getting additional information or examining you to make an association between your high blood pressure and your headache It is very important for you to SEE a medical professional so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated Without seeing your bumps I cannot be sure you have shingles either Shingles is typically not in the middle of the back but rather follows a nerve pathway on just ONE SIDE of the body so in your case it would only be on one side of the back perhaps traveling the front but never crossing the midline The can be a bit itching initially but shingles is notorious for being painful or burning Unfortunately without the ability to examine your foot I would have no idea if you will be able to play in your tournament a few days from now Medical providers do not like making blind decisions like this so you will need to be examined A tetanus vaccine prevents tetanus but does not prevent INFECTION Deeper wounds like you have described could become infected if not cared for properly You did the right thingyou saw a urologist for a proper examination Yes prostatitis can cause some but not all of your symptoms so please finish that course of antibiotics A person can have more than one issue going on at the same time so please keep in mind that burning on urination as well as irritated or sensitive penis tip can be a chemical sensitivity new deterrgent or dryer softener or a condition called balanitis Have you tried a topical overthecounter steroid cream Make sure to always use a condom so you will not have to worry about a sexuallytransmitted disease next time I am glad that your chlamydia and gonorrhea tests were negative but you may not be so lucky next time Drug store clinics are just fine for this type of medical issue You may have a case of and need some prescription antibioticsteroid ear drops In the meantime a solution of 50 white vinegar acetic acid and 50 water  a few body temperature drops instilled in the problematic ear a few times per day will help A cheap quick test for what Unfortunately when you have the array of medical problems that you have listed there are no cheap quick tests for anythingwhether you have insurance or not You need to be under medical care so that you can have your headache evaluated your blood pressure monitored your congestive heart failure managed and vision disorder checked These are not things you can do over the counter so it would be in your best interest to find some affordable care Cervical neck disc disease will not cause thigh pain but degenerative disc disease in your low back lumbar area could certainly do this If you have not had imaging studies of your low back this should be done As far as I know medications used for erectile dysfunction do not really help premature ejaculation This is an entirely different problem and there are no medications to fix it If you have a shortfuse so to speak then the advice from one expert was Who said that you only have to have sex once The first one may be fast but as soon as you get by a brief refractory period the second time you have sex will last much longer So instead of worrying about premature ejaculation just have sex more than once at a session Of course you will need a cooperative and understanding partner Finding the underlying reason for your premature ejaculation is going to take some research on your part and a bit of soulsearching Here is an article that I think you find helpful httpmenwebmdcomtcprematureejaculationtopicoverview Your husbands surgery may have NOTHING to do with his tinnitus or high blood pressureit may have just happened as they often do was we age Rather than search for a reason or blame see an ENT to evaluate the tinnitus the cause and cure can be VERY difficult to find and his primary care doctor to treat the high blood pressure which incidentally can be one of the hundreds of causes of tinnitus There are sooooo many different medical issues that may be involved it would be impossible to track them down over the Internet Continue to take your blood pressure on a regular basis at different times of day and in both arms One isolated reading that is elevated is not as important as having several elevated readings Your medical provider will need to see your log of these home readings so please make an appointment As far as your headache and tinnitus is concerned there can be a relationship but it will be up to a medical professional  someone who can carefully examine you and look for other causes for these symptoms  before an association is made The brain No Yes you could have a sinus infection Symptoms can vary from person to person but some of the symptoms that you mentioned in your question are often seen in sinus infection Many sinus infections are viral and will be selflimiting in a weeks or so but some can be bacterial and require medical intervention like antibiotics In order for you to be properly diagnosed and treated you will need to see a health care professional for a examination first That is really not a fever Temperatures can vary up to two degrees from morning the lowest temperature to evening the highest temperature I agree with your surgeonit is nothing to worry about And human body temperature is not affected by barometric pressure Maybe It depends on how fragile the person with high blood pressure is at the time of taking this medication Delsym contains dextromethorphan and some people may have a temporary blood pressure increase I dont know the names of the particular pills there are many different blood pressure and cholesterollowering medications but generally it would be fine to take them together Just be sure this is a question that your pharmacist or medical provider should answer since they will know what you are taking Maybe your right arm is healthier just kidding We are not equal on both sides of our body and a blood pressure test taken on one side can be very different than the other side This is why it should be taken on BOTH arms to get a better average Of course in your case the left side is a normal blood pressure and the right side said you are hypertensive It would be best to get a several dozen more readings on a home blood pressure machine at different times of the day sittingstandinglying down and in both arms Record all of those readings and report them to your medical provider Perhapshigh blood pressure and the use of methamphetamines are VERY incompatible Taking extra blood pressure medication to help combat the increased blood pressure response is foolish Taking meth is foolish Many people take more than one different blood pressure medication in order to achieve control These two medications work in different ways so they can be used together Felodipine is a calcium channel blocker httpwwwmedicinenetcomfelodipinearticlehtm If your medical provider has prescribed penicillin for a bacterial infection then yes If YOU are selfprescribing penicillin for your cold then be advised that colds are viruses and penicillin does not work for viruses When you have high blood pressure certain cold medications should not be taken so please consult your medical provider or pharmacist for advise  someone who knows the exact medications you are taking or plan on taking I do not have this information nor do I know your medical history That really depends on the type of blood pressure medication For instance if you took a diuretic at bed time you would be peeing all night Some blood pressure medications can make you sleepy so bedtime would be best Since I dont know what you are taking I would advise you to ask your medical provider or pharmacist for advice An ear infection will not cause your throat to be red but it can cause lymph nodes to swell An irritated throat can cause lymph nodes to swell The commonality of both ear pain and a red throat at the same time could be a virus or bacteria Since your doctor may not know this answer even after an exam many will just put you on an antibiotic Some will rely on the results of a Strep screen to make that determination Your dizziness may be related to your ear pressureinfection See a urologist You are having symptoms suggestive of prostatitis an infection or inflammation in the prostate gland I am not sure if there is a relationship with your boweldiarrhea and fatigue issues so this could easily be an entirely separate medical problem Thats a normal blood pressure for ANY man This should answer your question httpwwwwebmdcomhypertensionhighbloodpressureguidegrapefruitjuiceandmedication I dont know anything about your father but that is a good blood pressure reading Blood pressure readings do fluctuate so some additional readings could be higher but at that reading he has a long way to go before it would be considered high To my knowledge no one has invented an internal blood pressure monitor nor do I think there would be a use for something this invasive Do you want to invent one There are plenty of telemetry devices that will take your blood pressure automatically at prescheduled times This is commonly done in hospitals like intensive care units To put an internal device you like a pacemaker or defibrillator would seem to be more risky than just taking the blood pressure when you need it Your head wont explode if that is your concern but the increased vascular pressure may not be very comfortable for you If it hurtsdont do it A suggestion Decrease your max weight and increase your repetitions at a lower weight In other words lower the intensity of your workout at least for powerlifting until you feel better The tibia is a weightbearing bone and it takes quite an impact to break it however a person can have an occult or stress fracture of this bone If this has not improved in a week it would be wise to consider a handson examination and an xray In stress fractures the xray may be negative so your medical provider may need to get a bone scan if you continue to be symptomatic How long you may be suffering from the effects of acoustic trauma is really unknown Recovery time is an individual experience but most people do improve over timein a week or two but a few hopefully not you have permanent damage to the inner ear and may experience these symptoms for a long long time NEVER shoot without GOOD ear protection Tetanus vaccines are 100 protective against tetanus for TEN YEARS The injection does not protect you against any other wound infection  just tetanus  so good first aid after any injury is always necessary There are much better antiseptics than after shave lotion alcohol so perhaps you should improve your home firstaid kit You can always get wound infections Significant errors Probably not but the standard of care for taking a blood pressure indicates that the stethoscope have skintoskin contact It is possible to hear an accurate blood pressure through a thin shirt but never a sweater or sweat shirt I have this same issue with listening to the heart or lungs through the shirtthere is really no excuse for not using proper examination technique to hear more accurate ausculation sounds Start with a gastroenterologist In many cases this can be fixed with a combination of medications and even surgery Yesthere are no medical contraindications for vitamin E even at those higher doses when you have hypertension Vitamin E is very heart friendly Your blood pressure is not in control as you know Taking your blood pressure readings every day at least twice would provider your doctor with helpful information since it appears that you will need an adjustment in your medication regime Adjusting medications is very common so this is done in most people In addition to taking your blood pressures at home make sure to reduce your salt intake and if you are overweight try to reduce your weight By achieving an ideal weight and walking more exercise this will greatly improve the effectiveness of your blood pressure management Assuming you are talking about a MIDDLE ear infection you should have experienced relief in three daysIF a you were properly and accurately diagnosed b your ear infection was due to a bacteria and not a virus and c the antibiotic you are taking was the proper choice and dosage Failure to respond to your treatment is a reason to call your medical provider for patientspecific advice Since you are still having dizziness and head pressure it would be wise to be reexamined There are no allopathic medications for hypertension available over the counter You will need to see your medical provider If cost is a consideration make sure to mention this to the provider so that lessexpensive prescription medications can be used No red hot ears is not usually a problem with your blood pressure but it is vascular In most cases this unusual phenomenon is just a variation of blushing  warm red blood is shunted to your outer ears giving them that red appearance Unlike other blushing this is not necessarily caused by embarrassment or other triggers it just happens For some people the ears can uncomfortably hot or even painful To the very least it can be embarrassing There is very little that you can do for this but since you mentioned blood pressure the use of a class of drugs called betablockers has been used for red hot ears These are use for highblood pressure preventing migraines and other cardiac problems Sometimes it helps sometimes it doesnt It would be up to you to convince your doctor to prescribe them for this purpose Red hot ears are harmless but if you consider the problem severe betablockers may be worth a try There are many discussions about red hot ears on WebMDs Ear Nose and Throat Community Board There is really not much that I can blindly do in the way of diagnosis or treatment from this end of the Internet so it is time for you to see a good ENT specialist Ask your doctor for a referral so you can have a higherlevel evaluation Some people dosome people do not Menieres is not directly related to blood pressure it is an INNER EAR DISORDER Yesyou need to see an ophthalmologist for a thorough systemic eye examination You will need to find a free clinic someone that can help take care of your blood pressure or you will need to pay for office visits Some practices have sliding scales and will charge you less or negotiate with your current medical provider to see if he would consider charging you less so you can keep seeing him I do not know what kind of blood pressure medication you are taking or if this medication requires periodic monitoring or adjustments or even routine lab work so please discuss your situation with your doctor the one who gave you the refills and ask for advice in this matter Not really Xanax is an antianxiety agent With that said if part of the reason your blood pressure is elevated is because of anxiety then it could help a bit but the reasons for elevated blood pressure are much more complex than just emotions Xanax can be use as part of the treatment but not as a sole treatment High blood pressure is almost always treatable with the right combination of medications individually prescribed and life style modifications diet and exercise This person should be under the care of a good clinician and be monitoring his own blood pressures at home keeping a log A person would only be considered untreatable if there was complete failure of medications unlikely and failure to comply with lifestyle modifications often happens and compliance It would not be prudent to increase your dosage of ANY blood pressure medication without the expressed okay from your medical provider Not all blood pressure medications are the same as you know and I dont know what you are taking There also can be hundreds of reasons for headaches and various types so dont be so sure that your headaches are related A BP of 16595 is still too high and it puts you at risk While some people can tolerate higher pressures than others that does not make it acceptable It is definitely better than 200140 though Lowering blood pressure can be done many ways using many different types of medications and combinations The goal for any clinician would be to use the least amount of medication with little or no adverse effects to control the pressure into NORMAL range It would be great to have the top number your systolic pressure below 138 and that bottom number the diastolic pressure below 88 Yes some BP meds can make you tiredsleepy or even contribute to your cold handsfeet so try to work with your doctor until you can find the right combination Hopefully you have a blood pressure machine at home and are taking your own BPs on a regular basis You have a good blood pressure He needs to SEE a medical provider This important step is really the ONLY way that he can be properly examined diagnosed and treated  three things that cannot be accomplished online Extreme discomfort is a highlymotivating symptoms so perhaps he can now be convinced to do the right thing and not make excuses Having his girlfriend post a question online is not a substitute for proper medical care He has a ethical and legal responsibility to refill your medications until your medical visitor give you a sooner appointment Should you have a spike in your blood pressure that results in a stroke or heart attack he will be held responsible Remind the receptionist of this Send the doctor a FAX so he will read your concerns first hand Do NOT wean off of your meds He he still will not refill themgo to an Urgent Care facility bring your bottles and ask for an emergency refillthen shop around for a more compassionate doctor to manage your high blood pressure No prescription antibiotic eye drops will not cause a change in blood pressure Many things can elevate the blood pressure however so if your readings are higher you will need to see your medical provider A change in BP meds or and adjustment in dosage is sometimes necessary I am not familiar with your other two medications  Nevanac or Durezol  so it would be best to check with the medical provider who prescribed them or your pharmacist Most topical eye medications are not going to cause systemic effects such as raising your blood pressure NSAIDs are considered to be safe if you have hypertension but I have no idea if they are safe for YOU since I do not know the details of your medical history or the type of blood pressure medications you on My advise is for you to get a patientspecific answer from your medical provider  the one treating your high blood pressure I do not know anything about your mother or her medical history but I would be concerned as well I cannot imagine that six days into a potent antibiotic course that she would be having UTI symptoms The vact that her BP is low her heart rate is high and she is having difficulty breathing would not likely be related to the UTI She needs to see her regular medical provider as soon as possible for an examination Having high blood pressure should not be a contraindication for routine dental cleaning so you would really have to ask your dentist for hisher rationale If you do have high blood pressure and it is not being effectively controlled you should definitely see your medical provider Your wife is correct That is a very high blood pressure and needs to be treated Only a fool would refuse so dont be a fool Have your medical provider order a moresensitive at this pointand make an appointment for an examination Yesmany people will be able to stop blood pressure medications if they make significant lifestyle changeslosing weight if they are overweightcontrolling stress if they are stressedexercising if they are couch potatoesreducing salt intake if they are saltaholics etc Long before antibiotics there were mothers and grandmothers Putting heat on an earache was a standard of home care in this era When you put heat on an ear or put warm oil in the ear canal another home treatment when a child has a middle ear infection it can cause the eardrum to rupture This will cause fluid pus to drain out of the ear and the reduced pressure will relieve the pain Then of course you now have a draining ruptured eardrum to deal with A ruptured eardrum may be Natures Way of curing an ear infection but it is probably not the most ideal situation Some ruptured eardrums take weeks or months to heal depending on their size and location but they do eventually heal in the vast majority of cases So its okay to use the heat but this process may cause an eardrum rupture It is time for you to see an ENT specialistthere are more things in the ear that can cause pressure symptoms other than the few things that can be seen on a routine exam You cannot diagnose these things easily and certainly not over the Internet so you need an expert Heaing loss for six monthsand pressurecould be many things from middle ear  Eustachian tube problems and TMJ disorders to the more difficulttodiagnose inner ear disorders And the fact that the the right side of your face is numb is very troubling This alone adds to the complexity of the causes It is normal for blood pressure to change nearly every time you take it regardless of the time of day The most important reading would then be the AVERAGE reading so just take your BP a few times a day and write it down As long as your average blood pressures are in the normal range minor daily fluctuations are usually not that important I cant see your eye but this may be a common subconjunctival hemorrhage  This can be caused by coughing sneezing exercising or even straining for a bowel movement Having uncontrolled high blood pressure and certain medications can be other factors but in most cases this condition is innocent  looks worse than it actually is If you are concerned you can see your medical provider or even eye care professional for a exam and consultation As much as I would like to help you it is not possible to blindly make a diagnosis over the Interneta medical provider would need to see and feel this lump in order to make an accurate determination And without a accurate diagnosis it would not be possible to suggest treatments A few suggestions First stop messing with it This could be a deep cyst sebaceous cyst or cystic acne By squeezing it you may make it worse or cause an infection Second either see your primary care medical provider or a dermatologist so that you can have an accurate diagnosis I cant imagine this lesion cannot be treated but you need that allimportant diagnosis first No it does not There are no rules in medicine that state a person can only have one medical issue at a time so you can have both but they are not related You should see your primary care medical provider An emergency room is really not the best place for the ongoing management of hypertension high blood pressure Buy your own blood pressure cuff and start taking readings at home write the down and give them to your medical provider to review HCTZ is a diuetic that can lower your blood pressure It should not decrease your stamina but it could be related to your lightheadedness with standing quickly orthostatic hypotension I would suggest that you see your medical provider  the only that prescribed the HCTZ  for a consultation No Masturbation is safe even if you have high blood pressure Get your own blood pressure machine either a manual one or a hightech electronic one Take your OWN blood pressure and keep a careful log Randomly high blood pressures due to anxiety we call it white coat hypertension tends to be discounted if all of your home blood pressures are normal Nothe rate of fingernail growth will not changeaccelerate if the other nail is removed As a matter of fact the old nail can help protect the very sensitive nail bed as the new nail gradually grows out again Yes Bactrim should be compatible with any blood pressure medication of course you forgot to mention what you are taking When it doubt your friendly neighborhood pharmacist is the best source of this information Nogive them your right arm to take the blood pressure reading Yes but so can about a hundred other things so it would be wise to seek a medical evaluation looking for other causes as well Not necessarilyyour medicines have successfully CONTROLLED your blood pressure to the point that it is now normal If you stop those medications it is likely to increase again Only your medical provider should consider decreasing your dosage I dont know what you are taking but this should be done with great care and careful monitoring Unless you have had some drastic lifestyle changes lost weight started exercising and eating better you most likely still need the therapeutic benefits of blood pressure medications There is no way for a medical provider to blindly answer that question without an examination I am sorry I would suggest that you call your medical provider  someone who knows you and your particular case  for advise in this matter Anal fissures are tiny tears or cracksthey do not typically have bubbles so I would be concerned about a cyst or abscess forming Noit is not likely that fibroid would have any adverse effects on the blood pressure If your tinnitus is related to your VNG test it should resolve in a few days to a week As you may know tinnitus is common in many inner ear disorders like Menieres It could be just be a coincidence that you have tinnitus today but then again it could have some unknown association People getting a VNG certainly can having dizziness or even nauseavomiting but tinnitus would not be a common test sideeffect No this common antibiotic similar to tetracycline will have no effect on your blood pressure Not really Excedrin has aspirin and lowdose aspirin is recommended as an adjunct for older folks who may be at risk for cardiovascular disease or heart attack The aspirin part is good Excedrin some forms have caffeine and caffeine can actually raise blood pressure temporarily in someone who is sensitive Any reaction would depend on the type blood pressure pill and the dosage both of which you did not disclose Most of the time nothing bad will happen or you blood pressure may go down a little lower than intended Give your pharmacist a callsomeone who knows your dosage and the type of pill that you doubledup on The pharmacist will be able to quickly provide some exact information Or you can call your medical providers office  the one who prescribed the blood pressure pills to you You bet that is good Very good as long your systolic pressure is not consistently above 140 and your diastolic pressure remains in the mid80 range An occasional elevated systolic during stress or activity is expected Blood pressures vary throughout the day so take your BP at different times different arms and in different positions once in a while sitting standing or supine and notice how they tend to change a bit Unfortunately a description  no matter how thorough  is never the same as having a direct examination fo this area in question As much as I would like to help you it would not be possible to blindling make any type of determination The ONLY way that you can get a patientspecific answer is for you to be examined It means that you have an elevated diastolic blood pressure that may need treatment should it persist It is important to get several BP readingsdifferent times of the daydifferent arms Write them down and give the list to your medical professional Many pharmacies have machines that will take your blood pressure or the pharmacist will do it for you Most decaffeinated tea would be fine with blood pressure medication Get a home blood pressure kit and monitor it and you will see that you are unlikely to have any adverse effects Nothese are not diuretics but there are combination medications brand names that may have a diuretic You can look up these medications individually on the Internet or address this question with your pharmacist Infections are known to cause blood pressure changes so it would be possible that a severe sinus infection could do the same Those readings and numbers indicates that your husbands blood pressure is too HIGH He will need to get some additional readings at different times of the day and may need to be placed on blood pressure medications and well as having a good examination In addition his medical provider may recommend that he reduce his slat intake and lose weight if he is overweight Make sure that he follows up soon with his medical provider Men can be stubborn so make sure that he goes You should be pleased that you have a heartbeat at all What a fool you are by taking this odd and dangerous combination of medications and chemicals There is really no way to know if or when your body will recover from this selfinflicted insult It depends on what you have been doing prior to these incidents There are numerous causes but one that I experience daily is after an intense workout especially a whole body workout The adrenalin and nitric oxide produced gives what some people term runners high and it usually lasts 30  40 minutes after a workout  depending on the intensity You should be just fine with moderate exercise and proper warmup and stretching beforehand Keep yourself wellhydrated throughout the day exercising or not Dont try anything extra strenuous without talking to your doctor first And remember not to get overheated I take 20mg adderall each day and am following a mildtomoderate exercise regime as suggested by my doctor I always stay wellhydrated and I slow down when I feel as though I am getting overheated premenopausal Good luck PS Im a nurse too Yes Very simply put your heart is on the left side of your body so that would make pressure readings different from side to side Absolutely Known this from experience I HAD THAT TOO ENDED UP HAVING A HYSTERECTOMY NEVER FELT BETTER Resistant hypertension RHTN is defined as high blood pressure BP that requires 4 or more medications for treatment I suffered from extreme anemia as well You may want to talk to her doctor about the iron infusions Those really are of more help than the actual iron supplement I would go to the Dr ASAP especially if these syptoms have been prolonged there are many things that can cause these symptoms but only a Good Dr can diagnose Discomfort with what Groin or Hip different things You might want to go to a different doctor and get a different blood test Be honest with the doctor about all activities If you want to find out what is going on you must be honest Doctors are not gods they need information Have the doctor check for everything

one thing groin another think about it Do you know how thin your blood is I am NOT very knowledgeable in BP but if you are standing and sitting logically because blood is affected by gravity if you are on too much HBP meds thins blood your body might have an issue keeping it out of your legs which would also explain why sleeping helps it but again not my area of knowledge just an opinion I am 58 years old and got the flu shot yesterday as it was offered at my place of employment I had never received the flu vaccine before My normal blood pressure is 11360 Less than an hour after the vaccine I was lightheaded could not walk without assistance and my blood pressure read 160100 I was taken to the emergency room and stayed for two hours until my blood pressure returned to a more normal state The doctor said it was an adverse reaction to the flu vaccination and told me never to get it again WHAT IA A NORMAL BLOOD PRESSURE READING I would see a Dr if I were having hematuria andor pain Ah this might be a simple case of footupyourownarse If it has been there for a week it is logical it is only one side you have to forcefully pull it out and then have a refreshing shower after that you should be able to walk normally without being considered a biological weapon R sometimes the medicine works too good and you may hale to have the script at a lower dose I fainted on mine My blood pressure improved and ending up being too low I went from 326124 to 9959 I was taken off bp meds all together My pressure is now stabilized Will keep an eye on it for the next couple of months Go ASAP I would seek the consultation of a nephrologist kidney specialist  so that your progression can be followed and relevant information can be given to you regarding your diet and possible lifestyle changes that may benefit you  andor halt the progression of any kidney disease  I know according to what I have read that when the eGFR drops below 60  it is an indication of Chronic Kidney disease starting  or possibly acute kidney disease if the GFR fell suddenly in response to an injury If you have had a pupil that has remained dilated for 6 months you should call your eye doctor and have him or her take a look Only a oneonone exam can accurately determine if this is something natural for you or if there is a health issue that you need to be concerned about The WebMD Answers Staff Welcome to WebMD Answers If your blood pressure is spiking please contact your doctor and let him or her know whats going on Here is some information on that may help you know what to ask I hope you find out whats going on soon WebMD Answers Staff A blood pressure reading appears as two numbers The first and higher of the two is a measure of systolic pressure or the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats and fills them with blood The second number measures diastolic pressure or the pressure in the arteries when the heart rests between beats Normal blood pressure rises steadily from about 9060 at birth to about 12080 in a healthy adult If someone were to take your blood pressure immediately after youd delivered a speech or jogged five miles the reading would undoubtedly seem high This is not necessarily cause for alarm Its natural for blood pressure to rise and fall with changes in activity or emotional state Its also normal for blood pressure to vary from person to person even from one area of your body to another But when blood pressure remains consistently high talk with your doctor about treatment Consistently high blood pressure forces the heart to work far beyond its capacity Along with injuring blood vessels hypertension can damage the brain eyes and kidneys People with blood pressure readings of 14090 or higher taken on at least two occasions are said to have high blood pressure If the pressure remains high your doctor will probably begin treatment People with blood pressure readings of 200120 or higher need treatment immediately People with diabetes are treated if their blood pressure rises above 13080 since they already have a high risk of heart disease Researchers identified people with blood pressures slightly higher than 12080 as a category at high risk for developing hypertension This condition is called prehypertension and affects an estimated 50 million American men and women Prehypertension is now known to increase the likelihood of damage to arteries and the heart brain and kidneys so many doctors are now recommending early treatment though there is no evidence that this helps in the long run Essential Hypertension In as many as 95 of reported high blood pressure cases in the US the underlying cause cannot be determined This type of high blood pressure is called essential hypertension Though essential hypertension remains somewhat mysterious it has been linked to certain risk factors High blood pressure tends to run in families and is more likely to affect men than women Age and race also play a role In the US blacks are twice as likely as whites to have high blood pressure although the gap begins to narrow around age 44 After age 65 black women have the highest incidence of high blood pressure Essential hypertension is also greatly influenced by diet and lifestyle The link between salt and high blood pressure is especially compelling People living on the northern islands of Japan eat more salt per capita than anyone else in the world and have the highest incidence of essential hypertension By contrast people who add no salt to their food show virtually no traces of essential hypertension Many people with high blood pressure are salt sensitive meaning that anything more than the minimal bodily need for salt is too much for them and increases their blood pressure Other factors that have been associated with essential hypertension include obesity diabetes stress insufficient intake of potassium calcium and magnesium lack of physical activity and chronic alcohol consumption Secondary Hypertension When a direct cause for high blood pressure can be identified the condition is described as secondary hypertension Among the known causes of secondary hypertension kidney disease ranks highest Hypertension can also be triggered by tumors or other abnormalities that cause the adrenal glands small glands that sit atop the kidneys to secrete excess amounts of the hormones that elevate blood pressure Birth control pills  specifically those containing estrogen  and pregnancy can boost blood pressure as can medications that constrict blood vessels Hypotension is the medical term for low blood pressure less than 9060 A blood pressure reading appears as two numbers The first and higher of the two is a measure of systolic pressure or the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats and fills them with blood The second number measures diastolic pressure or the pressure in the arteries when the heart rests between beats Optimal blood pressure is less than 12080 systolicdiastolic In healthy people low blood pressure without any symptoms is not usually a concern and does not need to be treated But low blood pressure can be a sign of an underlying problem  especially in the elderly  where it may cause inadequate blood flow to the heart brain and other vital organs Chronic low blood pressure with no symptoms is almost never serious But health problems can occur when blood pressure drops suddenly and the brain is deprived of an adequate blood supply This can lead to dizziness or lightheadedness Sudden drops in blood pressure most commonly occur in someone whos rising from a prone or sitting position to standing This kind of low blood pressure is known as postural hypotension or orthostatic hypotension Another type of low blood pressure can occur when someone stands for a long period of time This is called neurally mediated hypotension Postural hypotension is considered a failure of the cardiovascular system or nervous system to react appropriately to sudden changes Normally when you stand up some blood pools in your lower extremities Uncorrected this would cause your blood pressure to fall But your body normally compensates by sending messages to your heart to beat faster and to your blood vessels to constrict This offsets the drop in blood pressure If this does not happen or happens too slowly postural hypotension results The risk of both low and high blood pressure normally increases with age due in part to normal changes during aging In addition blood flow to the heart muscle and the brain declines with age often as a result of plaque buildup in blood vessels An estimated 10 to 20 of people over age 65 have postural hypotension To prevent high blood pressure first consider your diet A healthy diet can go a long way toward preventing high blood pressure Trying following the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension eating plan also known as the DASH diet which emphasizes plenty of fruits and vegetables and lowfat or nonfat dairy products Studies conducted by the National Institutes of Health have shown that the DASH diet can dramatically lower blood pressure And the results show up fast  often within two weeks At the same time cut down on salt sodium chloride which can raise blood pressure The National High Blood Pressure Education Program recommends no more than 2300 milligrams of sodium a day The ideal is even lower  only 1500 For the average man who consumes about 4200 milligrams a day that requires a big change But studies show that the lower your salt intake the lower your blood pressure Along with a healthier diet it is smart to be as active as possible to prevent high blood pressure In 2007 researchers at the University of Minnesota published results from a study of almost 4000 people between the ages of 15 and 30 who were followed over time The more active they were the lower their risk of developing hypertension A few other changes can also keep your blood pressure in check Both excessive alcohol consumption and smoking can raise blood pressure Men who drink alcohol should stick to no more than two standard drinks a day And if you smoke the advice is obvious Get serious about quitting Hypertension is high blood pressure Blood pressure is the force of blood against the walls of arteries High blood pressure is dangerous because it makes the heart work harder to pump blood to the body and it is linked to clogging of the arteries Should be checked out for abnormalities by MRI Make sure that he dosent go to sleep permaturely I also have Sleep Apnea and I am on AntiDepressants I have

to make sure They are correct it more than likely is a cyst I would make a doctors appointment to have it checked out  When working you tend to aggravate it causing it to swell and fill with fluid  You most likely have pinkeye I had the same symptoms You should go to a doctor and get it checked out as soon as possible I would a see a doctor asap I have migraines but have not experienced this However I have heard about this from other people Im wondering if youre confusing blood pressure reading with heart rate Your numbers sound normal to me recently retired ER nurse of 28 years blood pressure would go up when youre active Your blood pressure reading would be two numbers 10070 your heart rate would be the count of your heart beats for one minute 100 yes pain can def cause a rise in blood pressure I was told by my RA docs nurse that the more pain will cause more stress that leads to a higher blood pressure I just know a clot slows or even blocks blood flow so yes I am SO sorrybut I could not resist saying this I have NO idea how old you are or anything else about you of courseBUT your spelling is just really bad I just wondered why I guess And I wish I could help you with it Warm wishes Marty lilpond I have had bouts with chronic hiccups my entire life until I found a permanent overthecounter medicine that cured them for me and keep me from ever getting them anymore and I am in my mid40s I dont know I would call your doctors office and tell them whats going on and let them decide What causes high Systolic 160s and Low Dyastolic 65s  I am 76 Yrsold a Male it sounds like an ovarian cyst that ruptured It happens everytime a women ovulates and it can cause your side to hurt as well In some cases it could be pcos But most likely not Hope this helps its ok as long as you dont put salt on it  i have sex problem how to treat Look into an antifungal cream from a drug store If you did not bruise your foot then you dont have a bruise I had this on my back and found that it

something you are not ready for If you arent comfortable talking about it with him you arent ready to have intercourse with him He is buying condoms but  doesnt want to pressure you Take a big step back and reevaluate this relationship That pressure is not bad even though the systolic top number is a little elevated If I had a patient with that pressure I would not be alarmed I am a nurse But since hypertension runs in your family if I were you I would keep track of your pressure and if it goes higher go get checked out by your doctor you could be prehypertensive Also losing weight may help bring your pressure down a little Well first of all your pulse at 87 is just fine Your systolic pressure of 123 is also excellent but the diastolic bottom number concerns me a little Your diastolic pressure is your heart at rest and should be lower than 96 Sometimes your pressure can be different readings at different times of the day and in different circumstances for instance did you run or smoke or even eat before your pressure was taken You should get an orthostatic BP reading which includes readings while sitting standing and lying down and see if it improves Stage 3 kidney disease is not good More than likely associated with your diabetes You are more than likely over weight Stay on a diabetic diet See your Dr so you can keep track of your A1c and Blood pressure Also

share your problems and also get help Generic Viagra aka Sildenafil Comes in three different doses 25mg 50mg and 100mg You are taking the maximum recommended And with some facial flushing I would not recommend increasing your dosage Take it about 1 hour before any sexual activity There are other side effects if you go over the recommended dosage Like light headed and being dizzy etcetc If you are going to think about going over 100mg Be sure and ask your Dr that give it to you first When I was Pregnant my doctor told me no so I dont recommend it They told me to take Robetession DM or Tylenol Cold There is at least one clinical trial that showed LArginine to be an effective ED treatment The studied dose was 5000 mgday for 6 weeks About twothirds of the patients showed improvement You might want to try that before an implant Possibly a plantar wart They are tender and painful Check with your doctor try doing a bicycle like leg exercise before you get out of bed in the moring i have high blood pressure when it is up i feel tired i get mad easy i think in some people it does cause mood changes coffee or soda can cause the flutter to much caffeine will cause this I lay on the edge of

Drtold her this was a good reading I think she is going to a quack She does have heart problems its a heart murmur The technical name is orthostatic hypotension You had a good answer already I am merely trying to contribute No a doctor should not put you on any medication without see you cause it could be harmful or make matters worse My 88 year old Mother has had CLL for 2023 years Now the

number is the pressure on your heart between beats I was on bp meds because my bottom number got so high yea sound like you have a yeast infection id go get checked out girl Forgot to mention I have always had bad anxiety and stress if this plays a factor in anything I saw a video clip from dr Oz show last night It says for dry cough to use an suppresantdextromethrophan and for a wet cough to use expectorant guaifenesin This could be a sign of cluster headaches if there on the left side of ur head and the pain is so excruciating that u want to smash ur head off the wall and u think ur eye ball

there are certain food you should avoid and other you should eat to help lower the blood pressure if you sweating profusely with muscle cramp dizziness and either shallow or trouble breathing yes it

history Have you talked to a doctor at all It could be a small fracture If it were a sprain the pain would have been much worse at the beginning Is it swollen at all Take Tylanol for the pain and if there is any swelling it should help with that as well RICE is a great aid for this type of injury but if the pain keeps up you may need an xray or an MRI I think you should follow the doctors advice do not take concerta DO not know by the way i got tested for arthritis and they said i didnt have it Your husband should be tested for sleep apnea right away He is probably sleep deprived and his heart health is at risk Does he snore and like snort and wake himself up Thats because he has stopped breathing There are many reasons for sleep apnea Also if he has a cold or sinus congestion or

myself off of the medicine and cut the pill in half and take half for a week The next week I would take half of a half then take half of a half every other day for a week The fourth week I would discontinue altogether I would tell my doctor if or when I had a visit I think wthis drug you could probably just stop taking it all together but of course I am not a doctor Its not like a blood pressure medicine though I had horrible side effects TTP bruising platelets dramatically dropped muscles hurt brain fog tired from this drug I will never take a statin again I believe there are other

good luck  Some people do experience vertigo and lightheadedness when taking BP meds It happens a lot when going from laying to standing or sitting to standing I recommend getting in these positions slowly and standing still for a few seconds before walking These symptoms can also mean that your BP is dropping too low If it continues and happens at other times besides just changing positions call your doctor Your meds may need to be lowered a bit or switched to something else Yes go to the doctor A UTI is an infection and can spread to other parts of the body If this happens it can take longer and be harder to treat It means as far as blood pressure and heart rate you are in a normal range Thats a good thing It means you dont have high blood pressure 109 is a bit high for heart rate but nothing to be concerned about 90 in in normal range Some people just naturally have heart rate the are on the higher side Or it could mean that when you had your heart rate taken you had just climbed some stairs rushed to you appt or were a bit anxious Personally since you are only in the pre hypertension stage I would say start with the cardiologist recommendation You can always go on the pills if it doesnt work Also do you check your blood pressure at any other time besides at the doctor Many peoples BPs go up naturally just beacuse they are at the doctor Its called white coat syndrome Go to your local pharmacy that has a blood pressure machine and check it there Make sure you sit there at least 4 minutes before taking your pressure walking can raise it so you need to rest first Great Job on the weight loss That is awesome It is possible that you may be able to eventually reduce or get off your BP meds but it depends on various factors If weight is a contributing factor for the High BPs then losing weight should help Bring it up with your doctor and make shehe knows that reducing meds is something youd like to work on If you dont have one already get an electronic blood pressure machine This way you can record your BP numbers and have something to show the doctor when you go to your appt and he will have a guide to use to help start reducing your meds The signs youve described can also be caused by hypo or hyper glycemia Have a doctor do some simple blood tests to make sure he doesnt have diabetes This is normal Blood pressure is usually higher when standing up as complared to lying down or even sitting The body works harder when standing so the blood pressure is slightly more elevated As for your numbers your BPs are still running too high If these are your average numbers while on medication I suggest you talk to your doctor about it Good Luck Blood pressure will be high after excersising Moving around will cause the BP to go up which is why they always have you sit when you are at the doctors office Even just standing can raise your BP I would let your doctor know this at your next visit though as I am not sure if it should be going that high Good Luck It definitely depends on your approach to weight loss What foods did you eat and did you exercise also Exercise which increases the heart rate for about 20 min a few times a week will help to reduce cholesterol glucose and bp Also if youve been eating processed foods ie WeightWatchers prepared meals you might want to check the sodium content nitrates and other chemicals all known for that ominous jump in blood pressure we all dread Id be willing to bet that the meals especially without exercise as with any other change in diet only to lose weight are at least playing a part in the blood pressure increases especially since this is a common complaint among dieters My suggestion would be to stop dieting and to make small HEALTHY lifestyle changes such as eating more fruits and veggies especially fresh lots of green leafy foods  fresh spinach is excellent Make sure that you cut back on processed foods simple carbohydrates donuts cake candy as these just feed any sugar addiction you may have very bad for you eat high protein foods healthy fats omega3 from avocados olive and coconut oils Also eat small healthy snacks between meals and drink lots of water This will keep you from overeating at meal time keeps your metabolism going which helps to burn more fat and helps you to lose weight fat cells the right way lowering risk of any negative side effects which come with many dietsfads I was diagnosed with Type II Diabetes about 6 12 years ago and these are the things which I had to learn to get rid of the excess fat I had put on after ending up physically disabled for many years and less active They work my A1C is down to normal levels and I do not take the meds any longer I know it works and any exercise you can add to your food regimen will help you too I wish you great success and hope that this helps Hi Im assuming that youre asking if its normal for a doctor to put you on the meds for hbp if hes not seen you before so thats what I will attempt to address here First it is good that youre asking this question Many these days just take whatever theyre prescribing and I believe are alltootrusting of the medical community So good for you To begin with it would depend upon what medical records the physician is reviewing from your previous physician Does he have a few years at least right in front of him Has he spoken with you regarding your recent history as far as those numbers are concerned or just coming in and looking at your chartstats from your triage upon arrival that day The reason I ask is this unfortunately I have had the very same thing happen to me While I cannot advise you to do what I did as I am not a physician but just a fairly frequently ill person whos had a lot of experience involving many areas of medicine I will tell you that this physician did NOT have previous records and did NOT ask me if I had a history of hbp but rather just TOLD me that based on the ONE Reading from that appointment I did have hbp and prescribed meds That was not in my humble opinion the proper way to arrive at a diagnosis which was firm enough to warrant the prescribing of medication Needless to say I did not take it I do not have hbp  as a matter of fact I was diagnosed years ago with Orthostatic Hypotension and have always had a bp that hovered right around 11076 I am a victim of white coat syndrome as some call it which is a state of TEMPORARY hbp which occurs often at even the thought of but definitely during medical tests such as blood work MRI or even just having your pressure checked Ive been that way for years I know its fairly common also as I asked the same question you have asked when I saw this doctor As a matter of fact since Ive seen one doctor or another much more frequently than the average person I have fibromyalgia and many spinalneuropathic issues and Diabetes Type II to name a few I have actually been told I have hbp by several different practitioners that I need to change my diet etc during triage for sick appointments with my PA or the ER staff when all they have is that one reading from when I was sick miserable and in pain Not a normal reading DUH Also this has still occurred after changing my diet and adding more appropriate for my disabilites exercises and losing quite a bit of weight which I gained over a brief period after relocating to the state my aging parents had moved to I was not able to get out and walk in addition to my moms great home cooking being around me all the time I dont want this to seem like a doc bashing session because I have a great deal of respect and appreciation for the majority of those whove invested their time money and energy into earning that license and I believe that many of them have their hearts in the right places However there are still some who think that we all fit into some little box a textbook examplemold and will try to cram us into one or the other and not look for an outofthebox explanation for what ails us Then there are the ones who feel that any woman with complaintsquestions is just hysterical and doesnt know whats good for her needing them to fix it with a little pill Add that to the constant pressure from big Pharma on physicians to prescribe their little  pills and on the consumer to ask for them and youve got a pretty precarious situation If youre not vigilant I believe the continuing trend towards counting on a pill to fix everything can be your doingin Like I said  I cannot give medical advice but I would suggest to you as a fellow seekeroftruth and medical consumerfellow human being please get a second opinion if you have any doubts regarding this diagnosis and prescription BEFORE TAKING THIS MEDICATION While untamed bp over a long period can definitely damage blood vessels heart and other organs cause heart attack and stroke the taking of medications to treat a nonissue in this area can also cause significant illeffects to put it mildly I hope this helps you and I wish you the best in your continued search for the truth regarding your diagnosis Blessings It happens in many pregnacies but alway always go to a doctor and make sure Never take a chance with a pregnancy This is something that only his doctor who is treating his kidney problem should handle People with kidney problems are usually  For the doctor I would see a gastroenterologist  I think it is a swollen gland I get them sometimes as well You probably broke your tailbone Ive done the same it really hurts but is not serious but call your doctor just in case  just a few of those Commonly the stated symptoms are found in sinus infection Some people do also feel an increased sensitivity or headache when they lean forward because of the additional pressure placed on the sinuses Some may also experience tooth or ear pain fatigue or bad breath Drinking lots of water is fine but too much is bad because it exerts pressure on the kidneys and over a period of time you may suffer some type of an ailment related to your kidneys Moreover the sodium levels may also get very low There may be a number of reasons that may be the reason behind the excessive thirst for water such as diabetes kidney or liver disease head injury burns or infections or even psychological disorders Please refer to an experienced doctor The sinus problems can cause tooth pain The pain can also be related to the grinding as that can cause inflammation in the ligaments around your teeth The affection of the maxillary sinuses causes an ache in the upper jaw maxilla and teeth Poor dental health bleeding gums or not

Dont ice it brisk  wlking Heat is ok Ive that too Go see ortho Ive did the lock the facets injection and physio Its getting better But after the injection ive mood swings Spine is better now I had 2 wives and they both had entrometriosis This is where the endrometrium or the lining of the uterus spills out into the abdominal cavity and takes root like a vine in your landscape Not saying this is your problem but its pretty common and its pretty serious The common side effect was painful and pronounced menes We were lucky to have a good doctor who did laprosopic surgeries to burn the implants with my second wife to manage her implants We went about 3 years at one point between laps because she didnt have any symptoms but one day she started pissing pure bloodwith no pain Turns out it had grown around her right ureter and choked off her right kidney killing it Long story short she lost her right kidney and her uterus in one surgery So dont fool around with it Whether its your disease or not just keep it in mind Read all you can about this disease I also have a daughter that started her menes at 8 years old Way too soon obviously Still havent figured that out yet Read all you can Good luck My left foot aches along small toe side and in joints above toes Hurts when I press on spot in middle half way between toes and archmetatarsal Hurts to walk normally Less painful if I keep foot flat Is a bit swollen Was on an airplane with athleticwalking shoes for about 6 hours Was swollen at bedtime Hurt a bit to walk next day Today hurts more Have been taking 4 Ibuprophen 3 times daily Also in 99 hot tub Which relieves somewhat Something that helps and what I have used for my son who has had constant earaches since birth is to dampen a washcloth with water place it in the microwave just enough to get hot without drying it out probably about 1530 secondscheck often until it is almost too hot to hold Then place another wash cloth over the hotwet one so as not to burn the skin and lay the ear on top of it The point of doing this is to allow some moist heat into the ear for comfort and possibly loosen and drain the ear They do make over the counter earache drops I think in the childrens section but it is just to ease pain not clear infection so if it is severely infected it will be best to get some antibiotic and they will usually prescribe some stronger drops as well Something my grandmother had done when she was little was for a smoker to blow cigar or cigarette smoke in the affected ear And my fatherinlaw told me that a neighbor who was nursing would squirt breast milk in his ear for infection and it would help him No No no Im not a medical professional but you should get to the dentist or doctor immediately The infection can spread to your eye or worse
