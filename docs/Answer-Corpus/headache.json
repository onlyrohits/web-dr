attack Dont want to cause undue worry but I had those symptoms that was leading up to my heart attack Pregnancy can be a scary time and all women worry about whether something they did might harm their baby The best advice is to never take any medication both over the counter and prescription during pregnancy without first discussing this with your doctor The first trimester is a time where the baby is developing and miscarriages happen A few studies have suggested that medicines like ibuprofen which is a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug NSAID can increase the risk of a miscarriage in the first trimester But other studies have failed to find a connection A recent study done at Vanderbilt though has good news This study looked at overthecounter NSAID use in pregnant women during the first six weeks of pregnancy and found that there was not an increased risk of miscarriage There are also concerns that NSAIDs can cause heart problems in the baby in the third trimester In general women should avoid medication use during pregnancy if possible and always talk to their doctor first Most experts think that acetaminophen Tylenol rather than an NSAID is a safer option for occasional pain relief during pregnancy It would be good to see a competent orthopedic specialist They have many tests such as xrays CT scans MRIs discograms that can help diagnose your condition Have you

Take care I dont have an answer I have the same problem and am looking for an answer your blood pressure is to high you should stop eating so much sodium or salts and also stay away from pork and other salty meats your eating to much meat and procesed foods when you eat meat your body first treats it like something intruding which makes your imune system weak and it takes so long to digest it makes your cells tired and iritability comes with being tired try eating raw fruits and vegtables and take vitamins daily look up Gerson theory Sure you could have depression or anxiety Ask many doctors what brought most patients into their office for treatment and theyll tell you that its stress driven It doesnt matter if it is a cold or hypertension or some other malady it is a fact that our bodies process emotional stress through negative physical complaints It does not mean that you are behaving strangely it just means that you are human and living in a faced paced society in 2014 So what action do you take After all it is not normal to feel the way that you feel and dangerous to your overall health Here are my suggestions Discuss the symptoms listed in your posting with a family doctor Have a complete physical examination to ruleout physical disease Eat a healthy diet and engage in regular exercise as permitted by your doctor Enroll in a yoga class or stress reduction class Secure some close friendships to share your feelings Enroll in a volunteer activity Enroll in a fun class like dancing to meet new people to learn something new and to occupy your spare time Listen to music of your choosing Surround yourself with positive people Take a nice vacation Drink plenty of water If all else fails do not hesitate to meet with a professional counselor or visit a stress reduction support group Medications may also help but are usually not necessary and should be a means of last resort Congratulations on making the decision to cease your alcohol consumption You are describing a condition called Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome Withdrawal side effects from alcohol in the body affects individuals differently Some will experience none to little in the way of side effects while others will have severe physiological and psychological symptoms Around the 4th or 5th day the symptoms of Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome tend to be at their highest level of intensity At this point in your individual detoxification from alcohol the acute physiological withdrawal symptoms should be under control Some of these symptoms may include sweating headache vomiting low grade fever blackouts intense thirst hallucinating seizures hand tremors racing heartbeats generalized anxiety and others Withdrawal from chronic abuse of alcohol over the course of years is serious business and can result in a medical emergency situation In situations such as your alcohol withdrawal medical supervision would have been the preferred method Your current uncomfortable physical and psychological symptoms should be investigated and not ignored Based upon your history of heavy alcohol usage I strongly recommend that you have a complete physical examination ASAPto assess your overall health It is possible that some long term neurological conditions and deleterious system changes or organ damage may have resulted from years of heavy alcohol dependence No matter what lingering negative symptoms that do remain youre still ahead of where you would have been without stopping Over the course of time the quality of your entire life should improve for the better I applaud your efforts at restoring normalcy into your life The challenge now is to remain abstinent from alcohol usage through life style changes and support systems that you put into placeYou just got off from a swaying 24 foot ladder at perhaps the 20th foot If you get back on the same ladder it will be at the same 20th foot After years of chronic alcohol dependence unfortunately we dont get the opportunity to start over again at the first rung of the ladder Best wishes for your continued success Please allow me to restructure your questions into my own words Your questions were 1What do you recommend 2Is it safe for me to be treated with both Ecotrin over the counter coated aspirin product and Fluoxetine  Prozac  You also made the following statement  I took the Fluoxetine yesterday and was really feeling bad had a headache and felt kind of funny My Answer  No it is not safe Based upon your symptoms of experiencing a possible negative drug interaction you should immediately stop taking these medications and notify the prescribing physician Temporarily stopping these medications until receiving clear instructions from the doctor should not adversely affect your health Comment It is prudent judgment to listen for and respond quickly to your bodys messages It is also very important to report all prescribed medications being taken along with all over the counter medications herbs and supplements to your doctor and pharmacist Yes I would recommend being evaluated through the hospital emergency room Preferably youll go to the Hospital ER that is associated with your recent 4 day admission Along with the current clinical exam possible CT Scan and other testing the ER doctor will have a clear historical and updated picture of your acute pancreatitis and gallbladder disease course treatment and prognosis As with most medical conditions early diagnosis of a problem can make the difference between a positive or negative outcome Some of the symptoms listed in your question do suggest pancreatic andor gallbladder maladies Acute pancreatitis may present with some of the following symptoms Bolded symptoms below are also shown in your question Coincidentally Gallbladder Sludge Bile not expelled by the gallbladder during normal metabolic functioning has some of the same symptoms as acute pancreatitis I know all too well of the potentia l for negative consequences if your symptoms are ignored My 58 year old brother died a painful death from acute pancreatitis Please consider calling 911 and have the medical professionals evaluate your physical symptoms I do not believe that your 1998 gastric bypass surgery is responsible for your listed symptoms Since your doctors dont have any answers it is time to open the door to emotional causes as the reasons for your feeling poorly Save Restless Leg Syndrome the dizziness headaches vomiting reflux and body aches all fit in with depression as your culprit Perhaps having an interview with a mental health professional to assess your depression would be beneficial Talk therapy along with medication may improve your psychological outlook on life and reduceeliminate your depression If you are not currently taking an antidepressant medication one may be needed to restore some joy in your life If you are currently being treated with an antidepressant medication a change in the medication or its strength may be justified Sometimes anti depression medications just stop working or even cause more depression following longterm usage As a side benefit to the depression lifting physical disorders often improve It is an agreed upon fact that our emotional state of mind directly influences our physical health Some family doctors report that up to 23 of their patients complaints can be traced back to emotional difficulties such as chronic stress and depression Lastly as a graduate of gastric bypass surgery joining a support group could be a key ingredient to your feeling better Youll be able to listen and share with others in a nonjudgmental fashion ask questions and make lasting friendships My answer is intended to be respectful and helpful You deserve resolution of your symptoms As a followup to my original answer the link below will open a WebMD article on the relationship between depression and physical symptoms httpwwwwebmdcomdepressionphysicalsymptoms In and by itself an axial temperature of 969 for a 14 year girl is considered to be within a normal range The so called average human body temperature of 986 degrees F is only a benchmark Many factors influence body temperature including activity level age sex illness method used to take the temperature and time of day Here are some reasons for the variations  Working and exercise activity may increase the body temperature  Older people tend to have a lower body temperature  Women before ovulation tend to have a body temperature that is 12 degree  1 degree lower than 986 F During ovulation the body temperature may be 12 degree to 1 degree above 986 degrees F and then returns back to its usual normal temperature Pregnancy can also cause body temperature fluctuations  When an individual is physically sick especially with infections the body temperature can increase greatly  An axillary temperature Armpit may produce results 12 to 1 degree lower than 986 degrees F Therefore your temperature if taken orally might have been a very respectable 979 degrees F Other methods such as rectally ear vaginally and forehead will yield slightly higher or lower temperatures 12 to 1 degree F than oral readings During sleep the human body temperature usually decreases by 12 1 degree F After awaking and as the day progresses with activity the body temperature also increases back to normal  Yes the fluctuations do appear to be normal I do not think that your yawns dizziness feeling cranky or shaky presentation are related to blood sugar results being out of range Your reported blood glucose values appear to be very much in the normal range Here are some guidelines for blood sugar value ranges established by the American Medical Association as follows Upon waking up before breakfast 80 to 120 Before meals 80 to 120 2 hours after meals 160 or less At bedtime 100 to 140 PCAS or Polycystic Ovary Syndrome may be causing some of your uncomfortable symptoms such as mood swings andor depression You may have developed heat exhaustion Being outside in 90 degree heat for three hours can cause heat exhaustion symptoms such as headaches fatigue disorientation and lightheadedness Engaging in any work related activity under 90 degree temperatures can exacerbate the severity of your headaches The ear ringing and tingling teeth are not typical symptoms associated with heat exhaustion but may be additional signs of body temperature and balance irregularities unique to your body Perspiration happens in response to the body attempting to cool down In order for perspiration to achieve its intended mission adequate body fluids must be available and the air flow must be conducive to absorption into the skin In your question you state in part I have been walking a long time and was sweating a lot until the last 10 minutes of the trip Based on that statement I believe you stopped perspiring perhaps due to dehydration and your body became overheated I would seek the advise of a medical technician and get an MRI Thanks for your responseI went to the Dr and I am pregnant and I live with my childs father so it wasnt any need to get in touch with him Hes been supportive thus far Thanks again For many years I suffered from terrible headaches Only when I slept did it go away I found out that theres a shortage of progestorone in my body After starting with treatment it dissappears Maybe you can start with testing all your hormones take them to the hospital For your any dental problem plz click here  confidentdentalcare  For your any dental problem click here  confidentdentalcare I can understand this feeling Once in awhile I get those annoying headaches that come then go In your case I would expect it Sometimes people may get headachesaftermaths of a incident I got them for a couple of days then it was gone I dont know much about aspirin but I guess if it helps then stay strong and go on If you feel that you dont get the answer on this then go see your doc They are there to help you Hope this helped  I am sorry you are going through all of that I know that blood pressure can be hard in people Im not a doc or a therapist but I will say that if you want to get out of this you will want to have less stress and think positive Stay strong and go on Call your Doctor they will have all the answers that you need for post op recovery I dont know for sure but I believe our bodies fight to restore itself I was once told to give it 2 weeks or more depending on the severity Dont over exert yourself let your body heal One may have the wrong strenght in their personaland or reading glasses Search Internal Shingles on Google Or heres a link httpwwwlivestrongcomarticle27808signssymptomsinternalshingles  Closed head injuries are a major issue in sports particularly with children Concussion is what we call a closed head injury and managing patients both in the initial post injury period and the ensuing days to weeks can be challenging  As for post concussive symptoms headache concentration problems dizziness sleepiness and a whole bunch more are all symptoms that can be present For how long is very individual People need to be symptom free at rest before the begin resuming ANY exercise program or sporting activity This is even more important in kids as they are still developing their brains There are more and more docs now who specialize in both concussion management and helping getting people back to normal activity If your son is still symptomatic I would get him seen by a local sports medicine doc who is knowledgeable in concussion Benefits Relief without the harmful effects to your body I know that marijuana treats every symptom you just described However be careful because I had almost the same experience as the previous contributor Got in trouble they still treat us like criminals and had to quit Turned to drinking now my liver is failing even though I quit 6 months ago and went back to weed But now I have a warrant for my arrest because I quit taking my UAs To me it came down to follow the courts orders or live I chose life you need to take a deep breath and calm down next make an appointment with your doctor to get on some form of anxiety medication Second I would contact a mental health care professional to see if they can help get to the underlying cause of your over excitementnervousness It also seems you may have a case of hypochondria I have chronic migrains and I have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder When I get anxious I almost always get a migraine and I visibly shake for a number of hours The symptoms you described happen often in people that work out without drinking enough water Even if you think youre drinking plenty try drinking more and see what happens Im sorry youre going through this It certainly sounds unpleasant I suggest you get checked out by your gynecologist Several issues could cause the symptoms youre describing one of which is  Although its thought of as a middleaged womens condition endometriosis can occur in women of all ages Endometriosis occurs when the tissue that normally lines the uterine wall begins growing outside the uterus Typically this tissue attaches to other structures like the ovaries or the bowels Im not diagnosing you with endometriosis by any means I just wanted to give one example of a condition that could cause symptoms similar to what you describe An ovarian cyst is another possibility And so I recommend you make a trip to the gynecologist A physical exam coupled with some other testing can get you diagnosed and treated so you can stop having these uncomfortable symptoms Wishing you well A couple of suggestions Dehydration can cause headaches so make sure youre drinking enough water during the day All you really need is plain water Sports drinks can contain a lot of sodium so if youre not working out strenuously you dont need a sports drink Just make sure youre getting 810 glasses of water each day Another thought is caffeine withdrawal but that usually starts earlier than bedtime If you normally consume caffeine in the morning your body may react to even small reductions in the amount of caffeine Usually these headaches occur within a few hours after you last consume caffeine however If the headaches dont go away feel free to make an appointment with your primary care provider PCP to discuss the situation On occasion a chronic headache can signal a larger health problem Best wishes to you You need to call your gynecologist as soon as possible to determine if you are in fact pregnant or if youre having trouble with your IUD An intrauterine device IUD is considered an effective birth control method so you should not be able to get pregnant However no form of birth control is 100 foolproof If you are pregnant and have an IUD its important to get a diagnosis as soon as possible You cant go through an entire pregnancy with an IUD in place Its also possible for an IUD to become dislodged or penetrate the uterine wall In short a number of scenarios could cause the symptoms you describe and you need to find out whats going on as soon as possible Best wishes to you So basically what this means is your child has some polyps or cysts in his sinuses which are cavities beyond or beside the nasal passages The maxillary sinus is the cavity behind the cheek The sphenoid sinus is located more toward the upper bridge of the nose sort of below the inside corner of the eye Polyps in these areas are common but they can block mucus from draining out of the sinus cavities which can cause a headache are not cancerous They may be treated with corticosteroid nasal spray If that doesnt work polyps can be removed surgically Its a pretty simple surgery thats usually done on an outpatient basis I hope this helps Its hard to say So many illnesses begin with the symptoms you describe that guessing what you have would be folly Youll have to wait until things progress a bit further to really know whats going on That said you might consider calling your medical provider to let them know about this because the flu influenza can cause these symptoms If you are diagnosed with flu within 48 hours of onset you can be treated with an antiviral drug However a cold virus or even severe pollen allergies also could cause the symptoms you describe Like I said you might have to wait and see what develops Meanwhile drink plenty of fluids get some rest and take some overthecounter pain relievers if youre not allergic to them Wishing you well It means you should go see your primary care doctor to find out whats going on here Since youve been off the amitriptyline for three weeks the medication should be totally out of your system That means your symptoms must be due to something else You need a physical examination and possibly some lab work to figure this out Its not surprising the vaginal pain returned after you stopped the amitriptyline since vulvodynia is a chronic condition Hopefully youll find something else that works to treat it without side effects Wishing you well If your goal is to eliminate your by having a  I have bad news for you While female hormones may play a role in migraines this link hasnt been firmly established Many women who have had hysterectomies have migraines To answer the other part of your question having a hysterectomy will remove your uterus so you wont have a period anymore However if you leave the ovaries intact you will still have a hormonal cycle In other words you may still notice changes in your mood on a monthly basis as long as your ovaries are producing estrogen If you have your uterus your ovaries removed you will go into surgical  The symptoms of this are the same as regular menopause so some women opt to go on hormone replacement therapy to ease symptoms like hot flashes and trouble sleeping I urge you to discuss your migraines with your health care provider Treatments for migraine continue to evolve Maybe your doctor can help you find a medication or other therapy that relieves your headaches Hope this helps Im sorry to hear about your accident Ouch I certainly would suggest you get this checked out It sounds like you might have a  Concussions can vary from mild to severe If youre having pain around one eye my concern would be that you damaged some of the delicate structures around your eye socket That definitely deserves to be checked by a medical professional as well as getting an assessment of your head injury in general Because this happened over a week ago I dont necessarily think you need to go to an emergency room Id suggest phoning your primary care provider and explaining the situation so they work you in as soon as possible If they cant get you in within a day or two then I guess Id suggest you head for an urgent care I mean on the one hand this doesnt sound like an emergency anymore but on the other hand it probably needs to get checked out sooner rather than later Just for future reference if you ever hit your head hard enough to black out even for a moment or if you experience dizziness fuzzy memory nausea or any of the other  you should go to the emergency room I wish you all the best and hope you feel better soon Im sorry to hear youre going through this My best advice is to go back to the doctor Even though the initial diagnosis was muscular pain thats not the final word on the matter If your symptoms are continuing to go on for months after the diagnosis this deserves to be reinvestigated It can frequently take several followup exams to accurately diagnose a condition Returning to the same health care provider who first diagnosed you would be a great move because he or she will want to know that your symptoms havent gotten better And you can also let him or her know about these new symptoms skyrocketing blood pressure and hammering heart Many conditions reveal themselves slowly so the more complete your medical history becomes with a single medical provider the more accurate a picture that provider can get of your health I hope you feel better soon I would say you need to have an oboe teacher evaluate your playing form It sounds to me like youre blowing too much with your facehead and not enough from your diaphragm You should always generate the wind for your woodwind from your belly not from your head or upper body You might consider doing some exercises that strengthen your abdominal muscles or core so that you can breathe in the proper way to blow into your oboe Im not an expert on playing musical instruments which is why youre better off consulting a music teacher than a nurse  Wishing you well Im sorry your mom is going through this It sounds like a very uncomfortable situation If its been less than a week since your mom saw the doctor then you may just need to hang in there awhile longer The symptoms you describe could be caused by many conditions including a cold virus You may need to take a watchful waiting approach to see if the situation gets better or worse If it gets better then great If it gets worse Id suggest a return trip to the doctor Keep in mind Im just making suggestions I am not in a position to suggest a diagnosis or give medical advice Hope your mom feels better soon Im sorry to hear youre going through this Yes you should have this checked out as soon as possible If you can get in to see your primary care provider PCP quickly that would be your best bet If you cant get an office visit at least try to speak with your PCPs nurse Since your PCP has all your medical history his or her office is in the best position to advise you what to do about this A headache that doesnt go away is always a reason to see a health care provider Longterm headaches can be a symptom of a larger problem I wish you all the best with this It sounds to me like you need to visit a doctor Im sorry if that sounds flippant but its the truth Critically low vitamin levels can cause serious physical problems That said I question where youre getting your data Blood levels of vital nutrients hormones like testosterone and other substances can only be measured by a blood test A blood test can only be ordered by a licensed health care practitioner such as a doctor nurse practitioner or physician assistant If your health care provider ordered tests that returned a result of critically low levels then that individual should have followed up with you to instruct you how to proceed such as taking vitamin supplements or whatever If you believe you are experiencing symptoms related to a lack of specific vitamins or hormones you clearly should see a health care provider as soon as possible Wishing you well Based on your description here it does sound like you could be having  A visual disturbance prior to the headache is a common  Other symptoms can include Sensitivity to light or noise Nausea or vomiting Feeling unusually hot or cold Dizziness And thats just a short list Not everyone who gets a migraine will experience all of these symptoms Because you said this has happened to you twice Id suggest consulting a medical professional You can start with your primary care provider While the symptoms youre describing can indeed be caused by migraine your health care provider will want to rule out any other potential causes If it does turn out youre experiencing migraines your doctor can provide you with treatment options Sorry youre going through this Headaches of any kind can be a miserable experience Gotta love a person who admits she has a short fuse and a hot temper Id suggest you make an appointment with a medical professional for a physical examination When you push down on your shin bone and the skin stays indented that is a sign of fluid retention in the legs This symptom combined with your shortness of breath warrants a checkup It might just be that you need to cut back on salt But it could also be sort of an early warning sign of additional heart problems besides your mitral valve regurgitation It wouldnt be a bad idea to get this checked out so if it is something with your heart youve caught it early Wishing you and your temper all the best Im sorry to hear this Headaches can go beyond annoying to actually disrupting your life If youre in otherwise good health you might try increasing your water intake Dehydration can cause a chronic lowlevel headache Caffeine withdrawal also can cause a headache so if you drink coffee or other other caffeinated beverages regularly any reduction in your intake could give you a headache If your headache has any of the features of  Id suggest you see your health care provider for an evaluation For many people migraine is treatable If your headache is very severe or just wont go away Id again recommend you see your doctor A chronic headache can be a symptom of an underlying medical condition that can only be diagnosed by a physical examination I hope you feel better soon Sorry to hear youre going through this No fun Assuming youre not allergic to ibuprofen Advil and youre not taking any other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents naproxyn aspirin prescription pain relievers with NSAIDs in them you should be AOK to take some ibuprofen for the pain If you have any questions about this though feel free to ask your pharmacist first Dont forget to take ALL of your antibiotics Dont be that person who gets to the final two pills and decides its too much of a hassle to finish the bottle Dont do it Take them all Its important Feel better soon The answer to your question is yes and no Or more specifically no and yes are cloudy areas on the lens of the eye These cloudy areas can make it hard to see If your cataracts get bad enough you can have minor surgery to remove the cloudy lens and replace it with a clear one Cataracts themselves do not cause headaches However if your cataracts cause you to squint a lot or hold reading materials very close to your face these activities can cause you to get a headache I guess you could say cataracts can indirectly cause you to get a headache If you have cataracts and believe they are causing you to have headaches see an ophthalmologist to find out if its time for you to have your cataracts treated Wishing you well Well this certainly deserves to be investigated by a medical professional I can think of a number of conditions that could cause the symptoms you describe Hypoglycemia possibly But also seizure and stroke So its important to get a true diagnosis and not rely on what he was told decades ago as a child Id suggest you start by calling your primary health care provider for an exam and blood work That will give you and your husband a good start Wishing you all the best Thats an excellent question and Im glad you asked First of all its important to realize experiencing a severe headache while taking a blood thinner can be a sign of a medical emergency especially if its accompanied by sudden weakness dizziness confusion or the inability to speak clearly In that case you should call 911 As you probably know all the overthecounter headache remedies called nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs NSAIDs have bloodthinning properties Therefore it may not be a good idea to combine them with a prescription anticoagulant blood thinner NSAIDs include aspirin ibuprofen and naproxyn Read the label of any brand name medication to see if it contains any of these So what does that leave you with Acetaminophen Tylenol is the primary overthecounter pain reliever that does not contain an NSAID Assuming youre not allergic to it you can try taking plain acetaminophen to see if that helps your headache Your best bet is to call your medical provider to find out what he or she recommends for a simple headache when youre taking a blood thinner Wishing you all the best Because you are symptomatic you have a headache you should not wait another week to see your doctor That said you probably do not need to rush to the emergency room either What you need to do is call your doctors office and tell them your blood pressure has been running high and you have a severe headache I can assure you your doctor wants to know this He or she may call you back with instructions for increasing your medication At the very least your providers office will advise you what to do in terms of bringing you to the office or telling you to seek emergency medical attention Remember however ultimately are in control of your health decisions If you truly feel this is an emergency situation you should take action Wishing you well My concern is for your immediate safety Severe dizziness and balance problems can cause you to fall and injure yourself You need to make sure you have someone with you at all times to help you get around Using an assistive device such as a walker is not enough Also you need to call your doctor as soon as possible to report these symptoms andor find out the results of the scan you just had done You typed November 2012 If that is correct then you should be getting the results soon If thats a typo and you meant 2011 then you need to seek immediate medical attention for these new symptoms Do not delay in getting these symptoms checked out I wish you all the best Good question At least it sounds like youve been able to isolate the condition as occurring only in your own house Thats a start in trying to figure out whats going on A couple of possibilities spring to mind First is dry air Lack of humidity can cause all the symptoms you describe and is common in regions where people run the furnace in the winter At the other end of the spectrum is mold Im not necessarily talking about toxic black mold but rather the more common mold and mildew that occur in humid climates If your house feels dank or if you see mold growing beneath the kitchen sink or in other areas that could be the source of your symptoms How about allergies Are you allergic to cats Did the previous tenant of your house own one or more cats If so you could be having an allergic reaction to the cats that used to inhabit your house Other allergies could be at the root of this anything from grass or plants maybe theres some particular tree or bush growing outside your window that gives you an allergic reaction to formaldehyde in the carpeting If you can find an environmental cause such as dry air or mold you can take steps to mitigate the problem Either humidify the air or get rid of the mold If this is some sort of allergic reaction it may be much harder to pinpoint the cause In that case your only option may be to move out of the house Sorry youve been suffering and hope you can figure out the root cause soon My short answer to your question is this Any time youve got a lump on the head and youre worried about it its OK to go see the doctor A major point I want to make is this Never take a bloodthinning pain reliever such as Advil ibuprofen also goes by the name Motrin aspirin brand names Excedrin Bufferin Anacin etc or naproxyn brand names Alleve Naprosyn after hitting your head These medications can cause bleeding which could turn a notsoserious injury into a very serious injury Im glad your husband seems to be doing fine and its always better for the swelling to be on the outside of the skull than the inside However if your husband has the black dots at the center of his eyeball slurred speech or loss of balance you should take him to the doctor right away These can be signs of a more serious head injury With a bruise the size youre describing its likely your husband has suffered a  These may range from mild to severe Again if you have any concerns about the extent of his head injury your safest bet is always to seek medical attentionSince its been more than 24 hours since the accident you dont need to rush to the emergency room But you definitely can get evaluated at an urgent care facility or ask your primary care provider to work your husband in for an appointment soon Best wishes to you For the most definitive answer you should pick up the phone and consult a pharmacist He or she can tell you what overthecounter medications are safe to take with Tamiflu generic name oseltamivir In general however it should be OK to take an overthecounter pain reliever with Tamiflu Oseltamivir is an antiviral medication It does not contain pain relievers If youve come down with the flu Im sorry to hear it and wish you well First of all thank goodness you apparently dont have meningitis How scary In answer to your last question Yes I think the ER doctor should have explained to you exactly what to expect after your lumbar puncture In fact you should have received some sort of written instructions Beyond that I think they should have given you additional verbal information about what to expect due to experiencing six attempts Its possible the site is still sore because of multiple tries and because of hitting a tendon However if you begin to run a fever its time to seek medical attention Fever could be a sign of infection Lumbar punctures are performed under sterile conditions but infection can occur afterthefact I dont think four days of soreness at the puncture site is unreasonable but if youre concerned you might give your primary care provider a call It never hurts no pun intended to get these things checked out I hope you feel better soon Call Your Dr Immediately or go to the Emergency room That is just what I would do Maybe youre pregnant Or maybe its a side effect from your bc cranberry juicebut to get rid of the bacteria and symptoms you will need antibiotics Congrats on the decision to quit alcohol use The thought of experiencing painful withdrawal symptoms is what prevents millions of individuals from seeking alcohol detox The truth is that the severity of your symptoms will depend on how much alcohol you have been consuming the frequency with which you have been drinking and how long youve been doing it During your alcohol use chemical toxins have been collecting in your system Detox is the process of flushing those chemical toxins from your body Your central nervous system has grown accustomed to your alcohol intake so when you stop drinking your body may begin to crave something it is used to getting that you are no longer giving it This is exactly what withdrawal symptoms are and they may present in a number of different ways Alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be both physical and psychological Physical symptoms usually include  Insomnia  Sweating  Headache  Nausea and vomiting  Increased heart rate  Loss of consciousness  Tremors  Seizures Psychological symptoms may also include  Fatigue  Anxiety  Irritability  Depression Symptoms may begin within a few hours after the last time alcohol was consumed and may last up to 48 to 72 hours It is important to note that psychological withdrawal may continue long after the physical symptoms subside Many AA members in recovery report having psychological cravings years after they stopped drinking Another complaint that some people experience during detox that is more serious is the occurrence of DTs or delirium tremens The DTs usually emerge within three to five days after you quit consumption and are periods of confusion disorientation and hallucinations Delirium tremens can also be physical such as the shakes and sweating and if left untreated they can be fatal IV therapy medical detox is seen as one of the best methods for alcohol detox as it works to reduce the amount of withdrawal symptoms experienced by the individual IV therapy medical detox should be administered under the supervision of a physician and is relevant because it allows the physician to make any necessary changes to the medication protocol as the withdrawal symptoms change which keep the patient comfortable Gallus Detox

contains acetaminophen as one of the three active ingredients along with caffeine and aspirin Make sure to follow the instructions on the bottle closely to make sure you are taking appropriately and for the correct reasons I would be careful taking Maxalt daily on a regular basis This medication is not designed or recommended for daily use It is to be taken within the first hour of migraine symptoms It doesnt prevent the onset but rather helps to relieve symptoms from the migraine I would seek a second medical opinion about using Maxalt daily Laudanum is an opiumtype product still available but not for the use of migraine relief I suggest consulting your health care professional if migraines or headaches are an issue and you are seeking treatment Currently the only safe overthecounter medication for the treatment of headaches during pregnancy is Tylenol acetaminophen Make sure you are using a product that only contains Tylenol acetaminophen and not other ingredients Remember to follow the directions according to the labeled product or as your health care provider advises If this medication is not working consult your obgyn to find a medication that is effective but still safe for your unborn baby There is no stronger overthecounter medication for headache or migraine pain relief Headaches are very individualized There are several overthecounter medications you can use to alleviate painful headaches These medications include acetaminophen Tylenol an effective overthecounter analgesic pain reliever and antipyretic fever reducer medication This medication can help with achy pain stiffness and fever However it does not have any antiinflammatory properties This is important for some types of headache relief In addition the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug class NSAIDs consists of products like ibuprofen Motrin Advil and naproxen Naprosyn Aleve which work by exhibiting analgesic relief antipyretic and antiinflammatory properties Lastly combination products such as Excedrin Migraine contain acetaminophen aspirin and caffeine These ingredients combined make a more powerful headachepain reliever than the ingredients separated out alone It is important to follow the instructions on the label of over the counter medication and not to mix products in order to prevent overdosing or toxicity Monitor the frequency and intensity of your migraines to know when it is time to seek professional help and possibly the addition of a prescription medication There is a moderate drug interaction between these two medications The disabling of the motor coordination and mental alertness is effected with one medication alone Both medications give an additive effect or intensify the side effects Depending on the dose doctors worry about respiratory depression However if the medications are taken according to the physicians directions there shouldnt be any issues Just be cautious of the cognitive capabilities while on both these medications There have not been any reports of drug interactions between ibuprofen and Adderall Continue to consult your pharmacist to make sure there are not new updates concerning the administration of both these medications together There have not been any reports of drug interactions between Adipex P and Midrin Continue to consult your pharmacist to make sure there are not new updates concerning the administration of both these medications together Many people have tried using herbals Several herbal medications have been associated with aiding in pain relief such as black willow meadowsweet passionflower and valerian It is very important to remember that herbals are not monitored for safety and effectiveness by the FDA Therefore we do not know how they work or if they work The side effects could be more intense than the benefit of taking the product Research is limited when it comes to herbs However we have seen many studies done using acupuncture and massage therapy with migraine patients This is thought to relax the body to aid in the decrease of muscle tension and stress levels and prevent the onset of migraines Check with your insurance company because sometimes these migrainereducing therapies are insured services You shold go to a doctor as soon as possible It might be nothing so dont worry about it too much but its better to be safe than sorry You answered yoru own question  But what happens when you drink a different type of alcohol such as Wine or cleardark liquors Do you have the same immediate headache By doing simpe trial and error you

during sex so you dont accidentally overstimulate your brain with sexual thoughts and feelings which is what makes you ejaculate early id advice to seek medical attention right away No there is no guarantee the pain will go away Most people that have undergone back surgery will continue to have pain all their life It will help but the pain will probably continue The degree of pain will depend on how invasive the surgery is and how much damage has been done prior to having surgery This is most likely a problem within your digestive system either your colon small intestine and all areas that digest your food after it passes through your stomach This is quite dangerous as your food is not being properly digested at all and should be treated by a physican You can start with your PCP but it sounds as if you need to see a gastroenterologist this is an MD that specialize in problems with the stomach and the digestive system Any of the OTC medications that people take for headache and fever will help for someone that has hypertension just be sure and read the label carefully There are many brands of medications on the market that say you can safely take if you have high blood pressure just be sure you choose one that is safe for someone to take that has high blood pressure Also check your blood pressure more often than usual while taking medication You really need to see your physician He will most likely refer you to a Neurologist The numbness and the headache can be serious and should be checked out with an MD immediately I know I got it tired once and cut but like you said it could have untied I took a test 3 days into me being late which came back negative but i have like I did with my first 3 so I have no clue Ive done my research on the tubal ligation and damn

have waited too long and if youre still having symptoms I think youd be wise to see your eye doctor The flu influenza and the common cold are caused by different viruses The flu is caused by infection with influenza viruses The common cold is often caused by rhinovirus infection although a number of other viruses also can cause coldlike symptoms Influenza and the common cold have similar symptoms and it can be difficult to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone In general the flu is worse than the common cold and symptoms of flu including fever cough sore throat muscle or body aches and extreme tiredness tend to come on suddenly People with colds are more likely to have a runny or stuffy nose although the flu also can cause those symptoms Influenza infection can result in hospitalization and sometimes even death while colds are usually milder and generally do not result in serious health problems The best way to prevent the flu is by getting a flu vaccine each year Also good health habits like covering your cough and washing your hands can help stop the spread of many germs that make us sick It wouldnt hurt to see one Worst case they say to just keep doing what youre doing Nothing to lose Get a second opinion I had symptoms and just knew something wasnt right I also got cleared by the first doctor but kept going until I found one that figured it out 4 doctors later Mine started with I was 16 so I know how she feels But she knows her body best and knows when something isnt right Keep searching Best of luck I had the exact same symptoms I am an 18 year old female Im not sure which issue has caused the symptoms but recently I found out that I have a lesion in my brain and I also have hormone imbalances I would recommend seeing your doctor Keep searching until you find the answers It sounds like it could be an allergic reaction to the bleach Well the good news is brown blood means old blood Meaning youre not currently bleeding I have started periods with brown blood also Ive had ovarian cysts myself and know how painful they are so maybe it could be a cyst However if it is very painful you should get it checked out and if it is coming from the right side you should go to the ER just to make sure its not your appendix I know bursting cysts feel a lot like an appendix attack so it is best to have it checked out Also if you are having 45 days between periods you might want to mention that to your doctor as well Maybe you could ask about taking a birth control that only contains one of the hormones Ive taken one like that before Definitely see a doctor about this They might refer you to a neurologist if they think its needed I the same symptoms and more on top of those and I did need to have some tests done I kinda figured that it might be MS for the last few months now since my vitmain d and white blood cell count was low im getting concerned but my parent doesnt see it that way instead they blame it as common problem id get tested for it but the test are to painful for me to bare i could handle a MRI but that spinal tap from a neurologist no way that needle going in my back Yes There are nerve roots between the bones that connect each vertebra If you have a slipped bulging andor herniate disc depending on which way the disc pushes it can affect any nerve that leads to the head andor anywhere else in your body and cause pain Thanks Missy but I dont smoke Do you drink energy drinks or take anything with fairly high doses of niacinVitamin B3 The symptoms you described sound like the ones I had when I had a niacin overdose reaction If you are drinkingtaking anything with niacin in it please stop That kind of reaction is serious and can lead to liver damage I actually meant to say anything with high doses of Niacin should be avoided You have to have SOME Niacin Vitamin B3 in your diet It is one of those necessary vitamins I dont know you sexual history but if you have had sexual intercourse You could be having a miscarriage or even worse a Tubal pregnancy If you feel either of these could be the case you need to contact your OBGYN right away If you have not had sexual intercourse there are many things that can affect your cycle Except for the fever it sounds like my daughter When she was 10 she got a bad virus she did have a fever at that point and never got better We went to Mayo Clinic after 2 years of being sick and undiagnosed we went to every specialist that exists She has POTS She is still chronically ill but can now function enough to go to school Headaches is listed as one of the side effects for Phentermine But as a pharmacist I do have concerns about what is massive I would like to ask this patient how frequently are they getting these headaches Are they keeping a headache diary How long have they been on this medication What is the dose and have they made the physician or healthcare provider aware of this side effect For pharmacist I am probably going to refer them right back to their physician to have them reevaluated because this might be something that they need to be changed And I would also ask the patient if theyre using this just as a onetime kind of weight loss pill or they continuously taking it because sometimes if you take it for a long time the side effects could get a little worse The most important piece of information that I need to know is how old is the child and how much does he weigh I will also need to know what other medications you may have given him I would recommend Tylenol or an acetaminophen product to start for the headache I would also ask a few more questions about the sinus pressure to define it more Benadryl is OK but I would probably recommend a Claritin or Zyrtectype product because they work longer and have less side effects This is a popular question that I get a lot at the pharmacy For a headache you can take Tylenol or acetaminophen This medication is safe to take if you have stomach ulcers You want to make sure you follow the dosage instructions on the package and if you have any questions talk to your pharmacist  we will be happy to answer questions like this It may be due to TMJ I had a swollen lymph node in my neck left side for months and then it disappeared The diagnosis was TMJ NeedyMedsorg has information on thousands of free lowcost or sliding scale clinics drug discount coupons and nearly 1000 application assistance programs which help consumers navigate the confusing application process RXAssistorg offers a database of pharmaceutical company programs that help patients pay for medication My brother has has hypoglycemia He eats snacks throughout the day When he gets a real bad blood sugar drop he gets a migraine He can take a sugar pill glucose or an insulin injection Better see a doctor could be a high pressure or allergic reason I have been having the same issue and was told to monitor barometric pressure Ive noticed anything above 3020 begins the onset of headaches which in turn create migraines I also have a small aneurysm in one of the arteries along the brain so I have to monitor my BP and noticed that also creates headaches My eyes start to swell then comes the pounding on the left side of my top high temple Sometimes I see things not common Aurua I call then small black balls the spin and just move every where I look those are all symptoms of a migraine if you havent been diagnosed with them see a neurologist does the pain in your head a constant or is it throbbing around or near the same place that is a classic sign of a migraine I wanted to further clarify that I do not get nauseous after eating am not pregnant and do not smoke or drink Thanks Yes It is OK to take a Vicodin if you have taken an Imitrex There are no significant drug interactions Whenever you have a question like this it is best to contact your pharmacist who knows your complete medical history and all the medications you take  and can help you best Migraine is a chronic condition of recurrent attacks Most but not all migraine attacks are associated with headaches Migraine headaches usually are described as an intense throbbing or pounding pain that involves one temple Sometimes the pain is located in the forehead around the eye or in the back of the head The pain usually is unilateral on one side of the head although about a third of the time the pain is bilateral The unilateral headaches typically change sides from one attack to the next In fact unilateral headaches that always occur on the same side should alert the doctor to consider a secondary headache for example one caused by a brain tumor A migraine headache usually is aggravated by daily activities such as walking upstairs Nausea vomiting diarrhea paleness cold hands cold feet and sensitivity to light and sound commonly accompany migraine headaches As a result of this sensitivity to light and sound migraine sufferers usually prefer to lie in a quiet dark room during an attack A typical attack lasts between four and 72 hours An estimated 40 to 60 of migraine attacks are preceded by premonitory warning symptoms lasting hours to days The symptoms may include sleepiness irritability fatigue depression or euphoria yawning and cravings for sweet or salty foods Patients and their family members usually know that when they observe these warning symptoms that a migraine attack is beginning An estimated 20 of migraine headaches are associated with an aura Usually the aura precedes the headache although occasionally it may occur simultaneously with the headache The most common auras are 1 flashing brightly colored lights in a zigzag pattern fortification spectra usually starting in the middle of the visual field and progressing outward and 2 a hole scotoma in the visual field also known as a blind spot Some elderly migraine sufferers may experience only the visual aura without the headache A less common aura consists of pinsandneedles sensations in the hand and the arm on one side or pinsandneedles sensations around the mouth and the nose on the same side Other auras include auditory hearing hallucinations and abnormal tastes and smells Complicated migraines are migraines that are accompanied by neurological dysfunction The part of the body that is affected by the dysfunction is determined by the part of the brain that is responsible for the headache Vertebrobasilar migraines are characterized by dysfunction of the brain stem the lower part of the brain that is responsible for automatic activities like consciousness and balance The symptoms of vertebrobasilar migraines include fainting as an aura vertigo dizziness in which the environment seems to be spinning and double vision Hemiplegic migraines are characterized by paralysis or weakness of one side of the body or mimicking a stroke The paralysis or weakness is usually temporary but sometimes it can last for days Retinal or ocular migraines are rare attacks characterized by repeated instances of scotomata blind spots or blindness on one side lasting less than an hour that can be associated with headache Irreversible vision loss can be a complication of this rare form of migraine For approximately 24 hours after a migraine attack the migraine sufferer may feel drained of energy and may experience a lowgrade headache along with sensitivity to light and sound Unfortunately some sufferers may have recurrences of the headache during this period Caffeine can increase the blood pressure but the effect usually only lasts for a short time Experts have yet to make a strong link between caffeine and long term high blood pressure That being said a lot of doctors tell patients that have high blood pressure or heart disease that they should limit their caffeine A boost even a temporary one in blood pressure may not be a good idea on top of already high blood pressure Besides coffee caffeine is found in tea energy drinks soft drinks and even in chocolate Some headachepain medicines also have caffeine in them Your daughterinlaw should let her doctor know how much coffee she drinks as well as other sources of caffeine in her day Too much caffeine is often a cause of sleep problems or can make existing sleep problems even worse Hope this helps Anyone who suffers from chronic headaches or worse migraines knows that lack of sleep can sometimes be the culprit And anyone whose been victimized by a migraine also knows that losing sleep can be a trigger for these excruciating and often debilitating special types of headaches Ive talked about the connection between headaches and sleep  or lack thereof Now we have more evidence that shows the link between sleep deprivation and migraines pain researchers from Missouri State University report that rats deprived of REM sleep showed changes in the expression of key proteins that suppress and trigger chronic pain In other words the quality of sleep was associated with whether or not the rats nervous system was aroused hence leading to a headache or shut down At the center of this observation was the existence of specific proteins that orchestrate the nervous systems arousal or suppression In the study the researchers deprived one group of rats of REM sleep for three consecutive nights while allowing another group to sleep normally They found that the sleep deprivation caused increased expression of proteins p38 and PKA which help regulate sensory response in facial nerves thought to play a key role in migraines known as the trigeminal nerves Lack of REM sleep also triggered increased expression of the P2X3 protein which is linked to the initiation of chronic pain About 12 percent of the population or 36 million Americans suffer from migraine headaches Migraines still elude scientists sleep disruption is one of the most important migraine triggers yet very little is known about the molecular pathways that link sleep to headache pain So for now the best we can do is try to control them through medications when they strike and to take preventive measures that target potential triggers People who suffer from routine migraines typically have powerful drugs on hand to aid in enduring a migraine when they occur but often preventing the throbbing pain from even starting is the best medicine It can become a catch22 once the migraine takes hold it becomes hard to sleep due to the pain which then fuels the cascade of events that keeps the migraine pulsing Making sure you get enough sleep if youre prone to headaches or migraines wont always stave off pain though Whats more important is keeping the same sleep schedule Ever gotten a headache or migraine on a day you slept in Well yes you can get too much sleep If your body is used to rising at 6 am during the work week and you suddenly switch to 9 am on the weekend guess what Youve just given your nervous system a reason to summon pain The body likes routines And it especially likes consistent sleep routines What I love about studies like this is that they have longitudinal implications across other areas of medicine If we can learn how to prevent and treat a migraine we can probably learn a lot about pain in general And if sleep is a key to that treatment and prevention then getting restful sleep is once again proven to be as much a part of health as any other vital sign of life There are many potential causes to this including a nerve problem Given how long its lasted and the fact that is hasnt gone away its time to get your doctor to check you out You need to have an examination by your doctor to determine what followup tests you may need to get to the bottom of the pain As you said these arent typical headaches and the description of your symptoms does not automatically point to something in particular I definitely would not stop taking the Fosamax without first talking to your doctor You dont want to risk having more problems with kidney stones The side effects you list are not commonly associated with Fosamax Of course everyone is different and its possible that theyre associated with the medicine but it could also be something else There are also other medications similiar to Fosamax that the doctor may want to try if it seems like the side effects are due to the medicine Yes due to sexual tension build up and also because sex is used to relieve stress so when you dont have sex you can easily become over stressed which will lead to a headache and possible fatigue You may want to get checked for diabetes My

Treatment  Asthma Herbal Remedies Headaches are usually not a feature of multiple sclerosis However headaches are a common problem and many MS patients have migraine headaches along with their MS The headaches need to be treated since the constant pain can be very demoralizing and make life more difficult Your sons neurologist should be able to work with him to find a medication that helps his headache pain You should be checked out to be sure you dont have a concussion You may have strained your neck more likely than any kind of spinal injury but conking your head could have resulted in a bruise on the brain  thats what a concussion is and you dont need to have lost consciousness to have one I had a number of concussions that were not treated in the past and regretted it Its better to check it out than to be sorry After all your brain is the most important organ in your body A promptcare location or your local ED should check out your head and neck In the meantime put some ice in a baggie and rest it gently against your head Keep your head elevated Dont take any meds that could fog your head and make a diagnosis difficult Good Luck If you still have those symptons you need to go

Benadryl or Childrens Claritin or Zyrtec The slight headache can be improved by ibuprofen or acetaminophen Painful urination with blood especially in someone who is diabetic is a urinary tract infection until otherwise proven Yes you need to see a medical provider but not necessarily the ER this is not an emergency a regular medical office or urgent care facility would be fine and less expensive In the meantime drink plenty of water Yesyou have a very high blood pressure There can be hundreds of causes of headachesunfortunately I have no way of getting additional information or examining you to make an association between your high blood pressure and your headache It is very important for you to SEE a medical professional so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated You are having vague nonspecific symptoms that could be an indication of many different diseases Unfortunately it would not be possible to sort out the many possibilities blindly over the Internet There are hundreds if not thousands of medical conditions that could cause your vague symptoms It is impossible for me or any medical professional to be able to determine the cause of YOUR symptoms since we do not know anything about you your medical history or have any way of examining you or ordering diagnostic tests I would suggest that you head off to Student Health or an afterhour urgent care facility so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated A cheap quick test for what Unfortunately when you have the array of medical problems that you have listed there are no cheap quick tests for anythingwhether you have insurance or not You need to be under medical care so that you can have your headache evaluated your blood pressure monitored your congestive heart failure managed and vision disorder checked These are not things you can do over the counter so it would be in your best interest to find some affordable care As far as I know medications used for erectile dysfunction do not really help premature ejaculation This is an entirely different problem and there are no medications to fix it If you have a shortfuse so to speak then the advice from one expert was Who said that you only have to have sex once The first one may be fast but as soon as you get by a brief refractory period the second time you have sex will last much longer So instead of worrying about premature ejaculation just have sex more than once at a session Of course you will need a cooperative and understanding partner Finding the underlying reason for your premature ejaculation is going to take some research on your part and a bit of soulsearching Here is an article that I think you find helpful httpmenwebmdcomtcprematureejaculationtopicoverview I think any person with a significant head injury that may have been a concussion should be medically evaluated The fact that you are still having postinjury headaches dizziness and nausea indicates a need to be carefully examined Continue to take your blood pressure on a regular basis at different times of day and in both arms One isolated reading that is elevated is not as important as having several elevated readings Your medical provider will need to see your log of these home readings so please make an appointment As far as your headache and tinnitus is concerned there can be a relationship but it will be up to a medical professional  someone who can carefully examine you and look for other causes for these symptoms  before an association is made Yes you could have a sinus infection Symptoms can vary from person to person but some of the symptoms that you mentioned in your question are often seen in sinus infection Many sinus infections are viral and will be selflimiting in a weeks or so but some can be bacterial and require medical intervention like antibiotics In order for you to be properly diagnosed and treated you will need to see a health care professional for a examination first I have no way of blindly diagnosing you over the Internet but I can tell you two things about mono First the screen test mono spot is not very accurate if taken too early in the course of the disease and second a better test would be an EBV panel There are many illnesses that can give you monolike symptoms so you should have your blood test repeated in a week with the more accurate panel and of course see your medical provider again if your symptoms continue You didnt really ask a question but nothing you have shared is that alarming This is typical of a viral infection but as you know I have no way of blindly diagnosing or treating your granddaughter over the Internet so you will need to have her properly examined if the symptoms persist or worsen I am very sorry but we do not know anything about your grandsonnot even his age Headaches and fever are very nonspecific symptoms and could be signs of HUNDREDS if not thousands of different medical problems If he has not been carefully examined this would be your first step He needs a diagnostic workup You will need to see your medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated There can be many different reasons to account for your array of symptoms but unfortunately it would not be possible to narrow them down blindly over the Internet Many years ago I volunteered to perform sports physicals at four local middle schools I spent a lot of time in that nurses office and apparently so did many of the students All day long it was a dance of complaints Since the nurses professional hands are often tied when it comes to treatment the most common disposition for a sick child is a trip home Next to tummy aches headaches were at the top of the whine list When I think back to my own middle school days there were plenty of things that can lead to headaches Just being at school all day is a headache to some kids Fortunately for all of us most headaches are not brain tumors or aneurysms In healthy active kids the most common type of headache that is seen is the classic muscletension headache The brain itself does not feel pain but all of the sensitive nerves muscles and blood vessels of our head can certainly generate a doozie of a headache Dont get me wrong headaches can be hallmarks of something more serious but most of the time a random selflimiting headache is just that a headache Headaches are in the body of the beholder A medical provider cannot see a headache which makes this an ideal getoutofschool reason Teenagers tend to be great actors and are able to give a command performance at will Some performances are so good they end up in my office By the time I see them parents are worried about brain tumors meningitis and all types of horrible diagnoses On a one to 10 scale with 10 being the worst headache what number do you give your headache If a comfortablelooking person tells me nine and their mannerism looks more like a one or two I am suspicious I will then inquire as to the frequency of headaches their location on the head factors that may bring on the headache and things the person does to make the headache better The number of missed days from school is another important bit of information I think its a migraine Most people dont have a clue what migraine really means but will frequently selfdiagnose Most feel that the word migraine just indicates a bad headache When I explain to them that a migraine is a certain type of vascular blood vessel headache that usually occurs on just one side of the head usually severe accompanied by nauseavomiting and proceeded by an aura a feeling that a headache is imminent such as blurrywavy vision they will usually admit they do not have these things Migraines tend to run in families and in women may be cyclic related to menstruation Among many other triggers hormonal contraceptives can also trigger migraines in some people Younger children do a lot behavioral modeling They see a parent constantly complaining of headaches and they may get one too Headaches located at the back of the neck or upper shoulders radiating to the scalp and feeling like your head is in a vise are usually muscle tension headaches These can be due to sleeping on several thick pillows flexing the neck or sitting like a slug in those uncomfortable school desks Nervous tension like algebra tests or the day they need to run a mile in physical education all can create tension headaches On examination I can usually find a very sore area trigger point around the nape of the neck and of course no clinical findings suggestive of brain tumors Parents are relieved students not so much Sorting out real headaches from just headache complaints used to avoid something requires a lot of skill and experience Kids will get headaches when they are worried Tension at home like parents arguing or families going through a divorce will trigger headaches in kids A physically or emotionally abusive parent will trigger headaches Bullying at school is another factor When children are being teased or intimidated by other classmates they may use headaches as an excuse to go home Teachers can be bullies too When I recall my elementary and middle school days there were some very unfriendly teachers in my life Teachers should always be respected but never feared In dissecting factors that may be triggering a headache overly demanding mean teachers are often high on that list Rather than just prescribe Tylenol or Motrin it behooves the clinician and the parent to get more information Real headaches exist Serious headaches exist Even those pseudoheadaches deserve our utmost attention If you are concerned that you have anemia the ONLY way that you can determine this is to have a blood test for hemoglobin You will need to have your doctor order this test unless you can find a lab to order one on yourself If you are anemic your treatment options would depend on the extent of the anemia and TYPE of anemia Not all cases of anemia are related to blood loss or irondeficiency in the diet Some can be selftreated by nutritional changes while others cannot As a vegetarian it is your responsibility to make sure you are getting sufficient nutrients including PROTEIN and ironcontaining foodsoccasionally deficient in some vegetarian diets I cant answer that since I do not know the details of your boyfriends injuries or have any way of examining him and reviewing his imaging studies like the CT that was most likely done at the hospital He needs to be under the care of a good medical provider or neurologistsomeone who can do these things Clearly he had a significant head injury but I would not be able to blindly guess the outcome These are vague and nonspecific symptoms Unfortunately it would be impossible to blindly diagnose your friend based on such little information This person should be seen by a medical provider so heshe can be properly examined diagnosed and treated  three things that cannot be accomplished over the Internet He needs to see a neurologist  They will not cure his stubborness however but they may be able to determine the cause of his symptoms and perhap find a solution It is interesting that you used the term penalty of death since these symptoms could indeed be serious and his failure to take care of himself by seeing a specialist could have dire consequences An accurate diagnosis is not made by symptoms alone Without knowing your medical history and have the ability to examine you firsthand there is really no way that a medical professional could determine what you have I am sorry but you will need to seek proper medical care Your first and MOST IMPORTANT step is to get properly diagnosed This is not something that can be blindly accomplished over the Internet There are hundreds of different types of headaches and not all headaches are treated the same for everyone Your body is trying to tell you to a medical professional so you can be properly examined diagnosed and individually treated based on the probable cause of your headaches Dont continue to suffer and selftreat when nothing is working Headaches are really nonspecific They can occur with of illnesses and conditions Ibuprofen Motrin reduces fever and pain including headache pain so this was the normal response to using this medication I dont have enough information to be able to answer that question I do not know the type of seizures you are having and of course I have no way of examining you to determine if your onesided headaches have anything to do with this condition There are hundreds of different types of headaches You would need to consult your medical provider  someone who is familiar with you and your case and someone that has the ability to examine you You cannot be blindly diagnosed over the Internet based solely on a list of vague symptoms If you want to find out what is wrong with you you will need to see a medical provider so that you can be properly examined No that is not a typical sign of early pregnancy since sharp headaches can occur in anyoneeven men The fact that you are experiencing tingling and right arm pain as well I would strongly suggest that you consult your medical provider  someone who is familiar with you and your medical history and someone who can examine you in order to determine the underlying reason for your symptoms In an adult it is not necessary to mount a fever response to Strep Some people do most people do not So you can still have Strepyou were certainly exposed assuming your son was correctly diagnosed Any chance you can get a Strep test Some clinicians will just treat symptomatic parental contacts but that would be totally up to the discretion of the clinician Two things First a CT scan is the definitive test for sinusitis If it was clear then I would question that he is having sinus headaches There are a hundreds of different types of headaches so consider seeing a neurologist for a higherlevel evaluation Second taking decongestants at night is not a good idea because of their stimulent effect and the fact they cause annoying drainage An antihistamine may be considered or perhaps a trial of using nasal corticosteroid sprays to reduce the inflammation It cansome of the muscles of the neck attach directly to the skull This can cause a muscle tension type headache I agree with youtesting him for Strep would have been prudent although he was not experiencing a severe sore throat There can be other reasons intestinal virus to account for his array of symptoms Preventing dehydration is essential I suspect he is nauseated so there are medicines that can be prescribed so that he can drink fluids without vomiting Call his medical provider Some immediate signs of dehydration includes lack of tears dry mouth and a reduced urine flow If he is experiencing these he should be reevaluated immediately by his medical provider That diving incident may have caused a traumatic rupture of your eardrum Now when you get water in your ear it is causing pain perhaps because this rupturehole is still open The ONLY way to confirm this possibility and to provide you with some appropriate treatment would be for you to see a medical professional specifically an ENT specialist You can stay will hydrated Sara but it really sounds like you should be examined by a medical provider to determine the reason for your array of abdominal symptoms There are many many causes for abdominal pain and you should not be selfdiagnosing or trying to avoid seeing a medical provider Yes your period can be adversely influenced by an illness but yours has been late for three months Perhaps this is why it is late this month but as you know there can be many reasons for this as well Are you concerned that you are pregnant Since influenza assuming this is what he had only lasts about a week with the worst symptoms the first few days she has exceeded this time She should be examined for a secondary infection at this point Many people have cold sores in their past history but do not remember or they went unnoticed as being something else Once you have antibodies for the herpes simplex virus it can reactivate at any time in your lifeforever Mono is an entirely different and unrelated virus Mono cannot cause herpes but if a person already has herpes antibodies exposure to an illness or getting an illness could trigger this reactivation response There can be many reasons for your symptoms so please see your medical provider so you can be properly examined and diagnosed She should be tested for mono Ask your medical provider to order an EBV panel  a very sensitive mono test Common area No but herpes zoster shingles follows a nerve pathway so this painful infection can occur in this area Hopefully your doctor prescribed the appropriate antiherpetic viral medications for you These are quite helpfu Pain medication is also important since this can last a while longer How long It would not be possible to make an accurate prediction since this is really up to your immune system but I would expect that you would be considerably improved in a week if you had the antiviral medication The fever headache and flulike symptoms are typical of shingles so hang in there See a medical provider so that you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated You may not know the reasons you are crying and not feeling well but a medical provider would likely have more insight This complicated matter cannot be solved blindly over the Internet so please do the right thing and see a medical professional Noif you are having bleeding issues it would be best to consult your medical provider and have a few blood tests first There is really no way to thicken your blood It would not be prudent to increase your dosage of ANY blood pressure medication without the expressed okay from your medical provider Not all blood pressure medications are the same as you know and I dont know what you are taking There also can be hundreds of reasons for headaches and various types so dont be so sure that your headaches are related Worrying doesnt cure anything especially anxiety It would be impossible to determine the nature of these black spots based on a vague description so you will need a handson professional opinion Your dentist is skilled in this area but your primary care provider or an ENT can also render an opinion You can get a flu vaccine when you have a cold or you can wait a few more days Colds only last about a week Tensiontype headaches would not be uncommon after an anxiety or panic attack Anxiety can cause wholebody responses not just headaches but neckachesbackaches nausea upset stomach diarrhea elevated blood pressure and many other stresslike reactions You didnt mention kind of important what was transplanted and we dont know what type of medication you are currently taking so it would be wise to consult your transplant specialist for patientspecific advice in this matter Yes an infected tooth especially the molars can cause a muscletension type headache That does not imply however that the cause of YOUR headache is a dental source  there are many causes and types of headaches You would need to consult your medical provider or dentist to make that association No it does not There are no rules in medicine that state a person can only have one medical issue at a time so you can have both but they are not related He should a medical provider out of state There is really no way to properly diagnose the reason for the headache and treat him blindly over the Internet There can be hundreds of reasons for his headache so let a medical professional do this Talk to your parents and have them take you to see a medical provider right away It would be impossible to adequately evaluate a person with a headache blindly over the Interent let alone determine if they had a brain tumor You should not have to pester your doctor to get care He is not doing it for freeYOU or your insurance company is paying him At this point you may need to ask for a referral to a neurologist for a higherlevel neurological evaluation No it is not normal Influenza assuming your diagnosis was correct only lasts a week if you dont treat it a few days less if you take Tamiflu Tamiflu does not cure the fluit just shortens the course If you are still having headaches and fever you will need to see your medical provider again Your mother needs to be seen and examined by a medical professional There is no way that the severity of her injuries could be determined blindly over the Internet It would not be likely to get brain damage from smelling a polyester backpack although I have encountered some deadly tennis shoes from time to time You are safe Call your surgeon or primary care doctor for patientspecific advice You may need to have a blood count and certainly be examined I think you will find this information helpful httpwwwwebmdcomsleepdisordersexcessivesleepiness10jetlagremedies You need to see a for an extensive array of testing These visits can last five or more hours and are expensive but insurances typically will pay for them with prior approval Most cases of bronchitis are VIRAL and do not need antibiotics so this could be one reason why you are not getting better as fast as you though It is okay to take amoxicillin with ibuprofen If you have failed to get better on your doctors treatment regime you need to go back and be reexamined otherwise he will just assume you are better Inform him otherwise There can be hundreds of reasons for a child to have an headache not an exaggeration so it would not be possible to get a handle on the reason based solely on the content of your brief inquiry Since this has been going on for MONTHS now and severe it would be in his best interest to have a thorough examination and some diagnostic tests Migraines just one type of a severe headache can occur in children Now he has a low grade fever This may have nothing to do with his headaches since many things can cause fevers as well but it will take a handson examination to make that important association He needs a diagnostic workup starting with his primary care provider or with a pediatric neurologist You should consult the medical provider who examined youthe one who knows that TYPE of ear infection you have I am guessing a middle ear infection the severity and the type of antibiotics you are taking Not all middle ear infections will be problematic after a few days but since I do not know the details of your case you need to get patientspecific advice from someone who has examined youor have someone examine your ears just prior to your journey A tension headache is just one type of nearly a hundred different headaches perhaps the most common type You cannot selfdiagnose a tension headache based on an individual response to acetaminophen If your headache never goes away it would be in your best interest to see your medical provider or a headache specialist for a thorough examination An apple a day keeps the doctor away but I have not heard that a handful of peanuts keeps a headache away There are a hundred different types of headaches and I have not seen a scientific study that shows peanuts would prevent them Assuming you are not allergic you could do your own experiment to try and see if it works for you You need to see a medical professional for a thorough examination There are many different types of headaches While migraines tend to be onesided getting a proper diagnosis with the TYPE of headache you have is very important when it comes to determining an effective treatment Because you are having visual issues your medical provider or neurologist may also want you to see a eye specialist I am unclear as to what you mean by his body creating bad bacteria and what relationship this might have to his headaches or back problems Obviously there is much in the news about the advantages of probiotics good bacteria but I do not know enough about your friend to know if probiotics would help My belief is that adding good bacteria will not really help his headache or back There can be sooooo many different causes of headache and back pain that it would be in his best interest to work closely with his healthcare provider until this issue has been properly evaluated and solved There can literally be HUNDREDS of types and causes of headaches It would be impossible to blindly make a patientspecific determination of the Internet You need to see a medical professional so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated  three things that cannot be accomplished online based solely a brief vague description This has been going on for FOUR DAYSand GETTING WORSE Please get off of the computer and seek medical care Hi to both of you and I too am concerned about my wife Debra who is Type 2 seven rods in her back Dvt in her legs going thorough menopause has alllergies and she has all things that you have been experiencing You have to look at

throw up everywere and dont know what the hell your doing yes go to the doctors as soon as possible better safe then sorry has she seen a neurologist to rule out any serious problems Sometimes you get so used to a drugpill that it starts to not work anymore it might mean that you should try a different pain reliever but it doesnt hurt to get it checked out just incase  Massage possibly the oldest medical remedy for mankind has long been used to treat pain problems It is commonly thought that these are caused by muscular tension of the pericranial neck  upper back muscles More recent research seems to point in the direction of trigger points in these same muscles referring pain into the head A professional massage therapist depending on their training will either assess where your pain is and determine which trigger points may well be firing into those area then treat those trigger points specifically or they will gently press rub  hold tender points in the muscles of the head neck  upper back It normally will take numerous visits to decrease the number of headaches that you are getting If you are getting less than 15 per month those are called Episodic TensionType Headaches ETTH If you are getting more than 15 per month those are called Chronic TensionType Headaches CTTH There are two other classifications of headaches Cluster  Cervogenic along with migraines which are no longer classified as headaches but rather a trigeminal nerve problem A super painful  intense headache is often mistakenly called a migraine because of its intensity but that does not make it truly a migraine TTHs can be terribly intense Talk to your doctor about your very specific symptoms to find out what kind of headaches you may have It is not generally recommended that you seek massage when you headache is hurting as the massage treatment while helping in the long run may actually make it hurt worse is the moment Massage therapy shines at increasing the health of the tissues that are causing the headaches thus reducing the number and intensity of your headaches When the cause of the headaches is the muscles professional massage therapy is one of the most specific and effective remedies for TTH Hi I have Rheumatoid Arthritus I feel that way all the time and also feel an achyness all the time But I think you should go see a Rheumatologist and he can tell weather you have Osteoarthritus or RA Or even if your doctor does xrays and blood tests they can tell I hope you get better soon Tamara My daughter had similar symptoms and tested positive for strep throat You should probably follow up with your Dr May be inner ear vertigo See your doctor I have a suggestion or twohes either lacking sleep or he might need glasses This type of wordfinding problem is pretty common with migraine Tension headache doesnt normally do this but stress can cause both tension headache and difficult talking Usually talking with a neurologist can sort this out Migraines cause dilation of some of the blood vessels in the head There is also inflammation around some of these blood vessels also directly caused by the migraine If this affects the blood vessels in the face the rosacea may become much more noticeable Migraine often causes patients to have a very pale face due to the nausea and feeling sick Rosacea would also be much more noticeable then as well You dont mention if you are male or female  unfortunately some women have increased headaches as they near menopause which is coincidentally when rosacea appears in women There are very few studies of supplements for headaches but there are 2 or 3 things that do have pretty good evidence for migraine prevention Vitamin B2 riboflavin This works OK for headache prevention but you have to take 200 mg twice a day for it to work There was a clinical trial in 1996 that showed this was better than placebo at migraine prevention Butterbur Root Extract also called Petadolex plant name is petasites hybridus There was a nice study in 2004 that showed this was effective for migraine prevention The dose is 50 mg 3 times a day or 150 mgday This occasionally causes an upset stomach but I have not had other complaints of side effects from patients Co Enzyme Q10 This had a nice study done in 2004 showing it was effective for headache prevention Unfortunately they used a form not on the market Ive suggested using 100 mg 2 or 3 times a day to patients This medication is kind of expensive so not very many of my patients have tried it Feverfew This had a recent study done in 2011 showing that when combined with ginger it helped treat mild headaches and helped prevent more serious headaches Combinations of feverfew and ginger are available in stores Be sure to follow the dose on the label  Over the years Ive seen side effects from every medication we use for headaches Verapamil seems to cause the least problems as side effects from this medication tend to be mild when they occur and go away quicly when you stop it Most common side effect is Constipation probably 5 of my patients and may 1 in 200300 patients has puffy ankles from this Ive only had 1 in every 5001000 patients rough guess get light headache or fatigued on Verapamil Propranolol causes fatiguelight headedness in probably 510 of patients that Ive tried it on and in some people can increase the chance of depression On average Topamax causes tingling in the hands in 50 of patients weight loss in 20 not usually a bad thing and trouble thinking in about 2 this is at the doses used for headache prevention Thanks for your Reply This could be a problem with your neck even something simple like a muscular strain in your neck can cause similar problems There is also a type of headache triggered by exercise For exercise induced headaches I usually recommend starting with aerobic exercise only for a very short time just long enough to feel a very mild headache every day and gradually increase the length of time you are exercising If this doesnt really help you would need to see someone at your student health center and they might need to refer you to a neurologist Its very unlikely that your headaches are due to a stroke because a stroke or ruptured aneurysm causes a headache only 1 time when you have it Migraines cause a very very small increase in the risk of stroke we think but there are many other risk factors for stroke that are much more important If you are worried about your risk for stroke you should go for a consultation with a stroke neurologistthey can review your family history and do a few fairly simple blood tests and talk with you about your risk factors Several of the risks for stroke can be modified smoking high cholesterol high blood pressure high blood suger and will reduce your risk Methergine methylergonovine is an ergotamine type of medication It is on the market as a treatment for uterine bleeding that is the FDA approved use Similar medications were used to treat headaches in the past It should work for migraine It is a very strong blood vessel constrictor and has a number of serious side effects some of the side effects caused by long term use could be permanent We dont use this medication in our clinic so Im not sure how long it should take to work As far as I know all the medications like citalopram have headaches listed as a possible side effect I have seen patients with side effects from other similar medications If the headache continues you may need to try another medication Ibuprofen and naproxen aleve are OK to take with citalopram If you have migraine medications at home you can also take your regular migraine medication Unfortunately there have not been any new medications for headache prevention in the last 3 years There is a treatment occipital nerve stimulator that works for chronic daily headaches but it is not yet FDA approved for this The results of a clinical trial of this should be published later this year or early next year As far as diagnosis goes there still is no way to find the cause of daily headaches if the MRI scan of the brain is normal There are some patients with neck problems that have daily headaches so I usually recommend having someone evaluate patients for neck problems as well For treatment we usually try all of the normal medications for headache prevention Usually rebound headaches are treated by a neurologist and its better to find one that treats a lot of headaches Almost any of the prevention medications can help with rebound headaches but I usually start with one of the medications that has an FDA indication for migraine prevention Inderol Depakote or Topamax As these gradually start working you will take less Excedrin and end up off the medication Sometimes changing what you take for a headache helps also such as changing to a prescription version of naproxen or using one of the triptans like imitrex or relpax There are more aggressive treatments for rebound headaches that involve admission to the hospital and IV medications but I usually dont start off with that as the first treatment There are several things you can check with the glasses I wear glasses too when I dont have contact in 1If you have astigmatism the lens needs to be correctly centered on your eyeball and if it is off you will feel off balance 2If the difference between the right and left eye in terms of how strong the lens power is is high more than about 2 number units like 100 in one eye and 300 in the other you may feel off balance until you get used to the new glasses 3 If the power of your lenses is pretty high  or  250 or higher you will notice that things are distorted in your peripheral vision 4 If the nose piecesupport or the temple pieces that go over your ears are not adjusted just right for your face the glasses could give you a headache no ones face is perfectly symmetric and most people have one eye or ear slightly higher than the other Ive had problems with both 2 and 3 above and several patients with problems from 1 and 4 as a cause for headaches Bifocal lens have similar problems as 1 above This could be a type of exertional migraine called orgasmic headache Its pretty rare but something that we see occasionally in the headache clinic There are medical article suggesting that some patients many have a problem like aneurysms as a cause for this but its not really clear if this is really a problem Ive seen a number of patients with this type of headache but Ive never found any specific cause some of the migraine type medications can work for this type of headache if it happens a lot If it happens again you might want to talk with your doctor about an MRI scan of the brain with an MRA mri arteriogram the reason I cant get into the doctor is because I have no transportation My car broke down and I have no way to fix it as of right now Headache is a side effect of Cymbalta no no There are many reasons someone might suffer from daily headaches but it is not normal for anyone to have ongoing headaches Here is some information on that will hopefully give you something to discuss with this girls doctor She needs to be seen by

a cause The cause of back pain is rarely at the site of the pain Most people have slight postural imperfections which end up causing pain in other parts of their body Postural imperfections are magnified by such things as slouching over the computer holding the phone between ear and shoulder and by hand and foot dominance in the sports most regularly played Its not the chair its how you sit

headache It becomes nearly unbearable I have stopped taking the Novolog and within 24 hours or so it goes away I also get extreme weakness shakiness and extreme pain in my spine This is not a listed side effect My doctors have not heard of this side effect nor do they know what could be causing it The only thing I have found is that people with MS and Type 1 I have not been diagnosed with MS and I have Type 2 sometimes get neck pain but it did not explain why Im not sure my doctors actually believe this is happening I also had the same experience when taking Humolog Lantus and Levemir By the way the Lantus and Levemir increased my blood sugar levels I have sensitivity to many medications and often get the opposite effects from what is expected I cannot function from these side effects and I am concerned about not taking the medication I also experience nausea Has your mother experienced anything like this EndFragment You really should go see your doctor Do you have any abdominal pain Maybe you have Endometriosis Endometriosis can mess up your cycle cause headaches and mess with your bowel movements Since you already have two children you would most likely know if you are pregnant Were your other pregnancies like this Best of luck the hache with the light and stuff sounds like a migraine but the swollen lip either could be a bite an absess or their allergic to something they ate so back track and try to remember exactly what they ate they sound like it may be an allergy my neck cracks alot but not that prompts a head ache im not an expert or anything but it could have something to do with the sinuses I have migraines but have not experienced this However I have heard about this from other people I was diagnosed with migraines after a job change and the first thing that I did was reexamine all of my behavior how it was different etc to try and find a pattern What I found was 1 I was sitting at a computer too long each day and 2 I wasnt drinking enough water because i was never getting up My headaches are triggered by dehydration I would suggest you look at the food you are eating any lifestyle changes no matter how small that may have occurred in the last 10 days any new stresses new allergy exposures  and see if you cant figure out what might be causing it Good luck Hi I have had these sorts of feelings when I was overwhelmed with work or family stress But I felt compelled to also send you a link to this article on heart attacks and women  not to scare you  but because you can never be too careful with your health I wonder if you do have a mold or dust problem or maybe caused by wall to wall carpet Another thing to check is whether or not you have a gas leak if you have a gas ovenstove My oven sometimes starts leaking  whereas most people think about their stove only is it right side  if so you should get to a doctor could be appendix is bad Are you doin them right Anyway Anyway are you active during the other parts of the day Because if your like sitting in a chair alllll day typing or whatever then exercise your gonna get sick When my sister got a job as a lab tech she sat in a chair all day and right after work we would work out and she would get sick  Sitting alldayexerscise hard and right after sitting SICK WOW this one is really hard OK so black eyes are bruises And bruises are caused when your pop your blood vessel when you blood vessel bleeds it goes to the bottom of the skinthats why its a dark colour And the reason why this is really hard is it doesnt make sense you didnt hit your eye but its blue Most the times with me my bruise wont show until the nexy day or a couple hours after the incident SO I mean you must have bumped your eye earlier and not have realized it Or mabe because it didnt hurt But if your by anychance hit your eye and its bruise Then tada thats why you got a headache LIke if you get bruise on the arm Arms sore right Well being bruised of the eyeforeheadcheeketc headache THanks Sources EMS Do you have anxiety Could be from anxiety or depressmentl There is a pill called fluoxetine and it helps most of all of those symptoms I would undoubtedly go and see a Psychiatrist MD right away This is not normal and could be signs of something severe or a few things It could be several differing things One a change in anything related to your hormonal system can cause an imbalance and throw a normal period off Did you start a new RX Change vitamins etc Second you might be pregnant I strongly advise getting a blood test And lastly always go and speak with your Dr He or She will be much more likely to pinpoint specifics for you Best of luck I would wait a few more days and see if you get your period If you cant wait then get an early response test The further from your period due date the less certain your results will be Try waiting to test at the most 2 days before your expected period The date that you had sex is around when you probably ovulated so you could be pregnant Only time will tell good luck The benefits are less usage of prescription pain medication regaining an appetite far fewer effects from stress and anxiety depression and it helps with apathy greater empathy for others with like problems and I could probably quit taking some of the 15 other medications I am now taking Another benefit is the time your mind is occupied with while growing learning and having someone to talk to who never talks back but show their appreciation by growing up big and strong The down side of MJ use isuhh isisOh yeah some short term memory loss There are some things Id rather forget than be troubled with every day Another down side is the cost unless you are allowed to grow this medicine for yourself And of course you do not drive under the influence of Marijuana The first problem with MJs use is the amount of time the chemicals remain in your body Even though you are no longer HIGH from MJ it will still be found in a UA or Blood test and even when the effects have left your brain you may still be found GUILTY of being under the influence unless you have an enlightened Judge One other problem is Doctors I treat with a pain clinic and if I turn in a dirty UA I am assured will receive no further pain prescription pain medication Im not sure if this would be legal to allow a person to have to go through withdrawals from Oxycontin and Hydrocodone Ive done it once when I lost my bottle of pain pills and it was not enjoyable When I use POT I use far fewer of them and I doubt now that I would suffer nearly as much as I would when going without There are no withdrawal from Marijuana for me anyway And I cannot believe anyone could actually be called and consider themselves ADDICTED to MJ It is the loss of being allowed its use that brings on added stress and more depression After having used MJ for the prior 28 years for a low back injury and before having to switch Doctors I was just fine Close to the same has now occurred in the Mobile Home Park where I reside facing eviction if I were to be found guilty of doing what the state tells me I can do I have now taken a dont askdont tell attitude I will use again and I will grow again with or without anyones permission even and I hate this if I have to lie to health care workers I have this problem because Ive been honest with my Physicians Never again will I mention Marijuanathis sucks Im no expert but with those symptoms she really needs to see a doctor and right away Sounds like possible heart related issue Id make her go ASAP I have heard of them growing back Try a natural remedy I have always been told eating Yogurt helps headaches idk if it is true but I have also heard peanut butter is good for head aches too Tylenol PM is fine to take Its just Tylenol and Benedryl both of which are fine to take during pregnancy As for the rest I would ask her OB When your Dr orders an MRI and you have it done It is seen by a professional and the results are sent back to your Dr I find it weird that you were told there was something of concern on your MRI And at the same time told it was nothing to worry about I would go to the place where you had your MRI And ask for a copy of the results And take it with you and get a second opinion This happens to my husband most times also He was checked out and the doctor told him it was normal That was ten years ago and hes still fine Well you really need to take a pen or permanent marker and draw a circle around the bite this way you can keep track of the swelling and redness if it becomes You need to go to the

are really good I dont know about all around pain relievers Advile migrane is a gel so it is easy to swallow and fastacting it also lasts all day Excedrin Migrane is supposedly the safest and 1

in your system fro no reason Well the rapid heartbeat could be caused by several factors Do you ingest a lot of caffeine Do you smoke cigarettes Are you prone to anger Does your family have a history

problems w the spine or head and neck area i have the same problem somewhat your going to want to se a dr to make sure but here is what i do for headaches and vision Typical Migraine symptomsI have been dealing with it for 20 years Research it I dont know what doctor you seen but I see a specialist and if you get blurry visions w headache its a migraine BUT see you family docfor piece of mind

have a rise in temperature as your body is trying to cope with it but it just cant quite do it so yes there will be a rise drink lots of water and if gets worse i would immediately go up to the emergency cause if you are to dehydrated and can make you not very well and they can put a drip in and give you fluids Test again and if its still negative go get checked out could be stress causing it or something else It could possibly be a sinus infection ive had migraines for almost 5 years now and no meds or other treatments has helped me and now i realized that with the caffeine abuse i do and anxiety these could be the cause of my migraines idk about you what causes your migraines but it does sounds like you need to see a neurologist they can do an EEG to look at your brain activity always if you cannot get the temperture down your self then you DO NEED to go to the ER and see what they can do it sounds like chronic migraines for me it execessive caffeine and diet issues that causes my headachs maybe read some books about headachs and migraine to see if you can find symptoms on what you are experiencing and see what you can do about it yourself but it might be better to check with a doctor about it sounds to me like it could be a chronic migrianes i had then almost 5 years now but i never had ears stopped up if your ears feel like it ringing or you hear little in it it could be from the migraines or headaches i reccomend to see a neurologist they can do test on you like EEG to look at your brain with different colors to show activity of your brain other than pills several people go see charapractor sorry if it wrong spelling with getting their back popped n massage after a few visit it seem to go away i have chronic migraines for 5 years now and nothing helps me  so far try that to see if it works a doctor had told me for what he does with his paitents instead of charapctor he use acupunture it could also be his diet some foods and drinks can triggers migraines maybe if he old enough try get to write down what causes his migraines and each day from scale one to 10 one lowest and 10 highest have him write down how painful it is for me 5 years experience of migraines orange chocolate or cinnimon smells triggers my migraines each day it always 5 to 10 painful i deal with it certain drinks triggers my migraines too like orange juice or popsoda it could be sinuses going down your throat i get sinuses and sometimes i get it going down my throat and can be little hard to swallow best to describe it is felt like a frog in my throat the throbbing pain yea it could mean a migraine especially if you have chronic migraines i get chronic migraines and i rarely get it in my back of my head but i usually get it throbbing another thing that not mention that it could be cancer  but usually it stress or pregnant i get them too but rarely Allergies or sinusitis You need to see a neurologist as soon as possible immediately The high BP medication might need to be changed I had to have mine changed I had side effects which included headache Id check with the doctor but he has no fever Its the Pepto It happens to me every time I take it and if you read all the warnings on the package it even says you may notice a change in your stool color Nothing to be too alarmed by but if youre still taking the Pepto try laying off for a day or two and see if that helps Sometimes when they do a lumbar puncture it can cause some of the spinal fluid to leak a bitI know it happened to me and it caused me to have a headache for about a week afterwards I just treated it as best I could and eventually the symptoms went away However if youre still suffering after a week I would go to your regular doctornot the ER Tell him what you had done and let him know what symptoms youre still experiencing That way he can see what the results are from your previous tests and maybe order more accordingly Good luck Get Relief from your chronic back

narcotic fever is sign of infection the shivers is a sign of your baby trying to fright the infection sweating is caused by your baby trying to make his or body temp go down  headaches are cause by the fever either way if its flu or something else any higher of a fever can fry the brain and led to brain damage  go to the hospital asap my mother has diverticulitos and you can have a lot of pain because of that take the meds they gave you and make sure you stay on the diet they recommand  also if you cant go go to the hospital asap  a back up like that can posion your body and make u very very sick hope this helps feel better The lump sounds like an abscess I would definitely consult my primary physician about treatment options It could have lead to an infection and can potentially lead to other health related issues I also recommend seeing your doctor Those symptoms can come from a number of different things from GERD to Sleep apnea to Anemia Your best bet is getting a doctors opinion  I used to get headaches in my sleep too First its helpful if you are not dehydrated or still digesting food at 11 pm and beyond because your serotonin is produced then if you dont have food allergies and sensitivities biofeedback is a great way to get a full panel then I might recommend finding a upper cervical chiropractor NUCCCA is their title so you can look them up that way I feel great when I wake up now Hope that helps YES The fact that you are asking that question and you lost consciousness it warrants a trip to the ER Commonly the stated symptoms are found in sinus infection Some people do also feel an increased sensitivity or headache when they lean forward because of the additional pressure placed on the sinuses Some may also experience tooth or ear pain fatigue or bad breath Those may very well be side effects to the shot It would be a good idea to see your doctor to see what you can do I am also on the shot but never experienced those side effects Hope that helped Your blood pressure is low and your pulse is a little elevated Normal BP is 12080 and pulse is 60100 Id get checked out Changes to your blood pressure will change your vision Do you have a history of headaches Do migraines or depression run in your family Are you under increased amont of stress What is your diet like Does it consist of lots of sugar that would make you crash and caffine that would give you a headache if you dont supply your body with enough of it Do you get enough exercise Do you drink enough water Ask yourself these questions and see what answers you come up with It could be many things You have to analyze your personal situation Is it a coincident How much water did you drink  Is it a caffeine withdrawal  Try drinking lots of water before bed If I take humilog late it makes me urinate frequently all night KK You have the same story of my mother She also did not eat sugarless salt and even meat She also experience nausea and vomiting She was diagnosed with hypoglycemia She thought that less sugar will help her in losing weight or even if you are low of protein in the body  Our body needs sugar also Even diabetic people needs it But not too much If you really want to lose weight Find a loss buddy and have a nutritionist  I am doing this too httpbitly1ocaNoB Perhaps this will can help you Even though you were on low dose you may need to dose down from Amitriptiline I took low dose for about 3 months several years ago and I did dose myself down Just spread out your doses Add an extra hour or two or take when symptoms begin and spread it out farther and farther until you can stop Intitially i would say you are probably going through some kind of withdrawal either from caffeine or sugar or carbs etc however if these headaches are still ongoing for that long i would strongly advise going to the doctor to get it checked out its probably nothing major but better to be safe Hope you feel better soon You may want to ask your neurologist about Midrin and Topamax both of these drugs have seemed to help me in the past I have also tried Botox injections  alot of injections around eyes neck scalp as well as my mouth as I twitch there off and on Have tried Botox injections twice now and find them only mildly effective Possibly a allergic reaction or maybe a med interference I have never been able to get any over the counter migraine meds to work besides excederine tension and i was put on fioricet which helped I would say a different ingredient whether inactive or active is in the off brand Nothing really compares to the original Drug or alcohol useabuse Having a MRI on your brain does not hurt I have had one last year and you cant feel anything The only thing is that you have to be still and you lie on your back for about 30 min or so Maybe longer or maybe sooner but try to use the restroom before you have it done And try not to drink so much before the test You can stand and walk after the test They also did mine with contrast and that means that they will inject some dye into your arm but you may feel a warmth come over you but that is normal and then they take some more pictures and then its over Then your doctor will tell you the results  hey iv got a nursing degree and also experiencing permanant weird thought patterns post drug usebut antipsychotics arent doing anything which makes me question what has gone wrong with my mind But for you you are definately suffering signs of schizophrenia in my opinion these are paranoid ie goverment is trying to find you you have auditory and visual hallucinations ie seeing and hearing things that dont exist plus your own language Nerve damage in your neck Pulled muscles in your neck Either way if you are continually getting headaches you need to see your doctor I have this exact problem Good luck Every time Ive ever been they have tested me for pregnancy because of things like xrays and certain medications They also need to know in case you need a blood transfusion or other specific procedures It says on the label that hydrocodone will cause constipation and u can also have reverse reactions to pain medicine such as if your having trouble sleeping that is the opposite of what the label says about it making u drowsy Well that is a dangerous question to ask as you may not like the answers you will get although these issues may be caused by possible dehydration the drink more water part I think it was a brush off on the ERs part It is possible to be something far worse but I am not an MD in any way shape or form but to me it sounds a lot like MS I would have your family doctor look in to it and set up a appointment with a specialist since she is diabetic you have to rule out hypoglycemic headace get a GRBS tested if GRBS is less than 60 mg ask her to take some sugar or candy treatment for gastritis can also be given A neck xray can rule out cervical spondilitis no because it not ideal for you to take all the vitamins together get your blood tested may be the iron level is low or B12 Why have you not gone to the doctor It could literally be anything From HIV to a dangerous flu or disease Hello First off have you suffered from any head injury If so it could be bone On a lesser scale it could be from tension allergies stress etc Are you having any other symptoms If so I say visit a doctor or at least type in all your symptoms in a symptom checker They have one here but I like Healthlines httpsymptomhealthlinecomsymptomsearchpagenum1addtermHeadache I agree with who gave you the answer And like her Im also on it and I think its the best thing in the world No more periods not even spotting and not even one typical period symptom Sorry about your problems with the DEPO I agree with going to talk to your doctor Everybody is different keep that in mind "}
