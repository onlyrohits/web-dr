{"text": "the baby might have whooping cough get herhim checked out for whooping cough it might also be just bad allergies maybe asthma  what it sounds like he is saying is that yes you have an infection BUT its hard to tell right away if its viral or bacterial Your doctor chose to try and treat a bacterial infection by giving you antibiotics Unfortunately for you it seems like it is viral which means you may not have needed antibiotics in the first place They wont hurt you to have had them but they didnt really help anything either Viral infections just take longer to get rid of  I just got over a really nasty viral infection myself Takes a while but hang in there Youre probably not even sick anymore  Sounds like exercise induced asthma Ive never had asthma in my life but after recovering from a cold I was exercising and had an asthma attack My doc prescribed a rescue inhaler for me and Ive been fine since Just be careful that its not something more serious like a heart attack But sounds like asthma yes Not 100 sure but that happened to me  my son  we both ended up having a high lead level and when i do a big sneeze i end up with a stuffy nose then but once i blow it it goes away its not like a 247 stuffy nose like u have when u get a coldwhat can help  Thank you SueBee14 I do take daily probiotics and a multivitamin To clarify I am generally a relatively healthy individual I have never been sick like this before though I have had bronchitis in the past I am not a smoker and I live a healthy active lifestyle Hi there My two year old also had that She ended up having to have an inhaler because her airways would inflate when she was active therefore causing her to have trouble breathing After she used the inhaler for a while it went away and now she is a healthy almost 4 year old We only ever used it the one time I would reccomend it good luck Not a doc but had similar situation and it caused scratchy throat with some very mild bleeding As blood has a coppery taste would stand to reason Took cough med OTC for dry cough to produce gunk Also could be serious BIG HOWEVER See doc to rule out any other infection or  Also have doc rule out any dental issues while heshe is giving you the one over Good luck FYI I saw your original question and the additional information provided in the form of a 2nd question My initial reaction is that it is probably more important to find the cause of your breathing obstruction than to determine a way of managing the situation once it has already occurred Not being able to breathe can be very scary and the episode will probably repeat itself  I answered a similar question on WebMD a few days ago that may be helpful please see the link for the original question and my answer below httpanswerswebmdcomanswers5053420notsleepapneaandnotacidreflux I think that one of the reasons cited in my answer may also apply as a cause for your chocking event Although it is reassuring to know that help was present during your unfortunate breathing difficulty I do not find that striking the victim on the back to be an effective treatment method Instead it is suggested that you remain calm I know that that is easier said than done but please try in order for the throat muscles not to tighten and impede air flow A good place to start your search for a conclusive answer to the problem is with a visit to your family doctor Perhaps a sleep study may also prove to be helpful The average 4 year old and many school age children may have as many as nine colds per year with viruses being the offending agent responsible for their illness Antibiotics will be ineffective in viral cases What is needed is rest fluids time could be a week or longer for antibodies to develop within the body to fight off the disorder and possibly over the counter fever reducers Most childhood colds are best treated at home With that said I believe that when in doubt take the child to the hospital for professional assessment It is better to be safe than sorry Always consider the hospital ER in cases where the child has difficulty in breathing has associated abdominal pains is refusing fluids and in cases where the child has a fever that will not decrease within 3 days or exceeds 1039 degrees The family doctor or childs pediatrician may also be consulted on the best course of action to be taken for cold symptoms or as in your case when a cough has existed for two 2 weeks The link below from a WebMD article on the topic provides more detailed information httpwwwwebmdcomcoldandflufluguidechildrenandfluinfluenzapage2 It could be Sciatica although the pain may be more intense while lying down and sitting with that condition Does the pain extend down to your ankles and feet If so this is suggestive of a Sciatic Nerve disorder Back pain resulting from disc bulging pinched nerves muscle pulls other medical conditions such as growth masses  bone fractures and narrowing of the spinal column stenosis are other possibilities I suggest that you make an appointment to be evaluated by a primary care doctor This individual may review your medical history interview you for the pain quality exact location of your pain pain level flushout possible traumatic events that may have occurred prescribe medications including analgesics and antiinflammatory nonsteroidal drugsconduct blood and urine lab work  get the ball rolling with a radiographic xray This doctor may also refer you to other medical specialists In summary Lower back pain costs the American Economy large amounts of money in medical expenses lost work hours worker compensation claims doctor office visits and intense pain experienced by the patient This type of symptomology requires resolution beginning first with a clear diagnosis Once a diagnosis is established treatment efforts may be started moving from conservation forms like cortisone injections analgesics bed rest pillows placed under the knees chiropractic treatments and ice and heat treatments Although these symptoms sometimes may virtually spontaneously improve in conjunction with some conservative efforts more aggressive testing like MRIs and surgical intervention is frequently necessary It can take a lengthily time to achieve relief months or even years I wish that the process was less cumbersome and more patient friendlyUnfortunately medical insurance companies through their beancounting policies directed at cost saving make most of the bigger treatmenttesting decisions todayThe physician many time finds that their decisions are overturned by some HMO clerk following a complicated reimbursement and procedure manual These sometimes uncaring and reckless institutional decisions can delay diagnosis and the starting of treatment efforts Hopefully a cause for your symptoms will rapidly be determined but please dont count on any quick fix Best wishes for your health improvement  Absolute Neutrophil Count is a measurement of the percentage of the total White Blood Cells that are devoted to fighting infection Normal values may vary from testing lab to testing lab but should fit into an approximate range of 75  105 The result of 123 is above range by roughly 175  This value may indicate body stress or an active infection being fought off by the neutrophils Most of the results that you reported are on the high end of the normal range For example your husbands Ast value of 63 is more than double the high end range of 27 and can sometimes indicate a liver disturbance Of course please do not worry  sometimes we just need an immediate answer that could make some sense I am not a doctor and am not familiar with your husbands medical history My answer represents a good faith effort to be helpful and is by no means a definitive conclusion with guarantees of accuracy The serum blood results could also mean that something else entirely is afoul or have little overall significance All of the testing must be looked at collectively by a medical professional and in conjunction with a physical exam of the patient in order to arrive with an accurate diagnosis I suggest that your husband followup with his doctor for additional testing and possible referrals to other medical specialists Completing the antibiotic treatment may also prove to be helpful I hope that his health soon improves and wish you well Fever isnt necessarily a bad thing its a sign that shes fighting an infection A temperature of 105 F is high in anyone And a fever will only contribute to her misery and put her at risk for dehydration The first step is to make sure she gets plently of fluid Ibuprofen acetamenophen or aspirin can help improve how she feels Check the labels on the medications shes getting since you want to avoid excess dosing Many cold and flu remedies contain many of the same ingedients as these pain relievers If these simple steps dont help Id suggest taking her to the local urgent care center Any chest pain should be regarded seriously especially if it is significant of unknown origin or very sudden Its causes can be anywhere from entirely harmless to immediately lifethreatening so it might be best to err on the side of caution and go to a doctor or emergency room  it is better to overreact and find out that it is something manageable than to wait and find out that it was very serious potentially permanent I think its highly improbable that this has come from lifting your baby not least of all since this started while you were asleep It is very possible that this pain cardiac related but there are a great number of other things that could be causing it Again I would recommend that you seek emergency care for something this sudden  better to be safe than sorry especially since you have a child to care for It could be seasonal allergy Rhinitis It occurs at the time of season changes and people easily get such symptoms So you need to treat it by having medicines like Allegra Such seasonal allergies are caused due to dust and pollen etc So to treat it you may opt for Allegra which is effective nonsedating antihistamine medicine that is intended to be used to treat for relieving allergy symptoms such as hay fever itchy eyes runny nose and others Allegra is easily available on online drug pharmacy Drugpillstore For your any dental problem plz click here  confidentdentalcare  For your any dental problem click here  confidentdentalcare I read this somewhere and tried it I dont know if it was in my head or not but it really did help I also rubbed the Vicks on my chest too though which helped with the congestion which also helped with the cough So I dont know if rubbing it on my feet helped or not but I do know that rubbing on my chest helped For some people thats normal My husband also runs approximately 96whatever and that is normal for him If he runs 986 hes sick Boy do I hear you  because I have the same thing Some people simply have a chronically runny nose Usually the fluid is clear and thin This condition is called   This means your runny nose isnt related to any allergic cause If eating spicy or hot foods makes this problem worse the medical term for it is gustatory rhinitis or gustatory rhinorrhea Either way theres no cure Theres no cure for nonallergic rhinitis either If youve tried overthecounter pills and prescription nasal sprays without relief Im not sure what to suggest More hankies Sorry I cant be of more help but at least take comfort in knowing youre not alone About 20 million Americans suffer from nonallergic rhinitis Take care Im sorry to hear youre experiencing this If by feels like it will explode you mean you feel increased pressure in your head whenever you bend or cough this is a cause for concern As you know Plavix generic name  is a blood thinner Obviously when taking a blood thinner you dont want to break a blood vessel  especially one in your head Id advise you to see your doctor as soon as possible about this He or she will be able to determine if you should continue using the clopidogrel Plavix or whether a different medication or none at all may be more appropriate for you In the meantime exercise caution when bending lifting or coughing If you need to use throat lozenges for example to calm a dry throat please do so I wish you all the best Well I vote yes I think youve waited this out long enough While some viruses can linger beyond 14 days most of them are history at the twoweek mark It sounds like your symptoms are not getting better so that means its time for a trip to your primary care provider He or she can assess your symptoms and provide treatment to get you back on the road to health Feel better soon Im sorry to hear youre going through this It sounds very unpleasant A viral infection such as the common cold can last as long as 14 days though most people only experience symptoms for up to a week So its possible this is a virus On the other hand it could be a sinus infection Ive heard patients describe a crushing sensation with sinus infections No matter whats causing your symptoms I think after a week of suffering through them you deserve a diagnosis Id suggest visiting your primary care provider to see whats going on If its something that can be treated with antibiotics then youll get a prescription and should feel better within days after starting on the meds If you do receive a prescription for antibiotics be sure to take the entire course of pills Do not stop taking them just because you begin feeling better This is very important Youve done the right thing by trying to treat the symptoms with overthecounter products but obviously that hasnt helped I hope youll now seek medical attention Youve earned it All the best to you Longterm smoking generally does increase the likelihood of developing  If the coughing and spitting up mucus while smoking are new symptoms it could be a signal that lung damage is occurring including the development of COPD Id suggest your husband see a doctor about this The coughing and spitting may or may not be related to the smoking He will only find out by having a physical exam Keep in mind smoking damages more organs than just the lungs Smoking can have a negative impact on the heart urinary bladder colon mouth throat and many other parts of the body Quitting smoking is always the best option but I realize it can very difficult for some people to do And some people simply dont want to quit smoking I hope your husband goes for a physical exam to find out how his lungs and heart are doing I wish you all the best You need to call your pediatrician as soon as possible to let them know about these symptoms in your baby It could be that he simply has a common cold but you dont take chances with an infant If your baby begins turning blue around the lips or under his nails or if he is running a fever as measured rectally you should seek emergency treatment by calling 911 Otherwise just try to get an appointment with your pediatrician as soon as possible Please review this list of  which provides excellent guidance Meanwhile its very important you keep your son well hydrated by making sure he nurses regularly Do not give an infant water Keep an eye on how wet his diapers are and if you notice his urine output decreasing you again need to seek emergency medical treatment for him Use a suction bulb to remove mucus from his nasal passages to help him breathe better and keep a close eye on him when hes sleeping Here are some more excellent tips for  I hope your son gets better soon Im sorry to hear youre experiencing this There is a particularly nasty virus going around this year that seems to produce a lingering cough However you should see a health care provider for an evaluation In general its not uncommon for a cough to linger as the last symptom to clear up after a cold That said any time a cough hangs on its good to see a doctor The fact your cough is productive that is youre coughing up gunk could be good or bad Its usually good to be moving that stuff out of your lungs but it could also be indicative of bacteria brewing down there If you have a fever along with the productive cough you definitely should see a health care provider I hope you get well soon Sorry to hear youre suffering through this I think its probably time for you to seek medical attention The thing is it could be your appendix Or it could be something else entirely If it is your appendix and its inflamed swollen or possibly infected it probably wont get better on its own But then again it may not be your appendix at all Could be your gallbladder Or a hernia The only way to tell for sure is to get a physical examination  along with these other symptoms you need to see a doctor as soon as possible Think urgent care or emergency room If youre not running a fever you might be safe to wait for an appointment with your primary care provider if you can get in within the next couple of days Feel better soon Im sorry youre dealing with all of this It sounds miserable While nothings impossible its highly doubtful the steroid treatment caused the symptoms that developed in January Even though youve been thoroughly checked out if the symptoms persist you should consider continuing to follow up on them Many disease processes develop slowly over time This means an initial workup all those tests you had done wont always reveal an answer If you get tested later something may show up I want to add also that I wouldnt jump to a conclusion of cancer or precancer Nothing in your description would lead me to think cancer Id just recommend following up again with your health care provider until the problem gets resolved Take care Im sorry youre going through this It sounds absolutely miserable Because this situation is now going on three weeks I would suggest you get it checked out You may be able to avoid the emergency room and the high fees involved by searching in your community for a free or lowcost health care clinic Sometimes these have the name healthcare for the homeless but you usually dont have to be homeless to take advantage of the services I cannot provide a hotlink here but if you visit httpwwwhrsagovgethealthcareaffordableindexhtml you can search for lowcost health care in your area I wish you all the best with this I hope by now you have sought medical attention If not please do so right away if your symptoms have not improved Whenever someone describes tearing pain in the left abdomen we in the medical community start to get a little excited because this can be indicative of a serious condition called an AOA Although the pain is usually described as being in the upper left quadrant of the abdomen I would not hesitate to get this pain checked out pronto A symptomatic AOA is a medical emergency and should not be taken lightly Youre at higher risk for an AOA if you are male over age 60 and if you ever smoked in your lifetime If this describes you seek medical attention now Of course this could be a bout of severe constipation which is easily treatable But better to rule out an AOA first Meanwhile do not strain to have a bowel movement If you do have an AOA straining could cause it to rupture Im not trying to alarm you but I do want you to get this checked out as soon as possible Wishing you all the best Well its hard to say A number of conditions could be causing the pain you describe Unless youre running a fever you probably can safely take a watchful waiting approach to see if the situation improves If you begin to run a fever you definitely should seek medical attention Lowerright quadrant pain frequently is associated with  By the way appendicitis is considered a medical emergency so if you spike a fever AND the pain gets worse youve won a ticket to the ER However many other nonemergency things could cause the pain youre describing For example a piece of hard stool could be stuck in the intestine temporarily This is a frequent cause of abdominal pain of all kinds In this case the stool eventually moves on and the pain goes away Even a pocket of intestinal gas could cause the symptoms you describe As always my usual advice in any medical situation is this If things start moving toward worse instead of better see your health care provider Meanwhile get a thermometer dont rely on whether or not you feel hot to the touch or anything of that sort monitor your temperature every four hours is fine and just keep close tabs on the situation Chances are it will clear up on its own Wishing you well Because you vomited after taking the  Id suggest you contact the health care provider who prescribed it to let them know This can signal an allergic reaction but it could also have happened simply because you were nervous about taking the antibiotic Let me reassure you that your doctor would not have prescribed azithromycin knowing you were pregnant unless he or she thought it was safe for you That said I would definitely suggest you get in touch with your doctor to discuss your concerns the vomiting and diarrhea and see if he or she can prescribe something else for you I also invite you to participate in  where you can connect with experts and other momstobe Wishing you and your baby all the best Im sorry your baby is going through this Good for you for following the instructions to the letter in using the inhaler Its very important to use all medications for infants exactly as prescribed Because your baby has developed new symptoms you should take her back to the pediatrician Although this may sound like the same cough as before her persistent coughing could be a sign of something else going on Your pediatrician will want to examine her and perhaps run additional tests to look for answers Meanwhile I would call the pediatricians office to ask whether it is OK to continue using the inhaler Generally doctors like to see the patient when she is exhibiting symptoms It may be uncomfortable for your baby to be coughing a lot but it also may be important for the doctor to see this during the examination Your pediatricians office will guide you as to whether or not to treat the cough between now and your visit Wishing you well Good for you for quitting smoking That is a true achievement to be proud of In terms of the persistent cough one year later That is a good question and I would advise you to take it up with your primary care provider physician nurse practitioner or physician assistant Several possible explanations for the coughing come to mind First depending on how long you smoked you may have permanently damaged your lungs which results in their inability to clear mucus Although youre not coughing up any phlegm it could still be residing down there in your lungs and triggering a coughing response Second smoking damages more than just the lungs Again depending on how long and how much you smoked you may have damaged your heart muscle If the heart cannot contract with enough force to move blood through the lungs properly it causes to occur This congestion can cause a dry hacking cough  especially when youre lying down I think you definitely should see your health care provider for an exam The cause of the cough may be highly treatable if caught in time Best wishes to you If your grandmothers cough has changed from dry to productive that is she is coughing up gunk from her lungs then Id suggest you take her back to the doctor Older people are more susceptible to getting pneumonia so youll want to have a doctor rule that out If your grandmother is running a fever 101F or higher you should seek immediate medical attention at an urgent care facility or the emergency room This combination of symptoms could signal an infection  again like pneumonia Meanwhile try to help your grandmother stay hydrated by encouraging her to drink fluids Good hydration will help keep those secretions thinner and less sticky so she can cough them up more easily If your grandmother is being treated for high blood pressure or congestive heart failure dont push an extreme amount of fluids In general several glasses of water a day should be all right though Wishing you both the best I suggest you return to your health care provider for a recheck You could be experiencing a new illness thats unrelated to the sinus infection Or perhaps it wasnt a sinus infection after all but a virus that has now gone down into your lungs Regardless if youre having trouble breathing its worth getting checked out Hope this helps Im sorry youre going through this I hope its been resolved by now but I wanted to answer for the benefit of others too It sounds like youve received a good diagnosis from your gynecologist Ovarian cysts can be very painful and its not uncommon for that pain to radiate or have the pulling sensation you described The truth is the brains not always very good when it comes to pinpointing where pain is originating That could be why you feel the pain has shifted slightly from your pelvic area to your belly button area Because you have a solid diagnosis by the gynecologist I wouldnt head to the emergency room Instead you could call your regular gynecologists office and ask the answering service to have the oncall doctor call you back if they have an oncall doctor or wait until morning and call the office to speak with the nurse They will be able to advise you about what to do and what pain control measures to take Again Im so sorry youre coping with this Ovarian cysts can be very painful and scary Im sorry to hear you go through this and if it helps Ill share this It happens to me too Some people are just naturally prone to flushing when theyre embarrassed angry or otherwise experiencing heightened emotions Have you ever noticed whether or not your neck flushes for no reason at all Mine does Sometimes I can just be sitting around minding my own business get up to go to the bathroom and notice my necks all red What the heck I dont know if theres any medical explanation for this Ive noticed personally that it seems to happen more in fairskinned people of north European descent It could simply be that flushing which is caused by increased blood flow just beneath the skin is more visible in fairskinned people I dont know If possible try to learn to live with this unique trait When people tease me about this I laugh right along with them I say things like Some people wear their heart on their sleeve I wear my emotions on my face If the anxiety aspect bothers you dont hesitate to seek counseling from a trained psychotherapist Anxiety can be managed through cognitive therapy talk therapy and medication if warranted A counselor also can help you cope with the embarrassment you feel about the flushing I wish you all the best as a kindred spirit Good question At least it sounds like youve been able to isolate the condition as occurring only in your own house Thats a start in trying to figure out whats going on A couple of possibilities spring to mind First is dry air Lack of humidity can cause all the symptoms you describe and is common in regions where people run the furnace in the winter At the other end of the spectrum is mold Im not necessarily talking about toxic black mold but rather the more common mold and mildew that occur in humid climates If your house feels dank or if you see mold growing beneath the kitchen sink or in other areas that could be the source of your symptoms How about allergies Are you allergic to cats Did the previous tenant of your house own one or more cats If so you could be having an allergic reaction to the cats that used to inhabit your house Other allergies could be at the root of this anything from grass or plants maybe theres some particular tree or bush growing outside your window that gives you an allergic reaction to formaldehyde in the carpeting If you can find an environmental cause such as dry air or mold you can take steps to mitigate the problem Either humidify the air or get rid of the mold If this is some sort of allergic reaction it may be much harder to pinpoint the cause In that case your only option may be to move out of the house Sorry youve been suffering and hope you can figure out the root cause soon Im hoping you meant to type 102 degree fever because 112 degrees would send most people into seizure and death Im sorry youre going through this It sounds like you are absolutely miserable While I cannot diagnose you via internet I will say you are describing the classic  Fever coughing weakness and general misery are the hallmarks of influenza Unfortunately at day 4 its too late to get the antiviral flu treatment On the plus side if this is a case of the flu the fever should go away over the next 24 hours or so If your fever continues beyond the 4th day you should seek medical attention as soon as possible as this could be a sign of something serious going on To your question The maximum daily dose of as set by the US Food and Drug Administration FDA is 1200mg per day You will have to check the label of your bottle to see how many milligrams of ibuprofen are contained in each gelcap youre taking Divide 1200mg by the amount in one capsule to find how many gelcaps you generally can safely take per day You need to be careful not to take any other cough and cold preparations that also contain ibuprofen Even some branded Tylenol products may contain other active ingredients like ibuprofen so read the labels carefully Meanwhile be sure to drink plenty of fluids I hope you feel better soon But if you dont be sure to seek medical attention Im sorry to hear your sons going through this and Im glad he sought medical attention Zpack is the common name for a particular dosing regimen of  which is an antibiotic is the brand name of a combination medication that includes an expectorant which thins and loosens mucus in the airways and a cough suppressant It should be safe to take both the Zpack and the MucinexDM at the same time In telling you this Im assuming your son has no known drug allergies There are no known interactions between azithromycin and the ingredients in Mucinex Best wishes to your son for a speedy recovery Well its impossible to say what has caused your red spots without an examination but I wouldnt jump right to staph So many things can cause flaky red patches on the face including as you pointed out eczema If gentle cleansing and applying skin lotion or cream doesnt help you might get it checked out by a doctor just to be safe This illustrates common adult skin conditions though it doesnt include a picture of a staph infection of the skin I hope the patches clear up soon I know you believe the problem is sinus drainage but has anyone evaluated you for acid reflux I mention this because people especially those with sinus problems often believe they are constantly coughing up nasal drainage when actually theyre coughing up stomach acid You can test this theory yourself by taking an overthecounter antacid for a few days to see if it helps the problem A lot of people arent aware stomach acid can move all the way up the esophagus into the posterior portion of the mouth especially when sleeping Sometimes acid reflux is actually diagnosed by a dentist who notices substantial erosion of the molars caused by stomach acid If the antacid helps or if you can correlate a pattern of phlegm with food intake you might take up the acid reflux idea with your health care provider during your next visit Wishing you well httppregnancyaboutcomodamipregnantamissedperiodhtm this should help out but if I were you Id buy a pregnancy test theres some at the dollar store for 1 They work Common causes of cough include nasal allergy with postnasal drip acid reflux and asthma Do you have nasal congestion sneezing and drip I agree that a trial of antihistamines is helpful You can consider adding on a sinus rinse and talk to your doctor about a nasal steroid spray to help decrease the drainage Do you experience any heartburn symptoms Do you feel short of breath I would let your doctor know if you have persistant cough as additional therapies or investigations may be warranted A cough in a healthy 4 year old can be many things Most commonly colds from viral infections can cause coughs Other causes can be allergies post nasal drip and asthma If your child has had the cough for several weeks it is important to speak to your doctor If he has allergies or asthma that is causing this there are medications available to make him feel better Call your doctor Has he been screened for Pertussis Whooping Cough Absolutely Even if you take the blood clot from last year out of the equation you should seek medical advice from your Doctor It could be something very simple or it could be a serious issue you have going on but the only way to know is if you GO TO THE DOCTOR  Good luck This is most likely a problem within your digestive system either your colon small intestine and all areas that digest your food after it passes through your stomach This is quite dangerous as your food is not being properly digested at all and should be treated by a physican You can start with your PCP but it sounds as if you need to see a gastroenterologist this is an MD that specialize in problems with the stomach and the digestive system Yes Whooping cough can be contracted more than once and if you have been exposed to it you could certainly get it again regardless of the fact that you had it as a child It is not like some of the childhood illnesses you get that gives you immunity from having it again for example like chicken pox you can however get something called shingles if you had chicken pox as a child but in answer to your question you can get it again and having it once does not build up an immunity for getting it again There are many illnessess that you can get that you can get again one example of this is pneumonia If you suspect you have whooping cough seek medical attention immediately This is very serious and requires the immediate attention of a doctor Sleeping in a slightly elevated position will help some You can also ask your doctor to give you a simple device that allows you to excercise your lungs and airway It is a plastic device usually has a small ball in the bottom of it and the goal is to keep using it until you can bring the ball further and further towards the top As you consistently do this it will strengthen your ability to breathe better You are basically exercising your lungs just as you are excercising other parts of your body as you do when you get on your exercise bike As with any exercise program when you first begin you may find with your diminished lung capacity you are not able to do a great deal at first but if you stick with it every day even with the COPD you will have better air way function breathe better and be stronger Let me know after 90 days of doing this several times a day if it helped I believe you will find that you are breathing easier and getting some relief from your morning coughing spells Just remember you have COPD and nothing is going to just make it go away and suddently you are not coughing that is just not being realistic If you stick with it however it should help you and allow you to breathe easier in the am An antibiotic will not help the cough it is only for infection However the cough after an illness is usually the longest symptom you have and can last some time If it becomes worse or prolongs more than a month I would ask the MD Also perhaps they should give him something specific for the cough Coughing is always worse at night and if could mean a better nights rest for him if he can not cough so much at night Also often a cough is actually good for getting rid of the junk that is in his lungs so he needs to cough some of it up and out I wouldnt worry too much at this point The baby may have a cold an ear infection reflux formula intolerance or possibly another condition Its best to have her checked by the pediatrician to see what can be done to help her CALL HER DR Call and ask your Dr your still in your 1st trimester so i wouldnt chance anything Those arent relevant symptoms and 11 days is too soon for a diagnosis of that condition This is a great question But Id like to ask this patient if theyre taking their medicine every day Some allergy medicines need to be in the body consistently so therefore theres a level of the antihistamine in your system and therefore you dont feel the symptoms of whats going on So if the patient isnt taking this medication every day theyre not gonna have the benefit from it And if Allegra isnt working its okay because one of the things that were finding out is that people differ when it comes to medications I may take a tablet and youre gonna take a tablet were gonna have a different reaction to it and some therapies might have to be adjusted and there are other medications available as prescription for allergy symptoms If the physician or healthcare provider decides that maybe they wanna try an overthecounter Claritin or Zyrtec would be probable you know products that could be chosen As a pharmacist I am very hesitant to recommend anything for a child this young Many medications used to treat cough and cold symptoms are too strong for infants and we have to keep in mind that they are not little adults I would need to discuss with you more about the actual symptoms  and in most cases my recommendations are nonmedication ones like running a vaporizer in the babys bedroom and using saline drops and a nasal aspirator for a stuffy nose Talk to your pharmacist  they will be happy to help you So let me get this straight you want to give a 3yearold child adult cold medicine The answer is absolutely not and when I looked at the package it clearly states to not give to children under 12 It is very important to understand that children are not little adults and you have to be very careful when it comes to medication and read the package Have you tried running a vaporizer At this point you can also use some Vicks Baby Rub but that is all that I would recommend until he can be evaluated and seen by a health care provider I would ask a few additional questions around the duration and type of the cough and if you have seen a health care provider previously for the cough In some cases it is not a good idea to suppress a cough as it can lead to infection etc We do not have wellcontrolled studies regarding the use of Vicks VapoRub in pregnancy so I would recommend speaking to your health care provider before using the product Due to the fact that you are pregnant your options are limited I would also like to ask what you mean by sinus infection as a symptom I would also like to know if you went to a health care provider for further evaluation and if you were given any medications You can continue to use the neti pot because that is a saline type of solution and safe for you to use if you have sinus congestion or stuffiness however if your sinuses are draining too much that could be causing your cough I would highly recommend talking to your pharmacist and possibly going to see a health care provider for evaluation The whooping cough shot helps prevent infection caused by a bacteria called Bordetella pertussis The flu shot or nasalspray flu vaccine helps protect against getting seasonal flu caused by certain influenza flu viruses  So yes if you have recently had the whooping cough shot you should also consider getting the flu shot this flu season if you have not had one recently It is recommended that everyone 6 months and older get the flu shot every year Annual flu shots can be given as early as August or September to help protect you from getting the flu during that particular flu season There are certain groups of people who should talk with a doctor before getting a flu shot These include people who are allergic to eggs those who have had a serious reaction to the flu shot previously and those who have had an illness called GuillainBarre Syndrome Check out this article httpwwwsagacoukhealthbodyhowtoavoidacoldaspx It does mention that body temerpature can be a factor Whooping cough also known as pertussis can be spread by contact with contaminated surfaces but this would be rare It is usually spread by contact with droplets in the air coughed out by an infected person Yes There are no dangerous drug interactions between antihistamines for allergies and expectorants for a cough You should always speak with your pharmacist before choosing an overthecounter cold medication They can help you find the best one for your specific symptoms You have to be careful when mixing overthecounter cold medicines As a pharmacist I tend to tell my patients to avoid products that treat multiple symptoms and contain several ingredients When you use these products you often end up taking something for a symptom you do not have Also you may end up taking too much of one type of ingredient if you mix products I do not know what cold medicine you took or if that medicine contained a cough suppressant Therefore I could not tell you if it was OK to use dextromethorphan with it I suggest you take the products to a pharmacist who can review them with you to make sure you do not overdo it Most cough drops do not contain any medication just ingredients that help to soothe a sore throat and quiet a cough from a dry scratchy throat So they are fine to use while pregnant When purchasing the cough drop just show it to your pharmacist to be sure it is one that is safe for you while pregnant because there are many different types of cough drops available There are no dangerous interactions between codeine and acetaminophen or ibuprofen The two can be used together Dimetapp Cold  Allergy contains two ingredients one for runny nose and allergy symptoms brompheniramine and one for congestion phenylephrine Delsym used to quiet dry coughs contains dextromethorphan There are no interactions between these three medications and they can be used safely together if needed You should always talk to your pharmacist to ensure safe use of overthecounter cough and cold products He or she can help you choose the best product for your symptoms and tell you how much is recommended for your child DM refers to one of the ingredients on the cough medicine It stands for dextromethorphan which is a cough suppressant often used to quiet a dry annoying cough No Whooping cough should not be selftreated with overthecounter medications If whooping cough is suspected the person needs to be seen immediately by a physician and receive antibiotic therapy Whooping cough is dangerous especially in infants so it is important to seek medical attention promptly if whooping cough is suspected To provide you with the best advice I would need to know more about your husbands medical history and current symptoms In general decongestants that contain pseudoephedrine would be safe considering his medications As far as the cough goes it would depend on the type of cough he has If it is a loose cough it would be safe for him to use guaifenesin an expectorant to help him bring up the phlegm thats making him cough Guaifenesin would not interact with is medications I suggest you talk to your pharmacist who can collect more specific information from you and make the best recommendation I can tell you that there are no negative drug interactions between dextromethorphan antihistamines and steroid nasal sprays But I cannot tell you at this time if dextromethorphan is the best product to use for your daughters type of cough I suggest you talk with your healthcare professional who will collect more information from you and make a recommendation Could it be allergies Yes It is possible to be allergic to a milkshake or other dessert made from ice cream but not to plain milk You may be reacting to one of the other ingredients found in these desserts other than milk But it is also possible that exposure to the cold is triggering some sort of reaction McDonalds lists the specific ingredients that are used in their desserts on their website Besides milk and ice cream other things that may cause an allergic reaction in some people include peanuts almonds sweeteners preservatives chocolate flavorings wheat and artificial colorings Talk to your doctor about a referral to an allergist Testing may help narrow down the cause of your symptoms In the meantime avoid any food that has caused a reaction in the past  if you have any chest tightness or trouble breathing You are right to be concerned What may have started out as an allergy or even a cold may have turned into something more serious Coughing up mucous can be caused by the post nasal drip of allergies or sinus infection But it can also be from a cold asthma bronchitis or even pneumonia You should seek immediate emergency help with any symptoms of upper back or chest pain Call 911 now  I probably see a Dr about this  Hopefully you have already done so but if not you need to call your doctor right now or call 911 You should not ignore chest pain This needs attention right away Go to your Physician immediately upon suspicion of pneumonia Go to the ER immediately Can I take Mucinex DM while I am taking a Z Pack I would go to the ER and see if they can help you afford it Sorry could be much help but thats what i did when my son had the same thing they had to put tubes in his ears Try giving honey diluted in warm water below 40 C Use 2

he remember what product he was using when this first showed up I think your find his myocarditis was from the pneumonia from what I can read about it Below is some info I have found about his problem and I think this has transgressed from there Chemical pneumonia is an unusual type of lung irritation Pneumonia usually is caused by a bacteria or virus In chemical pneumonia inflammation of lung tissue is from poisons or toxins Only a small percentage of pneumonias are caused by chemicals Many substances can cause chemical pneumonia including liquids gases and small particles such as dust or fumes also called particulate matter Some chemicals only harm the lungs however some toxic materials affect other organs in addition to the lungs and can result in serious organ damage or death Chemical pneumonia is only one type of lung inflammation Other types of lung infections are viral pneumonia and bacterial pneumonia Chemical pneumonia is a type of lung irritation Many substances can cause chemical pneumonia including liquids gasses dust fumes and lung aspiration Symptoms and signs of chemical pneumonia include burning eyes lips mouth throat dry cough nausea abdominal pain chest pain headache and pleuritis Treatment of chemical pneumonia depends on the toxic and amount of exposure Hi for me unless hes the boss then this is his health were talking about time for a new start in another job away from chemicals fumes dust and all the rest that goes with the job working in a body shop If you love your husband like you do then there is no other way he can go he may have a big

thats how this answer started Do hope this helps in some way Good Luck Hi Increased coughing is not a typical effect of caffeine consumption but in some instances it might have that effect The amount

Hi So your saying your heart rate is like half of what it should be Have you got that right If this has been going on for over 3 months then it sounds like something more serious than a cold or sinus infection Could possibly be asthma bronchitis or something else I would go see an otolaryngologist and ask your doctors office to refer you to one they would recommend Its probably best for the child not to stay with you Cat allergies arent fatal but for 4 year old dealing with the symptoms described for several days is not a good idea That also sounds like a lot of medications for a child to be on just so he can be around cats especially when it sounds like its not even working If you cant find the child a more suitable place ot stay then I would keep the cats quarantined to one room and vaccuum all of the carpet and upholstered items in the house to get rid of as much pet dander and cat hair as possible and leave as many windows open as possible to get fresh air inside the house My nephew had a similar problem when he was about that age It helped tremendously in terms of his ability to breathe and reduced the amount that he was getting sick His voice was very deep and husky before the surgery because his adenoids were so swollen After the surgery his voice changed just a bit but not dramatically I would abviously consult with your doctor or ENT first to make sure its not something else though I had a similar problem Gingivitis was partly the cause and my jaw bone has been getting thinner for several years so a dental surgeon was consulted and he took care of my problem Follow up Turn out wasnt liquid in lungs from choking When I was choking my throat spasmed and I think my epiglottis got stuck in an open position My saliva was going down windpipe instead of esophagus and once it built up enough I would cough up the saliva as foam because it had mixed with air in lungs I found this out because I tried to force myself to throw up hoping the act of heaving would force the supposed liquid out of lungs My throat refused to allow any vomit to come up my esophagus no matter how much I tried to force vomit it would not happen I tried taking a sip of water but my throat wouldnt let any liquids go down either I coughed it back up Finally out of desperation I got a mouthful of water and forcefully swallowed when I did I felt a pop in my neck and suddenly the pressure and discomfort I had been feeling was gone No more shortness of breath and no more foam being hacked back up My guess is that the forced swallow somehow popped my epiglottis back into its normal position Immediately felt better and all symptoms I had been suffering for last 45 hours were suddenly gone Rainbow Hospital assess and treat children with more unusual disorders including

with experienced experts at Pediatric otolaryngologistsAudiologistsNurse practitioners If your husband has a fever I am surprised that his blood work came back nominal I would expect to see evidence of inflammation or elevated white blood cell counts He might be dealing with a viral form of bronchitis I went through something similar earlier this summer I had a wet cough that got worse at night for over six weeks If something like this is the case for your husband then a longlasting bronchitis that isnt responding to antibiotics may need other treatment My family doctor prescribed a course of Prednizone to reduce the background of inflammation in my viral bronchitis and allow my system to throw off the bug itself Your husband may wish to talk with his physician about whether a similar approach is appropriate for him as an individual Note although I am well read on some areas of chronic pain literature I am not a physician Regards Red Lawhern PhD Been where you are did that too Talk with your family doctor about a chronic viral bronchitis He or she may prescribe a course of antibiotics possibly followed by a short course of Predizone to reduce the background of upper respiratory irritation and inflammation which has built up Note though technically trained and a patient advocate for people with chronic face pain I am not a physician Red Lawhern PhD Without a fever its possible but you really should be evaluated by your doctor Three months is a long time to be going through this Even when youre sick with a virus or bacterial infection you dont always get a fever  one of the obvious signs youre ill Hope you feel better Youre not getting enough oxygen to your brain This is clearly presenting a problem for you and you really need to be seen by your primary doctor or an emergency room doctor ASAP It sounds like you have a coldflu or possibly bronchitis and the doctor will do an exam and likely an xray to confirm  as well as prescribe some cough syrup with

httpwwwlivestrongcomarticle393502tomatosoupbenefitsixzz2IMlKUA13 httpwwwehowcomfacts5614748signsampsymptomsmoldingestionhtml Im sure this wont come as a shock to you but you need to quit smoking Are you aware that if your lungs get compromised enough you can have a heart attack Coughing can affect your muscles in your chest ribs and back Hopefully youre feeling better by now If not and youve had this cold for a week 10days its time to see your doctor Make sure you drink plenty of fluids to help your body fight off the virus and get you well Take care Well I have tried to look up on line what the 10 or 13 herbs are without success The problem with taking in herbs in general are they are not regulated and many times physicians dont know what the ingredients are Having said that there are not too many products that are found to be harmful to the unborn fetus Plus if you are not feeling well we many times will say it is OK to take different medications during pregnancy Cough drops are one that usually will not cause any specific harm The real question is when did you take the medication How much did you take becuase these all have a say if there is any harm to the fetus In Teratology there are three things you must have in order for the fetus to be harmed 1 The drug must be a known teratogen 2 The dose must be high enough to cause harm 3 The timing must be correct that period of organogenesis Accutane is the perfect drug that we know is harmful even at the human dose It has all three characteristics For you I dont have the exact answer You should ask your physician to investigate The real issue is you will find out soon enough when your baby is born In all likelihood your baby will be just fine Pain in this area especially in a person who has been coughing for a week could indicate a few different things but unfortunately the exact cause could not be determined based solely on symptoms He would need to be examined and perhaps have another chest xray findings can change Basilar pneumonia pneumonia the lower parts of the lungs can cause chest pain Someone who is coughing can have muscle strain of the intercostal between the rib muscles Finally people who cough often swallow a great deal of air When this air is trapped in the large intestines it can migrate upward under the ribs and cause pain due to pressure against the diaphragm There can be other causes of course You are right to be concerned so please see his medical provider again Yes that is possible The vaccine is not 100 protective so if your child has been exposed to whooping cough pertussis or this disease is making a comeback in your geographic area the child should be examined by a health care provider and the proper diagnostic test for pertussis ordered I have no way of blindly diagnosing the cause of your sore throat over the Internetthis is going to take a handson examination and perhaps a Strep test Because you are pregnant you MUST be carefully examined and treated with medications that are safe for you and your baby This may be just a bad cold but you will need to see your medical provider to make sure you do not have something more serious going on You need to involve his medical provider if you are unclear as to the cause of the symptoms or their significance For instance if a child has a history of asthma or pneumonia they need medical intervention sooner than a child who doesnt have this history If your twoyear old had flu vaccine this year he is less likely to get influenza if not he may need to be seen early since influenza can be treated in the first two days So his medical history plays a huge role as well as your comfort in dealing with his fever and cough When in doubt seek medical help Drug store clinics are just fine for this type of medical issue You may have a case of and need some prescription antibioticsteroid ear drops In the meantime a solution of 50 white vinegar acetic acid and 50 water  a few body temperature drops instilled in the problematic ear a few times per day will help Many most in fact causes of bronchitis are viral so the Zpack may have done nothing The prednisone may be helpful for a reactiveallergic cough but this does not cure a virus either Neither medicine nor your disease should have a direct effect on your period so you may need to consult your doctor yet again to take your evaluation and treatment up another notch I have plenty of ideashundreds in fact but an idea is not a definitive diagnosis You need to see a medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated You may need some diagnostic tests like a chest xray to rule out pneumonia or asthma Since I do not know anything about you your medical history or have any way of examining you my best advice is for you to be carefully examined They may be tonsilliths tiny accumulations of food and other debris that get trapped in the cryptsholes in your tonsils and the surrounding tissue They tend to smell andor taste nasty since the warm moist environment of the throat causes this material to decompose This is just a guess however since I have no way of examining you It is time for you to see a medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treatednot something that can be accomplished on WebMD Answers There are many possibilities including Strep and mononucleosis Coughing is not a sideeffect of this antibiotic so it is more likely the cough is being caused by something else Cleocin doesnt taste very good so gagging may be a problem in a twoyear old but not coughing I dont advise you to stop the antibiotic unless specifically advised to do so by the dentist you can always call them or his pediatrician  professionals that know his case I cant answer that since I do not know your diagnosis Your medical provider appears to have treated you for both influenza Did you have a rapid test to confirm it and some sort of bacterial infection requiring antibiotics I just do not know enough about your case to accurately comment on your state of contagiousness so I suggest that you call your medical providerthe person who is treating you This is likely your epiglottis  It should be fine assuming she doesnt fall asleep with one in her mouth and aspirates it Keep taking your antibiotics Assuming it was a ten day course you have six more days to go to complete your treatment If you dont feel you have getting better you will need to be reexamined again As you know you cannot be examined diagnosed or treated over the Internet That would be a reasonable course of action Sinusitis can be a bit tricky to treat and often one course of antibiotics may not do it In light of the fact that you are still having facial pain and pressure and are still congested and coughing you may need further care  perhaps a stronger or different antibiotic assuming you had an antibiotic the first round and something more to control your symptoms We do not recommend Vicks for the babies in our clinic even though our parents used it on us and we survived The ingredients in Vicks has the potential of making a cough worse due to an allergic or irritant response so we dont endorse it And I have to say that Vicks on the feet will only make the feet a bit softer because of the petroleum jelly but it will not cure a cold or calm a cough Please dont tell your mother or grandmother that I told you this A five month old is experiencing our germfilled world for the first time on her own  your maternal immunity will completely wear out by six months even if you are breastfeeding Because they are so darn cute at this age people pick them up touch them and expose them so their cuteness is their own fault She is also teething and drooling so this drainage is contributing to the cough when she is lying down Coughing helps clear her airway and helps prevent the fluid from going in her lungsso it is really a good thing Use a cool mist humidifier suck out the nose I know they hate it and just hang in there Colds last a week or two but she will average 69 of these per year from now onuntil she is about six Each cold makes her a bit stronger so think of these frequent viral episodes as free immunizations No harm but he will still need a polio booster between the ages of 46 No but it does not really help a cough either You will need to see your medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated There can be many different reasons to account for your array of symptoms but unfortunately it would not be possible to narrow them down blindly over the Internet Not likely A toe injury should not cause the systemic symptoms like you are describing You most likely have something else going on perhaps a viral infection in addition to your injured toe There are no rules in medicine that states that a person can only have one issue at a time or that all symptoms must somehow be connected Many coughs can sound the same Now that you have more than just a cough it is important for you to see your medical provider again so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treatednot just for this lingering cough but for your new symptoms Unfortunately I dont know your daughters age or medical history to be able to narrow down the hundreds of possible causes I did have a case once where a child aspirated a small piece of crayon resulting in a severe cough It took a bronchoscopy to find and remove it If your daughter has not had an xray this should be ordered and perhaps it is time to see a pulmonologist lung specialist since her regular medical provider has not found the causereason for this violent cough Decongestants can be used with antihistamines or separatelyas long as the dosgages are appropriate Newer recommendations do not support the use of these types of drugs for children under the age of six unless specifically prescribed and approved by the childs medical provider Decongestants have not proven to be very effective in the management of colds and do not help children with allergies Antihistamines can be helpful for allergies however but again it is best to get the okay from your childs pediatrician because of the age I have no way of blindly diagnosing the reason or significance of your cough over the Internet so I would suggest that you see a medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated Your drowning sensation may be due to fluid or mucous in your lower respiratory tract or even pneumonia so it would be wise to get it checked out today She is coughing for a reason so the first and most important step is to find that reason Does she have asthma bronchitisbronchiolitis pneumonia influenza There are so many reasons There are few if any recommended medicines for cough in children Some are expectorants that cause her to cough probably not something you are interested in but children especially girlsdont ask me why cannot hock up phlegm There are cough suppressants  but these may be contraindicated since the cause of the cough is not known Some people are safely using honey to quiet a cough and certainly a humidifier is helpful My recommendation is for you to have her properly examined While most causes are viral a few are bacterial and require antibiotics Two common reasons for three year olds to have a ongoing cough Undiagnosed asthma and daycare attendance If you have a family history of allergies or asthma asthma should be carefully investigated Constant runny noses can trigger a cough as well If your child is in daycare preschool or going to play groups she is constantly exposed this time of year to backtoback viral infections This alone can mimic asthma and cause a chronic cough An accurate diagnosis is not made by symptoms alone Without knowing your medical history and have the ability to examine you firsthand there is really no way that a medical professional could determine what you have I am sorry but you will need to seek proper medical care You did not ask a particular question but I can comment Any person who been coughing for a month needs to be examined to determine the reason Since you are also having nauseavomiting which may or may not be related this is another reason for you to see a medical provider so you can be properly diagnosed and treated  two things that cannot be done blindly over the Internet Not just teens any male The exam is conducted while the patient is standing The cough or bear down request is important so that the examining finger in the inguinal canal can feel a possible hernia bulging down Dark yellow phlegm could be a sign of an infection or at least stagnation of mucous in your nose sinuses or lungs The fact that it is foultasting is another sign of a possible infection The color of mucous is not as important is the entire package of symptoms that you may be experiencing so if this continues you may need to see a medical evaluation In the meantime drink plenty of water this will thin your mucous humidify the air humidifier or a hot steamy shower and consider trying a decongestant during the day If the underlying cause is a cold viral then you should be improving in a few days If you are having sinus pain sore throat chest pain or fever then it would not be prudent to wait it out California is now in the midst of a pertussis whooping cough epidemic  the worst outbreak in the last 50 years At last count there were 1337 cases up from 258 cases during the same period last year So far there have been five deaths all in Latino infants under the age of three months Traditionally Latino children have had the highest rates among all ethnic groups The pertussis vaccine is given as part of the DTaP to infants at ages 2 months four months and six months so children are not considered fully immunized until after six months of age that is assuming the parents have them done at all Here lies the problem those infants most likely were exposed to pertussis by adults namely unimmunized adults There has been a slow increase in the number of cases since the 1980s thought to be attributed to the decline in vaccination rates as more and more parents opt out or delay vaccinating their kids Over the last few years we have seen multiple pockets of pertussis show up on college campuses but now these random cases are showing up in the general population Other states like Michigan and Arizona have reported more pertussis cases California seems to be the leader once again Pertussis may be following the words of our Terminator governor Ill be back With the exception of smallpox which has been officially eradicated in the wild on this planet all other vaccinepreventable diseases are still alive and kicking whether you hear about them or not The US border is relatively porous and infectious diseases tend to cross with impunity It only takes one case to start an epidemic in a population that is not immunized or naturally immune I saw a set of threemonthold twin girls on Monday accompanied by their proud mother and highlysuspicious grandmother They had already informed the office that they would not be getting vaccines The grandmother was certainly the leader of this movement She was calling the shots Her first issue was mercury thimerosal preservative that is in vaccines I informed her that there is NO thimerosal in any of the vaccines that the twins would need Then comes my ol favorite autism I informed Grandma that there is absolutely no scientific evidence that vaccinesANY vaccineis the underlying cause of autism no matter what she has read on the Internet or heard from someone Finally there was the issue of multiple vaccines given at the same time as a possible cause of autism Again I explained to Grandma that this relationship has been carefully vindicated as well Basically we dont know precisely what causes autism per se but we are pretty darn sure what DOESNT cause autismnamely the vaccines Grandma then said that the twins can get two vaccines today as long as they were not combination vaccines I informed her that we only have combination vaccines They do not manufacture individual vaccines anymore When I asked her which ones she asked me to choose I informed her that all of the vaccines are important so I do not want to choose the vaccines or the diseases that the twins may get if they are not vaccinated I am not going to call the shots so I spent a considerable amount of time discussing each vaccine the recent epidemic of pertussis and the risks versus benefits Grandma finally selected a vaccine combination that contained FIVE different vaccines and another combination vaccine that covered 13 strains of pneumococcusso much for concern over combinations The other two vaccines that were needed were scheduled for a month later Grandma was happy and those twins received the most important of the scheduled vaccines Controversies over vaccines will continue fired by fear and misinformation Vaccines have saved more lives on this planet than perhaps any public health effort other than safe drinking water I would never want to return to those terrible prevaccination days While it is understandable that todays Internetsavvy parents have not seen most of these disease history will indeed repeat itself if we do not vaccinate our population History does not lie If you love your parents and grandparents please know that many are alive due to vaccinations Of course you would not be here In a freesociety you have choices You can choose not to wear seatbelts You can smoke You can take a stance and not vaccinate your kids Statistically since most of our population is vaccinated your kids will probably be fineto a point They will be fine until they encounter someone who will inadvertently transmit a killer pathogen to them They will then fight for their lives and you as the decisionmaker will question the wisdom of your decision Shingles can have systemic whole body effects like fatigue headache malaiseetc but it would be uncommon for shingles to directly cause a sore throat nasal congestion and coughing My guess and it is only a guess is that your symptoms are coincidental There are no rules in medicine that state a person can only have one health issueproblem at time or that all current symptoms are related to just one cause An area of inflammation in the throat or nasopharynx can mimic a foreign body sensation but pieces of food or even a hard lump of mucous can do this as well You may not be able to see a source on a selfexamination but your medical provider may be able to answer this question by examining you It would not be wise to selfdiagnose yourself as having a secondary bacterial infection from your recent viral illness and selfprescribed ampicillin It would be advisable for you to be properly examined and diagnosed first by a medical professional Ampicillin is not used very much any more so it is unlikely that even if you did have a bacterial infection this would not be the antibiotic of choice Signs of secondary bacterial infection such as pneumonia as a result of a respiratory virus would be a high fever a worsening cough with expectoration of dark phlegm chest discomfort rapid respiration and lethargy A mild sore throat or runny nose does not necessarily indicate a need for ampicillin Absolutely Recurrent pneumonia is quite common I would strongly suggest that you followup with your regular medical provider until you are completely well and the coughing has stopped They can be used together but this homepathic cough medicine is really not designed to STOP a cough and may not even help Seven month olds are very vulnerable to colds now that their maternal immunity has worn off and they are also teething Use a cold mist humidifiersuck out any mucous in the nose with a bulb syringe even if they hate itand use saline nasal spray The average child gets between 69 colds every year so you will get use to them It is not the strongest antibiotic for kids but it is effective for bacterial sinusitis Bacterial sinusitis is uncommon in two year olds since most of their sinuses are immature and undeveloped at this age Statistically most of these toddler sinus infections are VIRAL and viruses as you probably know will not respond to ANY antibiotic no matter how strong Bacterial sinusitis assuming this is what your two year old actually has can be tricky to treat often requiring longer antibiotic courses or a different type of antibiotic Failure to respond in seven days may necessitate a reevaluation of this treatment regime Just because he still has thick or colored mucous does not mean that a the antibiotic is not helping or b the cause is bacterial and not viral Viral infections can cause stagnation of mucous and that alone can result in thick greenyellow mucous You cant really use snot color as a diagnostic clue no matter what your mother told you You are coughing for a reason Coughing helps clear your airway of mucous so if you are still coughing then perhaps you are still having postnasal drainage Coughing can irritate the respiratory track so the more that you cough the more that you may feel the need to cough Assuming that you are not having signs of a secondary infection like pneumonia fever chills rapid respiration or an asthmareaction wheezing shortness of breath etc you can quiet an annoying coldrelated cough several ways Hydrate drink plenty of fluids Humidify use a cool mist humidifer or at least take a steamy shower before bedtime Soothe Try some honey to coat your throat Suppress You can take an overthecounter cough suppressant that contains dextramethorophan DM A pharmacist can help you select a good one Try some cough drops Many contain soothing glycerine to help the irritated throat Dont leave them in your mouth at bedtime however Control postnasal drainage An antihistamine may help dry up a drip Avoid decongestants at bedtime they increase postnasal drainage Any persistent cough should be taken seriously so you may need to see a medical professional if the cough does not quiet down and completely resolve See a medical provider so that you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated You may not know the reasons you are crying and not feeling well but a medical provider would likely have more insight This complicated matter cannot be solved blindly over the Internet so please do the right thing and see a medical professional No The drainage from the sinuses is quickly contaminated from nasal mouth and throat germs so you cannot diagnose sinusitis by this method Sinusitis is typically diagnosed by an array of characteristic symptoms sinus pressure pain coupled with corresponding examination findings tenderness decreased light with transillumination  shining a bright light into the sinus area in a darkened room or by xray or CT scan findings Most cases of sinusitis are viral and will be selflimiting but some require antibiotics or allergy mangement See your medical provider Albuterol is a bronchodilator used typically for asthma and a reactive airway If the cause of your wifes cough is due to asthma or an allergic disorder then yes it may help Albuterol is not a cough suppressant however Knowing the CAUSE of the cough is always important when determining how to treat it A cough due to a cold very common is from postnasal drainage so the cough is beneficial since it helps clear the airway A cough due to allergies can be very irritation so an antihistamine may help Suppressing a cough is considered controversial but often helpful if the cough interferes with sleep A teaspoon or two of honey can help or if you are looking for an overthecounter suppressant one containing dextromethorophan DM is often helpful A cough can also be a sign of a lung infection so if any cough persists especially one that is accompanied by chest pain fever or productive of thick mucous should be carefully evaluated by a medical provider Have her drink lots of water and humidify the air she breathes a cool mist humidifierall of these things will help quiet a cough Migraines are vascular headaches and not all headaches are migraines Migraine does not mean a severe headache it is just one type of over a hundred different kinds of headaches The type of headache you may be describing is one of the more common typesa muscletension headache but the pain under the breast is not a typical symptom Muscletension headache can certainly come from the neck Since you cannot be blindly diagnosed over the Internet I would suggest that you see your medical provider for a proper examination Yes You should be concerned Bubbling or gurgling sounds in the chest from coughing could be rales a sign of pneumonia There can be other causes as well Since you are also having fever it would be prudent to see your medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated I dont know since I cannot SEE this rash Sorry You would need to take this child to see a medical provider so he can be properly examined diagnosed and treated if necessary Kindergarten is the cause of your daughters frequent colds coupled by her questionable personal hygiene and social commitments to her many friends The average child gets 69 viral infections mostly colds per year and most are in the winter months When children are plunged into a new environment with new kids they get new germs There are over 200 different viruses that cause the common cold so until she pays her duesand gets enough colds to build her immunity she will be be catching her share and bringing them home to her family In most cases your daughter doesnt have a mysterious weak immune system All she has is overexposure to children her same age all with the same questionable hygiene The play togethertouch each other and everything else and they are taught to share Germs are freely shared She will improve over time but you are going to see un upswing of illnesses after the holidays because her colleagues are traveling to different locations where they will pick up even newer and morealien bugs and bring them back to kindergarten to shareagain Hang in there Medical providers can do little to prevent cold and nothing to cure them All we can do is treat symptoms watch for complications and wait them out If the cough is caused by postnasal drainage from your sinusitis you can try taking a long acting antihistamine Claritin or Zyrtec to dry up some of the drainage Cough can also be triggered by simple irriation so a teaspoonful of honey or glycerinebased cough drops may help Drink plenty of fluids and humidify the air you breathe at night humidifier or vaporizer If all fails you can try an OTC cough suppressant like Delsym or ask your medical provider for a prescription cough medication primarily at night Yes a baby of three months of age with a fevercough should be carefully examinedeither at the ER or by his pediatrician Babies and toddlers cannot hock a loogiethey can cough to the point of vomiting and that will bring it up or they can naturally swallow it While children are not big fans of having their nose suctioned doing so will reduce their cough You can use a bulb syringe or buy a new little device called the Snotarator look it up on the Internet Expectorants or decongestants should not be used by babies so basically there are medicines Use saline nasal spray or drops to reduce the viscosity make mucous thinner and run a coolmist humidifer in the room This is the best you can do since some of the coughing is from accidentally aspirating their own saliva teething and there is nothing you can do about drooling either Your baby either has a cold viral infection or is teethingor BOTH Babies often have a difficult time dealing with drainage either saliva or mucous when they are lying flat so a cough is important to clear their airway Coughing can certainly be a sign of something more serious bronchiolitis RSV pneumonia etc because your baby is immunocompromised due to age so it would be best to have a medical provider listen to those little lungs There is very little you can do at this age to control a cough but you can make it easier for them to swallow excess mucous by using a cool mist humidifier in the room and sucking out nasal mucous using a special bulb syringe A drop of saline in each nostril just prior to aspirating it will help loosen any thick mucous Assuming they go outside in the yard to do their business having them vaccinated is a good idea We have had rabid skunks in our fenced yard in the past so I am glad my three dogs are immunized I take them to the Vet the groomers and to the dog park where they can be exposed to other animals who may not be immunized so again I am glad that I spend a few extra dollars to protect my best friends None It is not recommended that you give any cough expectorant or suppressant to a child under age one Coughing helps clear their airway of mucous While this may be annoying to both of you coughing is beneficial to prevent pneumonia I cannot diagnose your child blindly over the Internet but if the cough persists you will need to have himher examined You can do mucous management however  saline nasal sprays nasal aspiration and using a cool mist humidifier in the childs room You can start with his primary care provider but a PULMONOLOGIST is the lung specialist that he may eventually need to see There are many many different causes of a cough so see the primary care provider first I dont believe there would be any contraindication to getting a pertussis vaccine as an adult but run it by your medical provider  someone who knows you and your complete medical history I dont think that four year old should be using albuterol or Pulmicort from a siblings prescription unless it was specifically prescribed by a medical professional Coughs due to cold are not the same a a reactive airway requiring a potent bronchiodilator or steroid The cough due to a cold is simply the way the body clears the airway of irritating mucous  it does NOT need albuterol Just because the four year old asks for an inhaler in no way implies she needs itfour year old know very little about pulmonology They are really soliciting attention so the cough should be addressed in a safer wayperhaps with a teaspoonful of honeyNOT albuterol Noyou can drink milk and eat cottage cheese It will have no effect on your cough or your prognosis Many people believe that milk products CAUSE phlegmit does not Most sore throats are viral and do not require antibiotics at all The only sore throats that need treated are the ones that are Strep proven by a lab test A persistent sore throat can be due to allergy mononucleosis postnasal drainage from a sinus infection or just from congestion where you are mouthbreathing Since I cannot examine you over the Internet you will need to consult or see your medical provider again for another examinationlooking for other causes Yes there are safe ways to control a cough Remember that coughs are normalthey help clear the airway of fluid or mucous so you dont really want to stop a cough but it would be nice to control it so you and your child can get some restful sleep There are some new studies that promote honey as an effective cough suppressant The type of honey isnt important but a teaspoonful or so when the need arises can make a big difference Humidity is important as well especially if the sleeping environment tends to be dry Use a cool mist humidifier in the room it doesnt need to be blowing in his face He should stay wellhydrated Overthecounter cough suppressants containing dextromethorophan DM like Delsym can be used safely in children over four years of age This one lasts 12hours enough for both of you to have a quieter night You are a parent You dont need me to tell you to worry or not Worrying come naturally Her maternal immunity wore off about a month ago so she is now quite vulnerable to colds viral infections Because she is so dang cute at this age many people are playing with her so exposure to germs are a sure thing She will need to get several colds in order to jumpstart her own immune systems so get used to them This first winter can be the Cold of the Month Club If she is in daycare frequent colds will be a part of your life Coughing can also be triggered by saliva I suspect she is teething When he lies down the saliva or any postnasal drainage has no where to go but down her throat Coughing clears her airways so in some respects it is a good thing If she is showing signs of illness fever rapid breathing wheezing failure to improve over time etc she will need to be examined by her medical provider There will be the sound of coughing in your Christmas videso this year The name of the overthecounter or prescription cough medicine would have been helpfulthere are hundreds of different types I would suggest that you call your friendly neighborhood pharmacist for advice That would be a difficult question to answer without the ability to examine you Cold and influenza are viruses and tend to cause similar symptoms Influenza tends to be worse usually with a fever response not just hot or cold flashes Influenza is a respiratory viruses some abdominal symptoms are not typical in adults kids with flu can get them though If I had to take a guess I would say that you most likely have a nasty viral infection but not necessarily influenza The only way to be sure is to have a rapid flu test If you have been ill for less than two days antiviral medications like Tamiflu can be used There is really nothing that can be done for a cold other than symptom control Treating the SYMPTOMS of colds and flu is often the only thing that can be done trying to feel better while Nature orchestrates the cure Both colds and flu last about a week with the first 34 days being the worst Gatorade is primarily water so really any liquid is fine to help thin mucous Water is cheaper less sugar Tea is fine I will never understand that rationale of giving antibiotics to anyone that has a VIRAL infection This is not good medicine Most cases of tonillitis are viral and antibiotics are absolutely worthless and sometimes even harmful With that said First I assume you are a healthy adult Most adults have relatively good immune systems that fight off viral and bacterial exposures 247 While the organisms may be capable of causing disease the organism has to find a susceptible host Most of the time we just fight off those alien bugs If you dont have tonsils you cant get tonsillitis but you can get a viral infection but it does not mean it will be identical to your son who has a different immune system You may just get a stuffy nose or nothing at all In your case you did get an upper respiratory infection but it didnt have to come from your son It could have been someone else and an entired different bug There are over 200 respiratory viruses capable of causing colds I get exposed to Strep a dozen times a week and have never got it thanks to my own immune system and perhaps better handwashing and other precautions Trust your immune system In most cases you will be just fine The cold that you most likely have now will likely improve in a few days on its own According to the American Academy of Pediatrics you should avoid using ANY cough and cold medications in children under the age of six some even state age 12 Cold medications are only for symptom control They are not very effective and medication sideeffects are common It is important for you to know what EACH ingredient does so you do not have unintentional complications I dont use them in my pediatric practice Unfortunately I do not know the age of your daughter to know if it is safe There are two types of cough medication expectorants that MAKE you cough and suppressants that quiet a cough I suspect that you would want a nighttime suppressant Medications containing dextromethoraphan are considered the most effective overthecounter suppressants as long as they are not in combination with decongestants and expectorants Honey is a good cough suppressant too No side effects and the kids love it Remember that a cough is there for a reason  to clear the airway of mucous and keep it out of the lungs It is okay to suppress a cough temporarily at night so a child can rest but leave it alone during the day Whooping cough pertussis can be a very serious even lifethreatening infection If you are having breathing difficulties it is important for you to contact your medical provider for patientspecific advice Ask you OB about Mucinex since there are many types and combinations Diphenhydramine IS the generic name for Benadryl Your OB can provide you will a list of safe medications you can take during your pregnancy Antihistamines like diphenhydramineBenadryl will NOT open up a stuffy nose They are used to DRY a drippy nose Try nasal saline sprays and a humidifier Colds are not the only thing that can cause a stuffy nose when you are pregnantthose raging hormones can also cause coldlike stuffiness That would be a PEDIATRIC GASTOENTEROLOGIST but many pediatricians are quite skilled in managing this common disorder I dont know anything about your girlfriend nor the type of puffers she is taking but it is clear from your posting that she needs to see a medical provider so she can be properly examined diagnosed and treated  three things that cannot be accomplished blindly over the Internet Whooping cough pertussis can be laboratory proven by an lab testand so can Strep It is possible to develop both since they are two different organisms I trust that you are under the care of a good medical provider who has properly tested you examined you and have you under appropriate treatment These are not things you should selfdiagnose or treat at home There are medications that can help but you need to be carefully examined by your gynecologist or a urologist first There are many causes of urinary incontinence and a few types can be surgical corrected Most infections in the sinuses are VIRAL and not bacterial so penicillin would not likely help in this case I do not know that how you were diagnosed with Strep Unless you had a lab test to confirm it you may not have Strep at all A visual diagnosis is wrong about half the time No it will not work or help the cold symptoms It will just make his feet smell like Vicks Dont tell your mother or grandmother that I told you this but Vicks on the feet is absolutely worthless A fever is the bodys NATURAL WAY of fighting an infection A fever does not need to be broken or even treated especially a lowgrade fever like 1013 I see children every day with fevers in the 104105 rangeno problemsno brain damageand no need to really treat them unless you do so clearly for comfort Did you know that cool baths can actually INCREASE the fever When the thermal sensors on the skin detect that the child is cold the brain will respond and attempt to increase body heat Fever is good and should not be feared With that said the cause of the fever cannot be determined unless the child has a proper medical examination A hospital ER is really not the best place and you will likely waitand waitand wait until you are seen since mildlyill people go the back of the line Go to an urgent care facility if you want or you can just wait it out Please spend some time and reeducate yourself about the medical benefits of fever in childrenI can assure you that it is quite different than what you mother or grandmother taught you to believe Cough medications suppressants or expectorants are for SYMPTOM control They will not help you get better sooner but they could help you feel better while Nature orchestrates the cure One can control postnasal drainage by using an antihistamine but I do not know anything about you or your medical history to know if this would be recommended for you since the underlying CAUSE has not been determined The brownish mucous is a a concern and could indicate a sinus infection so it would be wise for you to see your medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated Yes you can get a tdap There are a few types of pink eye conjunctivitis When you also have a cough and congestion the pink eye may be caused by the same cold virus Bacterial conjunctivitis often has heavy purulent drainage viruses not so much Both types are contagious so keep those hands washed If prescribed eye antibiotic drops they should be used until the infection is goine Yes It should not be a problem There are not egg or nut substances in this vaccine Most cases of bronchitis are VIRAL and do not need antibiotics so this could be one reason why you are not getting better as fast as you though It is okay to take amoxicillin with ibuprofen If you have failed to get better on your doctors treatment regime you need to go back and be reexamined otherwise he will just assume you are better Inform him otherwise Yesthis antibiotic is compatible with Delsym Yes those medications are compatible but Mucinex DM may not quiet his cough as much as you think The DM part is dextromethorophan which is a cough suppressant but the mucousthinning aspect of the Mucinex may cause more drainage thus triggering more coughing This doesnt happen to everyone but in some people it does Taking a pure cough suppressant just at night will help him but when you have pneumonia you need to cough periodically to clear your airway If he was properly diagnosed he should be feeling fine soon You dont have to break a fever in children Fever is beneficial and is helping him fight off an infection A fever of 103 does not cause harm Dehydration is a different issue so it is important for him to drink fluids As long as he has tears and his mouth is moist inside he is probably doing fine Fevers from viral infections for instance can last 34 days The reason to seek medical care would be the cough Simple colds viral infections can definitely cause a fever and cough but so can influenza and pneumonia If you are concerned that this illness is something more than a viral infection then you would need to have him properly examined by a medical professional While you dont have to worry about fever or even treat it you do need to make him comfortable so if ibuprofen or acetaminophen makes him feel better then use it Maybe Yellowgreen mucous is not a definitive sign of a bacterial infection in a two year old but it could be This color change is usually caused by stagnation of the flow of mucous just the way a pond turns green if there is not a good in and out flow of water Two year olds do not blow their noses If your child is ILL or feverishif he seems to be getting progressively worsethen yes seeing his medical provider would be a wise decision The incubation for a viral URI can be as short as 12 hours to a day or more assuming the person that you are exposed to is in the contagious period and shedding viruses usually a day before you know you are ill and about two days afterwards You need to see your medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated  three essential components that cannot be done over the Internet Influenza is contagious a day before you know you have it and about two days later estimate Tamiful is given for five days and must be given in the first two days of an influenza infection so you are about a week into this illness at least That is assuming you were accurately diagnosed I do not believe that you would be contagious at this point Besides your oneyear old grandson should have been immunized for influenzait is offered at age six months When it comes to ANY medication  over the counter or prescription  you need to call your obstetricians office for patientspecific advice and recommendations I can assure you that they have had this question before While many OBs have prescribed codeinecontaining cough suppressants others will not use them Honey is a good cough suppressant tooand considered safe if storebought and purified The real question might be the underlying reason for your coughthat maybe something you should investigate before treating it I guess that would be neurologically possible but I cant say this would be a common response to a cold Because of nerve pathways and the tendency for upper respiratory viral infections to cause inflammation in the nose throat sinuses and lungs one might feel responses in the teeth For instance pain in the molar area can be felt in the ears pain and pressure in the sinuses can be felt in the upper teeth There are two types of cough medicines expectorants that cause you to cough and suppressants that quiet a cough I am assuming you desire a suppressant and something overthecounter so one with dextromethorphan like Delsym would probably be the most helpful The two medications are compatible but many clinicians do not use antihistamines in children who have ear infections since this can thicken the middle ear fluid and make it more difficult to clear in some not all children You may be having exerciseinducted bronchospasm You will need to see your medical provider so you can be properly examined and diagnosed Viruses with the exception of MONO mononucleosis do not last six weeks Just because a cause has not been found does not mean your doctor should give up looking Did he check your thyroid Did he do a mono test Liver function tests Blood culture Are you depressed or under stress There are more things that can be done so until you are feeling better Jenny your doctor needs to continue your diagnostic workup or send you to a specialist There are no viruses or bacteria that only cause bronchitis Any of the hundreds of respiratory organisms can do Most cases nearly all of bronchitis in children I dont know your daughters age are viral and do not require antibiotics ear infections often do not require them either but antibiotics have remained the mainstay of treatment Ear infections are not contagious Respiratory viruses are considered most contagious a day before you get sick and for about two days afterwards Since it has been a week your daughter is not likely contagious even if she still has some residual symptoms like a cough Colds can set the stage for secondary bacterial infections so yesit would be wise to see your medical provider to be examined diagnosed and treated Colds last a week so when someone tells me that they are a getting worse after a week and b coughing blood there is a clear indication to seek some handson medical care  It is common to have mild adverse reactions to vaccinations I would consult your doctor if they persist To add to the question yes he uses a dust mask at work however the fumes and dust do not get completely caught by the mask In 2004 he was hospitalized due to a combination of pneumonia and working in the body shop Basically the pneumonia didnt get better and developed into myocarditis and he wound up in the heart unit at the local hospital over Christmas It all started with a cough much like the one he has now He was put on all kinds of antibiotics for bronchitis and pneumonia but none of them seemed to work and he was put on an inhaler at one point which made his heart race and eventually led to me taking him to the ER at 4 in the morning on Christmas Eve where we were told he was having a heart attack at the ripe old age of 28 Later it was discovered that it was not a heart attack but myocarditis We are trying to get to a specialist sooner rather than later on this and find out if he is just allergic to the chemicals in the paintprimer that is used and if so what can be done about that A change in careers isnt really an option so we need to find some answers at this point All suggestions are appreciated Thanks Is it possible that I never even had an infection and therefore did not require antibiotics So its possible that something else is wrong then You should go back to your doctor because there are quite a number of reasons why your symptoms may have not be alleviated such as the cause of your sinus infection may have not been bacterial rather viral therefore antibiotics were futile to the infection and so on You may be eating certain things that could cause this Spicy or hot foods are more likely all the time going to give you heart burn  and BBQ such as meats and sauces Although this may be something more serious  Possibly may be Heart Disease or a sign of a Heart Attack Please consult your Physcian for a correct diagnosis as I am not the most smartest person in the world Really very sorry to hear what you and your child is going through at this age I will say do follow what your doctor has said For more information on many other inhalers you can visit PharmacySell To help with future coldsupper respiratory I would highly suggest start taking a Prebiotic and Probiotic DAILY Its helped me tremendously and there has been recent medical articles supporting this Hello about 3 yrs ago I started to get weak then started to get tired all the time Also I started having chills like the flu So I went to my doctor and he sent me directly to the emergency room They said after I got seen that I had Pneumonia hopefully you dont have it Had to stay in hosptital a wk sounds like a typical cold or cough take zinc to knock out the little bugs that make ya feel icky Whooping cough is a bacterial infection thats highly contagious and its also vaccine preventable Especially in young kids and unvaccinated people it causes a severe cough which is the reason for the name whooping cough Vaccinated people can still get whooping cough though it may be less severe and the typical whoop may be absent Whooping cough can be a prolonged illness and it may take many months for the cough to go away completely For this reason in China its known as the 100 day cough Its caused by bacteria called Bordetella pertussis It starts like a cold with congestion and upper respiratory symptoms After a week or so a cough develops The cough worsens over several days and the coughing fits may be so severe that you cant stop or catch your breath A coughing fit may be followed by a whoop as the person gasps to catch their breath Its these coughing fits called paroxysms which cause doctors to be worried about pertussis and try to confirm the diagnosis In people who have been vaccinated or who have had pertussis before the symptoms may be nonspecific Pertussis is high on the list if that whoop is present but if its absent pertussis may go unrecognized Its important to know that infants with pertussis dont always cough In young babies the first sign of pertussis may be difficulty breathing or pauses in breathing that last more than 20 seconds called apnea Apnea is serious and requires immediate medical attention Whooping cough spreads from person to person through close contact with oral secretions or respiratory droplets So its easily spread through the cough especially when people are in close contact like living in the same house with a person who has whooping cough It can also be spread through sneezes  anything that spreads respiratory secretions The highest risk is in infants and theyre also at greatest risk for complications if they develop the disease In fact most of the pertussis deaths in the country each year are in infants less than 6 months of age most often in those too young to have received their first vaccination Although pertussis is most dangerous for infants people of any age can get the infection and may cough for weeks or months Its a bacterial infection so it can be treated with antibiotics usually erythromycin or similar antibiotics If antibiotics are recommended its important to take all the doses as prescribed Overthecounter cough medicines are not recommended and dont really help The prescription medicines that are effective for cough are strong and theyre generally avoided in young children and are probably not effective for pertussis Its commonly recommended to minimize the things that can trigger the cough With younger kids try to keep them quiet and limit their activity A humidifier is often used as breathing moist air can soothe the airways Infants with severe disease require hospitalization sometimes in intensive care It can be serious enough to require intubation and ventilation  in which a breathing tube is inserted into the throat both to protect the airways and to assist with breathing until they can recover from the infection Complications of whooping cough usually result from the cough itself such as rib fractures ruptured blood vessels or inability to eat or sleep Hospitalization or severe disease is rare in people older than 1 year But in infants whooping cough can be life threatening Pneumonia and other lung complications can develop and young infants with pertussis may require intensive care including respirators to assist their breathing Whooping cough is commonly thought of as sort of an oldtime disease of childhood that went away with vaccination but it never really went away Vaccination is the best way to protect yourself and your family Learn about 3 ways vaccines can protect babies in particular in this simple infographic from CDC Protect Babies from Whooping Cough  Infants too young to be vaccinated are at highest risk for disease and severe complications In this case everyone around them who helps care for them should be vaccinated Pregnant moms are recommended Tdap during every pregnancy to protect themselves and to pass protective antibodies to their babies For kids pertussis vaccination starts at 2 months with additional doses at 4 months and 6 months They get the pertussis vaccine with diphtheria and tetanus and often combined with other childhood vaccines A booster is required at 15 through 18 months and another booster at 4 through 6 years before they start school The Tdap vaccine is recommended for all adolescents preferably at age 11 or 12 Anyone who hasnt gotten it at age 11 or 12 should get a dose If adults have never had Tdap they should get a dose at any time regardless of when they got their last tetanus and diphtheria Td booster Adolescents and adults need a dose of Tdap even if they were vaccinated as children or have had a pertussis infection  Pertussis incidence cycles with peaks in disease occurring every 3 years or so On top of the usual cycles the overall incidence of disease has been increasing since the 1980s In 2012 we are seeing large community outbreaks and almost every state is reporting an increase in disease There are a number of reasons why reported cases of whooping cough are increasing including increased awareness and diagnosis improvements in diagnostic tests and better reporting On top of that there is increasing evidence that phasing out whole cell pertussis vaccines during the 1990s and replacing them with acellular vaccines may be contributing While acellular vaccines are safer they may not protect for as long Whatever the reasons given the recent increases in pertussis in the US its very important that everyone be vaccinated against pertussis according to the recommended schedule Sounds like you have a sinus or chest cold If the blood is just thin streaks then I dont think theres much to worry about Nothing that a round of antibiotics wouldnt cure And if you smoke STOP If if more than streaky blood in your sputum mucusflem SEEK medical attention immediately These could be signs of a more serious condition This sounds like to me a bad case of GERD Have your family practitioner check you out Extreme coughing can bruise the ribs and will cause tenderness in the rib area Yes if you are coughing heavily I had the same problem about two to three months ago Has your primary care provider suggested allergy testing I have a friend who would cough so hard that he passed out They did allergy screening found out he was allergic to molds pollens and dander and started him on allergy shots Have you had a repeat chest xray Are you running a fever When you cough are you bring up anything If so does it have color This information would be helpful for your primary care provider as well My other suggestion would be to ask for a pulmonologist referral I hope you get some relief soon Here is some information on that I hope will be helpful Making an appointment and visiting your doctor is the only way to know for sure whats causing your persistent cough and get the appropriate treatment We wish you the best The WebMD Answers Staff  and are viral infections Colds tend to run their course in 7  10 days but it can take a little longer Flu generally is at its worst for the first 3 or 4 days but can take up to two weeks to ease up completely Please click into the linked information and read about it If more than 10 days go by and you still see no relief or your symptoms are getting worse then you should call your doctor He or she may want to see you in their office again or try another form of treatment If youre considering taking antibiotics that were prescribed for something else please dont do that without consulting your doctor We hope you feel better soon The WebMD Answers Staff My oldest son got the flu and ran a fever of 1027 accompanied with some vomiting My youngest son started running a fever about a day after my oldest stopped showing symptoms My youngest 9 never got a fever past 1007 but was just as achy with some nausea We treated him for the flu also It lasted no longer than 2 daysfever and the coughing stayed for right at a week They both recovered at about the same rate This could be what is happening Fever reducers would help but only slightly and didnt last but 30 mins to an hour We got Tamiflu from the doctor for my oldest but used over the counter for my youngest and it seemed to work just as good I hope this helps and hope they feel better soon to be honest eat a hobinero pepper it will clear it right up i do it and have my 4 year old do it possible dehydration I would say yes go to the er get checked out It could be just a pulled muscle or any number of things also depends what you did before pain started My wife and I made a picture book for our Autisic son going through similar situation Basically reassuring that mom or dad were definetly going to be back to get him After we made the book we explained all the pages to him and helped him understand what each page meant to him he has had no troubles since Good luck hopefully its not another ear infection and hopefully this will be helpful to you no no its better to stick with one You could be dehydrated or it could be a problem with your appendix pain began after i sneezed hard while in a uncomfortable position If you have insurance you need to have your doctor order a MRI Insurance needs to approve these due to how expensive MRIs are You may have a herniation a slipped disc or it could just be muscle spasm If over the counter pain relievers do not help you may need a painkiller or a muscle relaxer If you have no insurance go to the ER and get help There are emergency payment aids for people with no insurance I hope this helped I just saw the second half of your post sorry Go to the ER If you have no insurance there are emergency payment aids that would cost you nothing You may not get an MRI done but it sounds to me like muscle spasms Good news is that muscle relaxers are cheap Bad news is they will make you sleepy and no way you should drink on them if youre a drinker If its not spasms start asking around for good doctors who will work with your insurance situation You will make a lot of calls before you find the right one but dont give up Theyre out there I promise Have you hurt yourself recently That is where your spleen is If it sticks out and is sore it is probably swollen  if it isnt an injury you may want to get some blood tests done as it is a common symptom of several diseases If you have had a severe cough that alone can do it But better safe than sorry Oh sweetie please dont think the worst It could be an assortment of things including cysts or noncancerous tumors  even an infected ingrown hair But the only way to know for sure is go to a doctor If it is that small no matter what it is it may not be a problem as it would be simple to remove Just dont let it grow before doing anything about it Sorry for the confusion WebMD does not give you a lot of room to write when you start off and I was having problems adding more \tIt you decide to buy some meds try taking one for a day or two and see what happens One should have an indication of infection by the color of the mucus ie clearwhite to yellow to green Green being a sign of probable sinusbronchial infection it sounds like an ovarian cyst that ruptured It happens everytime a women ovulates and it can cause your side to hurt as well In some cases it could be pcos But most likely not Hope this helps If the mucus  from your nose  is dark yellow or greenish  you have a bacterial sinus infection  see an ENT for evaluation I had it for quite awhile before being diagnosed  ugh Good luck Yes They just might not taste as well Have you seen a rheumatoid dr for testing It sounds like fibromyalgia which I have Mornings are the worst for me There are several reasons First of all are you producing sputum If yes the anitbiotics dont work for you This can happen because of resistance and the only way of knowing is by doing a throat swab and culture If you have no sputum production You may either have some amount of postnasal drip  which gives an irritant cough This is treated using an over the counter cold med plus a decongesant The other possibility is that of a post infectious cough which can last upto 8 weeks if not treated with steroid nasal spray which requires a prescription Please see your doctor if you have cough for a total of 3 weeks talk to the ICU doctors Sounds like your dads heart isnt pumping blood forward leading to a back pressure that causes fluid to accumulate in the lung Bipap delivers oxygen at high pressure to help your dad breathe It is likely that IF your dad requires it for more that 2 to 3 days you may be faced with the decision of whether to intubate him or not Supporting his breathing will help him support him while his heart is trying to recover I am a dental hygienist and my advice to you is to see your dentist because it sounds like you may have a problem with the temporomandibular joint Most people refer to this as TMJ Dentists are very highly trained in the detection of all oral disease and head and neck disorders Do you frequently wake up with a headache in the morning This is another sign I hope you find out what the problem is and follow up with your Dr spoonful of honeyor contact ur childs doctor well aspiration pneumonia needs to be taken seriously i had it when i was 4 and a local hospital told me it was symptoms from a surgery i had well i went to a better hospital they told me i could have died if i would have listened to the other hospital Take her back to her allergist as soon as you can I dont know if her Dr prescribed the Zyrtec but there are other medicines that can control the other symptoms  And be sure to be following the advice of the allergist It may be something else triggering her allergies or asthma My daughter takes Nasonex along with Oceans nasal spray and Asmenex Twist Inhaler for breathing then also Loratidineand those seem to do the trick for her But shes never been given Zyrtec Hope this helps seems to be a sinus infection maybe contact doctor about it if it persists I have been sick for three months started with a sinus infection to bronchitis and Asthma i still have mucous in the back of my throatI feel like this is going to be forever I have been to the doctors eight or nine times already They just keep telling me it takes time As long as they see me getting a little better each time Hope it doesnt last too much longer for you no could be just pulled mucles but could also be cracked ribs I am interested in this What did they say or do that made U think they would not see your daughter Why did they say they would not see her Tell us the rest of the story Steroids have lowered my immune system and I have caught colds in the past while taking them Also I rarely get sick at all My answer to you would be yes I can only suggest a netty pot and saline rinse a few times a day My children fortunately do not have the same issues as your son but I have found the Nyquil or Nyquil related products make them very hyper apparently Nyquil has some ingredient in the same family as codeine and the hyperness can be a codeine raction This was told to me by a nurse and seems to have held true Also check with your Pediatrician or other health cre provider about Tylenol My children have been given Tylenol products but do not seem to benefit from them These products never gave them any fever relief It was recommended to us we alternate Advil and Motrin for fevers BUT AGAIN BE SURE TO CHECK WITH YOUR HEALTHCARE PROVIDER BECAUSE OF HIS OTHER ISSUES I thought strep throat was very contagous for 48 hours without medication Have u had a chest xrayIf not u shouldI have had pluresy twice which is fluid arround the lungsit is uncomfortable and can not be cured just has to run its course But having a chest xray would rule out fluid in the lungs also Yes if needed and this shouldnt keep you from living your life Please check out this website You more than likely have an ear infection but it is hard to tell from online I would recommend seeing your doctor who will give you medication and have you feeling better in no time hope this helps Allergies or sinusitis I do know the top number is how fast the blood is going into your heart and the bottom number is the pressure on your heart between beats I was on bp meds because my bottom number got so high problem wsupportive tissue infection I saw a video clip from dr Oz show last night It says for dry cough to use an suppresantdextromethrophan and for a wet cough to use expectorant guaifenesin I do not have ASD but I myself am a severe asthmatic I am constantly congested and cant cough properly enough to get out the phlegm I find I can get it part way out but not without help Here is a trick I use daily to help me cough out all of my goo It is temporarily uncomfortable due to the physical nature of this treatment and not a cure but I found it to help me enormously Try laying her face down on the floor put a pillow beneath her pelvistummy so her chest is leaning down towards her face Cup your hand and pat her back with some force as you are trying to loosen mucus but not enough to hurt her Keep patting her back even as she coughs which I promise she will i suggest a rag or bucket for fluid that will be coughed out Pat in rotation around the back It may take 15 minutes of vigorous patting but it will help loosen the mucus in her chest so that she is more able to get it out even without a proper cough Its like you doing the hard part of phlegm removal for her Make sure she spits out everything that is coughed up I personally get the best results when the patting is done after exposure to steam easily done by turning on the shower as hot as possible and allowing the bathroom to become a sauna of sorts sit in as long as she can Also just a thoughttry limiting milk It causes mucus to thicken thus making even harder to cough out I hope it helps best of luck the antibiotic would be working by now despite not being the full 10 days yetmay be pneumonia which can get very bad very fasturgent care would be a good idea i did this once and it burnt the inner lower lobes of my lungs causing me to also contract pnuemonia with the weakening of the lung how bad is the injury It takes alot of time to get fluid out of the lungs so its hard to determine when the fluid is completely out of the lungs Yes she probably does have bronchitis but since she has asthma she probably has asthmatic bronchitis It could be viral instead of bacterial Were his symptoms different when he had the Xray If it was bacterrial generally the Complete blood count would show high White blood cells Has he had any cultures taken Marieh9 I would go back to the the doctor and make sure that it is not bacterial They can do a respiratory culture If it is viral it wil pass If it bacterial it could be resistant to the antibiotic prescribed Marieh9 yes You need to have his levels checked The medication his is on can be toxic and needs to be checked regularly Other symptoms of the toxic levels can be change in behavior confusion and return of his unmedicated schizophrenia behaviors ive been pregnant twice and i had bronchitis with each pregnancy no it wont cause harm to the baby just see your doctor for antibiotics get well whether it is normal i cant say but i do and do so often consider yourself lucky what you described doesnt sound like a herniated disc sharp burning pains throbbing all day and that is the best thing i can say about that sorry i soulnt help more It is more than likely due to your cold and not a major cause for concern Use ear drops and see if that clears things up if the symptom persists or worsens see your doctor is she wheezing or is her chest rumbling is there still blood in her mucus when she sneezes if any of these questions are a yes i highly recommend taking her to the DR ASAP IVE HAD THIS PROBLEM SEVERAL TIMES AND WAS DISCOVERED TO FIND THAT I WAS ANEMIC THERE IS MEDS YOU CAN TAKE TO HELP it does take time if your coughing it up thats a good thing your bodies breaking it down and getting it out just take it day by day  i know how u feel i had one too and it got worse cause i hated the idea of staying stuffed and unable to breath  so i always blew my nose and it made it so much worse  youll be fine in to time  hope this helps For our infant 4mo daughter it started like a pretty normal cough 5 days later the cough had only gotten worse It went from one or two of the infant double cough pairs up to runs of 6 or 8 double cough pairs lasting more like ten seconds We took her to a walkin clinic for a persussis swab that day but she stopped breathing that night and turned blue We called the ambulance and it was a close call but still its quite crazy how quickly it escalated It sounds to me like you may have GERD or acid reflux Ive never had heart burn but I do have GERD It started with a bad taste in the back of my throat and a nasty tasting cough I could also feel it in my sinuses The acid from your stomach can affect your voice as well Look up GERD here on WebMD It seems like you have quite a few of the symptoms Good Luck My best guess would be that the first time you had your cholesterol checked you you were not fasting By plates I assume you mean platlets and those could have been higher because you werent feeling well The second time you had these done you were probably fasting or hadnt eaten very much and were feeling a bit better Just try it It worked for my kids Rub on feet and put on socks and within a 1020 minutes the cough will lessen Also marshamallow root is good for cough  chest congestion It sells in extract form Have you had your grandson looked at by an ENTPediatrician It almost sounds like Larygomalacia Big scary word but is almost always benign I am not a DR but have experienced this first hand with my granddaughters It was almost always when they were on bottle and if they did get colds they tended to get noisier My youngest gdot was the worst but the ENT assured my daughter and us that she would outgrow it just as her sister did I know there are many other causes but this sounds so similar Otherwise healthy kid just a bit of a concerning noise Next Ped appt Id be sure to ask the Dr about it just to be sure Good luck and enjoy the little one  Hi Ive got 5 children 5 grandchildren and 2 ggrandchildreni hate to say this but if thats the worst she gets into her mouth youll be a very lucky parent It sure isnt recommended but look at it this way I assume shes still in diapers and taking a bottle andor baby food Everything she eats is cleaneverything that comes out will be too  now when she gets older and starts to walk and explorethats when you should know what shes into Trust me if my mother had known what i got into on my grandparents farm at 3 yrs she would have keeled over dead Kids are like cats they have 9 lives in spite of us  Stay in touch with your doctor and overlook his apparent lackofconcernremember he deals with dozens of kids and their new parents everyday Sometimes they forget Poor dental health bleeding gums or not maintaining oral hygiene have known to cause strokes The bacteria from the mouth gets into the blood stream and also reaches the heart leading to strokes A number of researches have proved this fact There are no drug interactions between the two medications and are safe to take together But if your ever concerned about giving medications together regardless of what you find online always contact your doctor may need to see Chiropractor mine does at times and one day Ill deep breath and pops on its on Have you been tested for Ashma or Bronchitissounds like thats what might be going on beens you have had the cough for such a long time Or even have test for TB or Emphazema better safe that sorry right Best of luck to you I am a nurse with 4 other medical degrees so I cant diagnos you but I am leaning toward Bronchitis Could be related to acid reflux The acid cause travel up the esophogus and cause problems like hicup cough and make your esophogus squeeze or spasm and because that same thing happens to meis very painful You probably need to go see a Gastroenterologist who will nee to do a upper GI scope to see what is going on He will probably write a prescription for something like Belledonnageneric which is also an antiseizure med but has multiple uses and have you comeback every 3 months to see how you are doing and if you need another upper GI scope It can Pleurisy is an irritation of the pleura The sack covering the lungs and the inner rib wall My Doc says it is like filling the area with sand Doesnt seem to me personally like anything to worry about but you never can be to safe No youre fine Probably just pregnant those brown spots are probably the nicotine that has got into your body and its probably going to be like that until you stop smoking and if you do stop smoking and your spit still looks like that then ask your doctor about it you should probably go see a doctor and make sure you take a sample of that with you so that the doctor can check that outadn if he cant help you then i dont know what you could do I had pain for over a decade Hard getting out of bed and going to bed Cold weather and dampness increases it My PCP recommended I move to Floridawarmer climate Sounds great but really UghhhhDoctors didnt know what else to do with me Jokingly I replied just take me out to the pasture and shoot me I felt helpless I felt no one believed me Very frustrating Been thru so many tests lots of xrays blood work etc The most reliable test would be an MRI and nerve conduction tests Not happy with the dx but I have Fibromyalgiasomething that is not easily detected or believed by med providers It is something I have to deal with for the rest of my life All one can do is take it one day at a time Always thank the Lord for another day I wish you well God bless you and yours Hello I am not a doctor but i can help a bit You did not specify as to whether or not you had protected or unprotected vaginal sex Protected vaginal sex puts you at a low risk where as unprotected vaginal sex puts you at a high risk of contracting HIV There are no clinical symptoms associated with HIV This means that no consistent physical symptoms have been observed among people with HIV With that being said some infected individuals do experience a strong flulike illness 23 weeks post exposure and this last for about 810 days However some infected individuals experience no symptoms at all The World Health Organization guidelines consider all testing to be conclusive at 3 months So make sure to get tested after 4 weeks Its possible the only way to know if the mold in the cup is making him sick by getting him tested for it I would tell the pediatrician about the mold and that the treatments dont seem to be helping Keep the cup to show the doc but no longer use it for you child How long has he been on treatments if more than a week i would definitely take him back to the doctor his symptoms were exactly the same then as they are nowjust no real improvement since being on the antibiotic My father also have this problem but exercise make him feels good I guess exercise will help you out And to clear up the cough do pursed lip exercise Thank you No it is not you could pass the virus on to other people Can be allergies sinus infection or who knows There is something called an expectorant which can be bought overthecounter which helps to break up the congestion and eliminate it from the bodyusually in spitting out phlegm balls gross want to suggest u Baby Sleep Aids A common cold or bronchitis most likely Go to your doctor and get antibiotics if it doesnt clear up I would be taking him to the doctor and letting a him listen to his lungs When I have had bronchitis I feel like I spent the night in a smoky bar or smoked an entire pack of cigarrettes I would see a doctor about your symptoms  You might recall where the mouse droppings were You may have been in contact with fiberglassthe microscopic glass can easily affect sinus and lung linings Try taking a really cold bathit will tighten your skin poresand try Advil Cold and Sinus to clear the sinuses Im surprised your ENT didnt order you to get a CT scan I had a swollen lymph node in my neck for several months and I was eventually diagnosed with lymphoma not necessary consult doctor immediately "}
