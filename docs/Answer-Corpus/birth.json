get pregnant if you take oral contraception While birth control pills are an effective method for preventing pregnancy its very dependent on routine use If taken exactly as directed the failure rates are extremely low and theyre 99 effective at preventing pregnancy In reality women need to take the pill daily and at nearly the same time of day in order for this method to result in these percentages More and more studies have shown higher pregnancy rates with oral contraception One recent study quoted numbers as high as 20 times greater risk of unplanned pregnancy than other forms of birth control Yes you are at risk for pregnancy Changing contraceptives is a change of hormones and all birthcontrol works differently So while mirena may have worked by physically blocking sperm and thickening cervical mucous and hindering reproduction that way this new birth control may need time for the hormones to get into your blood stream Test for pregnancy when you get the chance and proceed from there I see this everyday in my practice and its a real problem This is a condition thats most likely called Melasma We used to only see it in pregnant women but what happens now is that when women take the pill and the longer they take the pill so its almost any contraceptive whether its a patch or a pill that contains hormones the longer you are on that and then when you combine that with even minimal sun exposure can cause a patchy discoloration usually symmetric on the cheeks or upper lip and even on the forehead This gets darker in the summer often fades in the winter but on the upper lip especially can look like a mustache and women just hate this So its important to understand the underlying cause its hormones and sun exposure either from being on the pill or just your own natural hormones or during pregnancy Then the other part is the sun that you really have to protect against When I say protect I dont mean if you are going to the beach If you are just going to walk on the street get your newspaper from the corner go to the bus stop you have to have adequate protection on Wear a hat if you can try to stay in the shade when you can This condition can be treated but it can often be difficult to treat What we use are things like hydroquinones or ingredients that have Sepiwhite or mulberry root extract or liquorice extract those are ingredients you can look for on products and as dermatologists we can also do treatments in the office There are certain chemical peels that we can do that can help target that pigment in a very specific way and help lighten it But if you go in the sun it will come right back For many women even if their periods are regular you need some type of hormonal balance in order to help control the acne I have patients who tell me that they never had acne as a teenager now they are in their 20s 30s and sometimes even 40s and all of a sudden they are starting to get acne and invariably this acne is in the lower face Not the teenage form where its in the middle face and forehead but really along the jawline and the lower face and even along the submental along the neck and the jawline underneath a little bit as well This acne can be very difficult to control with the treatments that we use in teenagers So I still use antibiotics by mouth and topical treatments such as the retinoids RetinA and Tazorac benzoyl peroxide things like that But when I add an oral contraceptive or another medicine called Spironolactone or Aldactone thats the same drug in the brand and generic name that often works really well to control their acne and make anything else I do work that much better But it does need to be under the supervision of your dermatologist Youre right that you should still be fully protected against pregnancy since you doubled up on a pill instead of skipping it Id recommend you continue the pack as usual and then start the new pack a day early In other words just continue as if you didnt take the extra pill Hope this helps Im sorry but its impossible to answer your question without knowing the specific type of birth control pill youre taking Some pills come packaged in a 28day pack and you simply take one pill every day all year round Some pills come in a 21day pack and you should start the new pack 7 days after you finish the last pill in the pack With Seasonale brand pills you take them for 84 consecutive days This WebMD page has information on  But this is such an important topic that you really should consult your pharmacist to ensure you dont accidentally miss a dose which can affect your birth control coverage Best wishes to you Thats a question only your health care provider can answer Id suggest you contact the person who prescribed the birth control pills and ask them about the testosterone therapy Your question illustrates why its so important to provide a thorough health history before leaving any clinic with a prescription in hand Your health care provider needs to know about all the medications overthecounter and prescription and supplements vitamins herbs etc you take before he or she can safely give you any kind of prescription medication  including birth control pills Wishing you all the best My first bit of advice is to you my young man Be sure to use a condom Birth control pills arent nearly as effective if theyre not taken correctly You both may be at risk right now of her being pregnant so if her period doesnt start on time she probably will want to take a home pregnancy test Meanwhile your girlfriend should start the new pack on the correct date as if she hadnt gotten off track She will need to take her pills correctly for at least 30 days in order to be confident she is protected against pregnancy For more information your girlfriend can consult her pharmacist or the medical professional who prescribed the pills Also my general public service announcement Always remember birth control isnt the responsibility of just one person in a relationship Even if the woman takes birth control pills its a good idea for the man to use a condom This helps prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and adds protection against unwanted pregnancy Likewise for girls Even if a guy volunteers to use a condom you need to use some kind of birth control yourself if you want to avoid pregnancy Dont rely on just one method Take care Revolution Abdominal Cuts is a product that is not FDA approved Therefore we do not know much about the truth behind the companys product claims The web site does not list any ingredients which makes it very difficult for me to check whether there is an interaction with birth control pills As a precaution if a complete label of the quantities and ingredients for a product cannot be found and is not provided on the product that product has not been scientifically proven safe or effective by the FDA It depends on the type of pill that you have been taking Most birth control pills are a combination of estrogen and progesterone products The medication itself will be eliminated from the body in about 12 days Factors that can play a role in how open the window is for pregnancy include how long you have been on the pill and how compliant you have been with taking them on a daily basis Most likely the birth Control will prevent you from becoming pregnant I would however not suggest any drinking for the next couple weeks Take a pregnancy test in a couple weeks after your body would have sufficient time to fertilize I wouldnt worry much However even with you being on birth control I would suggest still using a condom just to be safe The risk of pregnancy in using routine antibiotics and birth control pills BCPs is very low In fact antifungals eg ketoconazole or macrolide antibiotics eg erythromycin azythromycin Biaxin actually increased blood levels of estradiolnot decrease them Being late taking some BCPs can also increase the risk of pregnancy but the risk is not large unless you entirely miss for two to three days Unprotected sex on active pills does not increase risk unless you had just completely missed several days of active pills I would urge you to do a reliable pregnancy test For the most accurate answer you can do one test on the first day of your next pack  She would have had perfect protection no condom needed the week she started her new pack given that the first active pill was taken in the new time slot Most birth control pills have anywhere from 27 days of inactiveplacebo pills This does not impact contraceptive protection the ovaries stay suppressed with any of these regimens So a time change when restarting the active pills again should not alter coverage  If there is something that I have not understood correctly eg she takes only the active pills pack after pack then a week of condom use after a late pill is VERY ample hyper safe According to the US Food and Drug Administration FDA generics are copies of brand name drugs that have exactly the same dose intended use side effects route of administration risks safety and strength as the original drug However a generic version may have different colors or inactive ingredients The FDA estimates that 50 of generic drug production occurs in the same plants used to manufacture the brand name drugs Office of Generic Drugs FDA 2009 After a patent expires on a brand BCP a drug company wanting to market a generic version must submit an abbreviated new drug application to the FDA This process is streamlined so that the basic animal and then human studies do not need to be repeated since those studies were done when the brand names ingredientsdoses were being approved FDA 2010 However absorption of the generic compared to the brand name drug is studied After reviewing 2070 of these comparisons it was found that the average difference in absorption was only 35 When considering individual drugs almost 98 of generics had absorptions area under the curve which were less than 10 off from the brand name Davit 2009 It is important to remember that there can also be similar variability between batches of the more expensive brand name drugs FDA 2009 The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists published an opinion statement number 375 Brand versus generic oral contraceptives It supports patient or clinician preference in choice of BCPs as brand and generic are considered medically equal ACOG 2007 No normal multivitamins or iron supplements should not impact birth control pill effectiveness I had the exact same thing happen to me a couple of weeks ago And Im also on birth control for the same reason It is correct to take tomorrows pill if you lose today However I just started my next pack a day early so there was no invisible pill day It doesnt hurt anything What was the CT of her whole body or just the leg Does the numbness occur when she is sitting with her legs crossed laying down on that side or spontaneously Is it long lasting or short lasting Birth control pills regulate when your body ovulates So while youre taking the hormone pills they keep your body from ovulating If you missed 2 pills in a row it is normal to have bleeding because your body assumes its time to have a period since you didnt give it anymore hormone pills If you have any other problems though contact a doctor  From my own personal experience it is definitely possible When I talked to my doctor about it they had me switch pills I still bled up until I decided to use the patch instead Talk to your doctor if you havent already and see what they say Good luck There are no reported interactions between Vyvanse and birth control pills Anytime a woman is experiencing changes in her menstrual cycle she should consult her gynecologist No Overthecounter cold medicines will not affect the effectiveness of birth control pills Yes You can use cold medicines while taking birth control pills There are no interactions to be concerned about Check with your pharmacist to make sure that the medicines you choose are right for you It is possible Any time you change medications you could experience a new side effect However not all new symptoms are caused by medications You would need to have your rash examined by a doctor in order to see if it is simply a drug side effect or if something unrelated to the medication is causing the rash No A regular multivitamin will not affect the absorption of birth control pills There are no drug interactions You should always check with your pharmacist before taking overthecounter medications vitamins or supplements when you use a prescription medication Your pharmacist would be the best person to help you avoid drug interactions Most birth control pills contain a combination of two types of hormones an estrogen and a progestin These work together to stop your bodys production of a hormone that tells your ovaries to release an egg So in fact they primarily work by stopping ovulation from occurring each cycle If there is no egg released there is no egg to fertilize and you prevent pregnancy The hormones in the birth control pills cause other changes that help to prevent pregnancy as well Nevertheless this is their main mechanism of action There is no evidence that Adipex interacts with birth control pills or that it makes you infertile However women on birth control pills are at a higher risk of blood clots that can cause heart attacks and strokes Adipex can raise your heart rate and blood pressure which also increases your risk of blood clots that cause heart attacks and strokes So be sure that the health care professional prescribing your Adipex is aware that you take birth control pills and that heshe can monitor you appropriately You can take a pain reliever such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen while taking birth control pills or penicillin There are no drug interactions between the pain relievers and your prescription medications You should always check with the pharmacist before taking OTC medications when you are using prescription medications Errin is a progestinonly form of birth control commonly referred to as the minipill because it does not contain any estrogen If you start the pack of pills on the first day of your menstrual cycle you can expect them to be effective after 48 hours In the mean time you should use a backup method of contraception such as a condom for the first two days you are taking the pill Also if you forget to take a pill or are more than three hours late in taking it you should use a backup method of contraception for 48 hours While there are no known interactions between this supplement and oral contraceptives I cannot say for sure if it is safe As a pharmacist I never recommend weight loss supplements Many have dangerous side effects such as increased heart rate and blood pressure which could be dangerous for someone on birth control pills and have been found to contain dangerous ingredients These supplements are not regulated the same way as drugs that are approved by the FDA We can never really know for sure what is in these supplements So I cannot tell you with any certainty about the possible interactions Yes Zenchent and Balziva both contain the same ingredients in the same amounts  35 micrograms of ethinyl estradiol and 04 milligrams of norethindrone per tablet Flax seed will not affect how birth control pills work But there are some supplements that should be avoided by women who take birth control pills St Johns wort commonly taken for mood and energy can actually lower the amount of hormones you get from your pills making them less effective which could lead to an unexpected pregnancy It should be avoided Before taking any supplements you should always check with your pharmacist to make sure they do not interact with your prescription medications All of the combination oral contraceptives can cause weight gain The estrogen in them promotes water retention But the weight gain from birth control pills is usually transient and goes away with continued use The amount of weight gain may be decreased with lowerdose versions and with the progestins that are less like testosterone Those that contain desogestrel norgestimate or drospirenone tend not to stimulate the appetite so much Talk to your doctor about which birth control pill is the best one for you It depends on where in your cycle you are and what antibiotic you are taking Not all antibiotics affect birth control pills A general rule of thumb is to use an alternative method of birth control for the course of the antibiotic usage and for seven days after you stop But it really would depend on your individual situation You should talk to your gynecologist or pharmacist about what you should do Azurette and LoEstrin are combination oral contraceptives which means they contain an estrogen and progestin that work together to prevent pregnancy Norethindrone 035mg is a progestinonly form of birth control These forms are generally reserved for women who cannot take estrogens such as women who are breastfeeding Progestinonly forms of birth control are not as effective as combination versions and need to be taken every day with no pillfree days There are no significant interactions between any vitamins and birth control pills You can take a regular multivitamin while taking birth control pills without any problem You are going to finish your active pills a day early So you can decide to start your new pack of pills a day early to stay on the 7day placebo schedule If you choose to skip a day and wait to start the new pack on your regularly scheduled day there is a very slight chance that the one day can make a difference in the risk of an unexpected pregnancy The more pills you miss the more likely you are to get pregnant It is OK to start midcycle But you are not protected from pregnancy until you have taken the pill for at least seven consecutive days It is also likely that the pills may change your cycle You should expect to get your period about three days after you finish the active pills in the pack In the meantime you may notice some breakthrough bleeding or spotting since you started right before your period was supposed to come Talk to your gynecologist if you notice anything new or unusual It depends Some people gain a little weight while on birth control pills But not everyone does You may notice a bit less water retention which would go away rather quickly  most likely in the first week or two after you stop taking the pill But you are not likely to notice a significant drop in your weight simply by stopping the birth control pill Antihistamines and birth control pills are safe to use together There are no dangerous interactions between those classes of medication As long as you are a nonsmoker and in good health not significantly hypertensive not a significant diabetic etc you can take the pill Of course you want to be on a lowdose pill  most women can do well with a pill that has 30 micrograms of ethinyl estradiol or lower So if your pill says that it has 50 micrograms of estrogen check with your healthcare provider about switching to a lower dose if possible Remember women can get pregnant in their 40s  I personally have delivered three women who were 47 I dont know how to edit the post but her doctor had her take the pill right away too Not on her first day of her period or the sunday after Just had her start it in the middle of the week No I didnt I got her Plan B just be safe

helps Good Luck Hi No just stop them now but not forget condoms And see my other answer Good Luck Hi No as this should be your safe week during your normal cycle so as your on BC it gives your body a natural week with out extra hormones As you should know first day of you period of you go again taken your daily pills OK Good Luck Hi If you bottle feed your baby or combine bottle feeding with breastfeeding your first period could start as soon as 56 weeks after you give birth If you fully breastfeed and do not combine bottle feeding with breastfeeding it is possible that your periods may not start again until you stop breastfeeding This is your bodys way of preventing additional pregnancies while you have a small baby Do hope this helps Good Luck Hi This a piece of info I extracted from a piece about two periods a month OK the info come from Ivillage Another reasons for twiceamonth periods is abnormal thickening of the uterine lining This thickening can be due to hormonal imbalance or to taking estrogen without a progesterone medication as well estrogen causes the uterine lining to proliferate and become thick and lush while progesterone thins out the lining a balance between these two hormones is necessary to ensure regular moderate periods So it may not be as easy as I write but if you get a hormone test done from this it would tell you which hormone is out of whack it then would be to get them back on track by adjusting them In my mind it should work try seeing an obstetrician perhaps heshe will understand this and make it work they must have seen it before Do hope this helps you Good Luck Hi These are some of the side effects mild nausea or vomiting appetite or weight changes seems they match up with yours apart from the weight change Hope it helps Good Luck Hi Go see your Gyno heshe should be able to test your hormones and tell you from that or it could be something else Do hope this helps you Good Luck Hi found you some useful info from WebMD should help you Are There Side Effects of Birth Control Pills Yes there are side effects of birth control pills although the majority are not serious Side effects include Nausea Weight gain Sore or swollen breasts Small amounts of blood or spotting between periods Lighter periods Mood changes The following side effects easily remembered by the word ACHES are less common but more serious If you experience any of these contact your doctor immediately If you cannot reach your doctor go to an emergency room or urgent care center for evaluation These symptoms may indicate a serious disorder such as liver disease gallbladder disease stroke blood clots high blood pressure or heart disease They include Abdominal pain stomach pain Chest pain Headaches severe Eye problems blurred vision Swelling or aching in the legs and thighs This could be from the hormones kicking in and just be a side effect Do hope this helps you Good Luck Hi Your in the problem range why because the BC pill can increase the risk of breast cancer I think it would be best if you talk this over with your Doctor or a family planning clinic Hope this helps Good Luck Hi If you have been off them for sometime just dont just stay as healthy as you are now your body will love you for it and so will your bfhusband for not smelling like and old ash tray Good Luck Hi as long as you keep to this list below you should be OK Its from the NHS When taken correctly the pill is over 99 effective at preventing pregnancy This means that fewer than one woman in 100 who use the combined pill as contraception will get pregnant in one year You need to take the pill at the same time every day You could get pregnant if you dont do this or if you miss a pill or vomit or have severe diarrhoea If you have heavy periods or painful periods the combined pill can help Minor side effects include mood swings breast tenderness and headaches There is no evidence that the pill makes women gain weight Theres a very low risk of serious side effects such as blood clots and cervical cancer The combined pill is not suitable for women over 35 who smoke or women with certain medical conditions The pill does not protect against sexually transmitted infections STIs so using a condom as well will help to protect you against STIs Hi What you should do is see your doctor ASAP But do stay on the pill till then Good Luck Hi Just to see if your problem is coming from BC have you tried coming off it for a month just to see what happens Could be that you just need to change brands could be either progesterone or oestrogen thats giving you the problem Do hope this helps Good Luck Hi you have a choice you can either do what your saying or just chuck away the placebo pills and carry on you can if you want do it more than one pack some just keep doing that till you feel you need a period Hope this helps you Good Luck Hi Have had a read up about this for you OK it seems you can do this but and here is the but you should discus this with either your doctor or gyno before you go ahead with doing it So go see what your doctor or gyno says first its best you do it this way Best advice Good Luck If you are having periods off of your birth control pills then you are not yet menopausal You may be perimenopausal which means you are getting close to menopause Menopause is when you have gone 1 year without a period while off of birth control or hormone replacement It is difficult to know when menopause occurs while taking the pill but your doctor can check your hormone levels while on the placebo pills to get an idea if you are menopausal or not Although it would be unlikely that you would get pregnant at the age of 48 it is still possible if you are having periods I recommend that you go see your doctor to discuss the best options for youxmlnamespace prefix  o ns  urnschemasmicrosoftcomofficeoffice opop I went to the doctor and her best explanation was a burst cyst She said I looked fine and even gave me a full examination I have not had that pain again since it happened last month I also have had intercourse after the doctor concluded I was fine and I did not get any pain again Noit should not be a problem Your contraception should still be effective even if you had diarrhea an hour later Noit does not have to be the same time but taking them every morningor eveningwithin a few hours or so is perfectly fine You should be consistent so you dont forget them You are correctjust take the next pill in the pack and so on You may have your period one day early but start the next pack on time Biofeedback for hormonal imbalance Never heard of it Sounds a little strange to me There is no way that anyone will know that you are taking birth control pills unless you choose to tell them or they drop out of your purse and someone sees them Whatever odd biofeedback test for hormonal imbalance that you are having is unlikely to reveal that you or anyone else is taking oral contraceptives Noall birth control pills are hormonal This is how they work There are nonhormonal contraceptive methods like a diaphragm cervical cap and condoms but no pills There are many different types of condoms including nonlatex ones I think your boyfriend should use them so find a brand that is compatible Why Condoms prevent STDs not just pregnancy If your boyfriend strays just one time you will be at risk and the same goes for you You have a fight and break up both of you may be vulnerable to a onenight stand If or when you get back to together either one of you could bring back an unwanted gift of an STD Yes you are probably wellcovered for pregnancy assuming you take your pills correctly but having that extra margin of safety would seem to be worth it I recommend that my birth control patients wait one entire cycle Use a secondary form of birth control like condoms during this brief waiting period If you are not 100 sure of the fidelity of your partner it would be wise to use a condom anyway Birth control pills do not offer any protection against STDs Magnesium supplements should have no adverse effects with hormonal birth control Yesthere are MANY different birth control methods that do not use hormonal control See a gynecologist discuss your medical history and this expert will help you select a method that is right for you Yes Stopping missing those pills If you dont start remembering to take your oral contraceptive on a regular basis and you do not insist that your boyfriend use a condom for extra pregnancy and STD insurance then it will only be a matter of time before you become pregnant Put your birth control pill with your toothbrush so you will remember I am not sure I completely understand your question since the main reason women take birth control is so that can have sex at the same time If you are talking about taking just one pill or your first pill on the same day you had sex this will not be an effective contraceptive As you know sex causes pregnancy IF you are ovulating at the time and your partner is capable of fathering a child A woman on birth control pills really should complete a full cycle one month of the pills plus a period before using it as a contraceptive Using condoms for the first month would offer good insurance There can be many reasons to have a light menstrual period or spotting while on the pill It does not necessarily mean you are pregnant Birth control pills taken properly of course are highly effective so your chance of an unintended pregnancy is not very high Can it happen Yes so if you are having any OTHER signs of pregnancy a home pregnancy test or a visit to your gynecologist would be in something to consider Medications are not like milk that expires but when it comes to birth control pills is it really worth the chance of taking oral contraceptives that have expired EIGHT MONTHS ago Get advice from the pharmacist or your OB but I think you would be better off with new unexpired birth control pills I cant say that I ever counted them Like most clinicians we only pick our favorites There are number brands and even more marketed with generic names httpwomenwebmdcomguidecomparingbirthcontrolpilltypescombinationminipillsmore I usually recommend that my patient complete one full cycle one month of pills before using it for contraception It would be wise to use a secondary form of birth control like condoms for that first month I dont believe that this overthecounter product will have any adverse effecs on your oral contraceptives but there is a good chance that no studies were done to determine adverse effects since this is not a drug Green tea or green coffee bean extract and caffeine are the main ingredients so it is up to you whether to add a secondary birth control method condom or not  If efficacy is your goal  preventing an unintentional pregnancy  it would be wise to use a second form of birth control such as condoms until you complete one full packet of birth control pills have a normal period and then start the next packet Even then condoms will always be an effective second level of insurance No You can take Robitussin while on birth control pills You will be much safer IF you and your boyfriend use condoms 100 of the time Birth control pills should be taken for an entire month followed by a period before relying on it for contraception Use a condom Oh and one more thing Use a condom A complex study published in May 2011 involved about 18000 women and 1330 episodes of contraceptive failure Researchers looked at the data on women both during months of contraceptive success ie not getting pregnant versus contraceptive failure to see if taking antibiotics made any difference The bottom line contraceptive failures did occur but it was no more likely to occur if a woman was taking oral antibiotics Warning it is well known that one particular antibiotic rifampin does definitely change the metabolism of many oral contraceptives The study excluded women on that medication because the interaction of rifampin and contraceptives is well established If youre taking rifampin you must use a second form of birth control Even the best largest studies cant say with 100 certainty that a superrare event cant occur It could be that in very rare cases antibiotics could somehow affect the way oral contraceptives work So if you want to be supersafe using two contraceptives is never a mistake I agree with StewartJames my physician has prescribed Mifepristone 200 mg and Misoprostol 200 mcg to my wife also treated in the same way Source GlobalDiscountDrugs Might be some kind of hormonal imbalance its still important to see your doctor just to make sure You cant actually stop it Your body will do what it wants Try to remember to take your pills to prevent this You can but the only problem is is that pills were designed to allow your period to occur If you do what you are implying then you will mess up your cycle and will never be able to tell if you are pregnant Its really a guessing game if you attempt what you are implying So in simpler terms dont do anything that your doctor has not told you This is referred to as drug misusedrug abuse And it can have some serious consequences unintended pregnancy MTP Kit contains 5 tablets that is one tablet of Mifepristone 200 mg and 4 tablets of Misoprostol 200 mcg  The use of medicines is based on the physical condition of the patient and the drug tolerance power of the patient In general at first one tablet of Mifepristone 200 mg is taken orally by the patient After 13 days 4 tablets of Misoprostol 200 mcg is given to the patient vaginally Sometimes abortion might not occur after the intake of Misoprostol even after 4 hours of its intake In that case a second dose of 2 tablets of Misoprostol 200 mcg is administered either vaginally or orally The mode of administrating Misoprostol depends on the amount of bleeding that usually occur after 25 hours of its intake and can continue for 35 hours Sometimes the bleeding can even stop before 3 hours There might be blood clots that the patient passes from few days to weeks Sources  PharmacyCell dot com If the patient thinks that they have missed the dose then they should consult to their medical advisor Yeah you can get pregnant bcoz you had unprotected sex if you dont want to keep it you can take birth control pills you can buy from chemist shop or online at Melasma is acquired hyperpigmentation of sunexposed areas Common locations are the face cheeks upper lip and chin The exact cause if melasma is unknown it is thought to be a combination female hormonal activity and solar photosensitization which leads to the increase in the production of melanin Therefore your first approach to control melasma should be to avoid direct sunlight especially during peak sunlight hours Your next steps should include a skincare regimen that includes sun block and a combination of chemical peels with natural fruit acids along with skinbrightening agents One might gain weight while being on contraceptives but it cannot be held as a fact that the reason of the weight gain are the contraceptives To demonstrate that the only reason women tend to get bigger while on contraceptives is by being part of an experiment monitoring every eating habits sleep schedule and activity Otherwise all accusations of weight gain being correlated to birth control pills are false httppharmacyreviewsmdforumwomenshealthbirthcontrolwhichbirthcontrolpillsdontcauseweightgain Even when taken correctly oral contraceptives can have a 5 failure rate and women are known to miss a pill now and then Nope You may want to take a pregnancy testif you are not pregnant you should call your doctor with any concerns you have theres always a chance of pregnancy with unprotected sex Given the length of time youve been consistently taking birth control Id say this is highly unlikely It sounds like what youre experiencing is breakthrough bleeding and if youre having your pills changed ie seeing your doctor soon its probably a good thing to mention as well as your fears re pregnancy to your health care provider I think so It can be normal since your body isnt used to the medication yet but there are plenty of different birth controls out there and I would talk to my doctor maybe you need a different pill I have a friend who has PCOS and successfully got many of the symptoms under control including the weight gain and had 2 children The key though is finding the right doctor who will really partner with you on getting it under control thanks for the response we try to be very careful this is the only mishap weve had in 2 yrs and will certainly be the last it was the 7th pill in her pack that she missed and we had sex 5 days later but like I said she took two the next day and I wasnt aware that u might need to use backup shes never missed a pill before so thats why she took plan b around 2426 hrs later on account of I ejaculated in her a little aside from the scare of having a kid I also hope by taking EC it doesnt mess her up to bad I would say no I did it for a while and Herbalife is all natural it should definatly not effect birth control About a week and a half or so But a month for sure depending on the pill a month is always safe Whoever purscribed you the pill should have told you automatically Some times Yes Some times No every persons body reacts differently I wouldnt be worried if you got your period or not If you took the EC pill the next day you are 90 probably fine Talking from experience I have been on birth control for 5 years However for next time be careful because it isnt recommended to use EC as a regular form of birth control Being that she doubled on the pill I believe it is highly recommended to use condoms for the whole month However like I said you shouldnt worry since you took the EC the following day Note the longer you wait to take EC the less effect it had on you No Periods should last no more then 3 7 days even on birth control Please see your Doctor right away Unfortunately your situation is in the middle area based on how long you previously were on the pill Usually just a 24 hour period of not taking the pill will result in reversible effects but you went as long as 60 so the risk is much greater Taking two after will have no effect as it will take at least the first cycle of 28 days to get back on Depending on whether he ejaculated in you should decide whether you need the 72 hour pill Good luck been there a couple times with my gf before and it has always worked but it has the highest chances within the first day so I would jump on that fast and any drug store sells it to 13 and up yes you could be birth control can cause you to get pregnant if you miss a pill or take a pill later than you were suposed to Do not take this lightly I went several years after being diagnosed with PCOS and having MDs tell me to exercise and diet even though I was They looked at me like I was crazy and just flat out lieing to them It took me many many years to find a doctor that actually did some tests which lead to a biopsy which was possitive for cancer Everyone else said I was too young in my early 30s to have any such problem The biopsy results came in on a Friday morning and I had a FULL hysterectomy and oopherectomy the following Monday After I healed from surgery I lost a 50 pounds without doing anything different at all I still continue to loose weight without doing anything extreme I am not a doctor nor do I claim to be able to completely and utterly answer your question but one thing that is likely happening is that your insulin level is increasing This would be one cause of the lack of menstruation youre having Also though birth control makes you sick you may want to try a different type With PCOS there are a lot of hormones that are out of whack Birth control helped me in the past keeping control of my cycle though not all of the time I would speak with a gynecologist or an endocrinologistsp i believe you still can if ur not taking back up I use to be on the depot it works right away Be warned some women bleed for the first 6 months strait It sounds like it most likely related to your ovary on that side It is possible that you may have a cyst that is causing your discomfort It is also possible that it could be your appendix but seeing as how you have had the pain going on for 3 weeks and are otherwise asymptomatic that is unlikely You can have periodic spotting and bleeding while on birth control pills even though its not technically your time You are putting hormones into your body and altering its balance Its happens I would be concerned if this is an ongoing issue for multiple months And for next week you will probably just continue to have your period throughout the week It will most likely be much lighter just wondering if anyone had an answer on this Estrogencontaining contraceptives have been linked to low milk supply and a shorter duration of breastfeeding even when started when baby is older after milk supply is well established Not all mothers who take contraceptives containing estrogen will experience a low milk supply but these unaffected mothers appear to be a very small minority For most mothers progestinonly forms of contraception do not cause problems with milk supply if started after the 6th8th week postpartum and if given at normal doses However there are many reports most anecdotal but nevertheless worth paying attention to that some women do experience supply problems with these pills so if you choose this method you still need to proceed with some caution Progestinonly contraceptives come in several different forms the progestinonly pill POP also called the minipill Micronor Errin NorQD Ovrette Microval etc the birth control injection Depo Provera the progesteronereleasing IUD Mirena Progestasert the birth control implant Norplant Implanon Here is the link for where I got this information from httpkellymomcombfcanibreastfeedmedsbirthcontrol Yes and it depends on the cycle you when you were on the pill and off if u if period was on different cycles when u were take the pill then Going to probably start late or to early but if it never change u should be fine it is possible that you could be pregnant however it takes about a week to two weeks for the birth control to get out of your system if i were you i would take a pregnancy test on or around the first week of February hope this helps it would be unlikely but if your concerned the best thing you can do is take a test whatare the side affects for stopping birth control pillafter 30yrs im now 50i stopped them mth agoi have racing heart sweating fatiguefeeling downis this all because my estrogen levels are low through stopping pillplus if i wasnt on pill my age 50i wouldnt have much estogen leftso is this why my symptoms badHELPPPPPPPPP PLZZ Did you ever get an answer Hi not sure what pill ur using but I would talk to your dr because if you are not used to having cramps this bad and now you are it could be a bad reaction to the pills not sure but either way better safe then sorry talk the dr hope u feel better soon  Since you say you were on BC probably not Condoms are often lubricated with spermicide too which also increases your safety Id say the odds are in your favor that you arent pregnant "}
