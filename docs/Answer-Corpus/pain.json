What you could be experiencing is uterine or vaginal proplapse It would be best to go to your Gyno and explain the symptoms what makes you to not see a doctor after the second month of not having your

If the kidney stone does not pan out I might suggest seeing a chiropractor Your symptoms match what I go thru when my low back goes and I have a hip turned out of place It can affect many things Another indicator would be if you have urinary seepage Something very similar happened to my cousin He was lifting though it gave him pain in the same area But he ended up slipping a disk and pinching a nerve Thats some serious stuff you should probably get checked out I had mono when i was 14 for me the pain lasted about two weeks then went away It sounds like it could be a mild form of staff I had something similar and my doctor gave me pills But another doctor told me to take a bath in plain water and a cap of bleach and after about a week it went away Please read my post before responding As stated in my post I have been to the doctor In fact I have been to two doctors I was referred to a urologist but the urologist is not available until the end of January The two doctors I have seen do not think it is anything to be concerned about however I am still bleeding rather heavily I am hoping someone will be able to give me some advice about what the possible causes might be or what I should ask to be checked for when I see my doctor again it might be an ullser you have pilonidal disease What is pilonidal disease sourcehttpwwwwebmdcomskinproblemsandtreatmentstcpilonidaldiseasetopicoverview im a 36 year old male i have horrible pain in my right leg and the pain ever so often the pain would change and every time it changed it would be worse got it in late october of 2009 i have gone to every specilist i went and saw a pain management and was on very high pain medicaton and all that i still hurt but the meds gave very little help and my right leg mainly the foot and ankle would be like 6 degrees colder than my left leg and my right foot would be very red like a sunburn almost gave up hope that i would never have answer then i thought i would try one more dr he said that i have RSD or CRPS i was told that there narcodics wont help it will only get worse and there is no cure for it and if you can try to find a really good dr and ask could this be RSDCRPS for me it started with numbness then it would just burn then needles sticking me and then like large nails sticking me and all though that it would still be throb and the ouside of my foot i could set my foot in the hottest of water and couldnt feel it but the inside i felt all this pain you may want to go online here and ask what are the symptoms of RSDCRPS it is caused from an injury or trama to limb of the body and it can spread to other limbs I wish you the best of luck finding out what it is take care and best wishes i dont beleave there is a narcotic pain pill that wont supress ur cough sinus infection sounds like u have the flu or cold and sinus an infection both  Prednisone can cause thrush in the mouth which will look like sores You should contact your doctor right away to make sure it is not an allergic reaction either I cant say for certain that its not a DVT but it sounds like its bursitis or a bone spur Basically the slippers your wearing have no real padding and when you walk the forceful pressure with no proper cushion can cause the tendonsligaments to strain and tug at the bursae fluid filled sacs that act as shock absorbers for the tendons  this then causes them to become inflamed and painful Ive had this before and its because I was wearing flats and Im a heavy girl Its remedied by wearing shoes with actual cushion or at least buying insoles for the flats if you refuse to switch lol but be careful Sometimes this makes your shoes fit differently and you may need to go up a half size Thats honestly hard to answer I am going to SPECULATE and say its a muscle or tendon or ligament there that may have been damagedtorn during the accident I think this because of how you said it feels soft at first then hard throughout the day and then can be massaged away If you only tore part of a tendonligamentmuscle it would knot up like you mentioned I recommend telling your physician the next time you go to the doctor because if my theory is correct you risk further injuring the area Better to fix it NOW than wait till youre crippled right Unfortunately most sinus infections are viral and just have to run their course Antibiotics just put you at risk for many other problems take my advice yeast infections and cdiff are not fun and arent helpful for viral infections Unfortunately from what i remember from my own personal experience viral tends to hang on longer and seem more severe Drink lots of water and keep up with the ibuprofen Everyone recommended a netty pot when I was sick Never tried it but my nursing friends swear by it You may have an impacted bowel You need to consult a health care professional right away  IDENTICAL SYMPTOMS appeared in my ankle preceding a bite from a Black Widow spider in the topIfoot The actual bite she gave was ABSOLUTELY PAINLESS Was the head removed Thinkdid the front of the tick between its front legs have a drop of bloodliguid visible after removal Was the tick at all actively flailing its legstrying to move As opposed to a piece of you attached to it resembling a small blood blot and a highly active tick IF RECENTLY ATTACHED I WAS TAKING PILLS BUT NOW DISCONTINUE BUT IT STOPS MY PERIODS ALTHOUGH I M NOT PREGNANT HOW TO GET PERIODS AGAIN Based on my personal experience the person having such complaints faces frequent urination due to the blockage made by the stone and is never satisfied The urinary bladder fills again  again in intervals due to stone blockage Has he seen a doctor and if so has the doctor sent him to see a rheumatoid doctor as his problem could be some thing else and not arthritis The amount of time between periods can vary It isnt exactly once a month sometimes it can have a lot of delay and other times it can come earlier than expected The blood flow is heavier on some days than it is on others Sometimes there is a heavy blood flow the next day theres hardly and blood and the day after that the flow could be heavy again Also the vagina tends to bleed less when the period is almost over The stomach pains you felt were most likely ovary cramps which are normal They can start before your period actually occurs Drinking lots of water and placing a hot water bottle on your lower abdomen can help soothe these pains Pls go to your dr and check for appendicitis My son had this Sounds like a UTI urinary tract infection even if its not this you should see your doctor Good Luck see your General Practitioner they can help advise you Not sure if you should be concerned but I have had pain in this area and found out from XRay that I have a curved spin So when the pain starts I make sure to stretch my spin from side to side and this helps me quite a bit Good luck Have you gone to your Doctor or a Neurologist I suggest you get an MRI to see what can be going on in there There could be many things Have you had any trauma in the past Have you ever hurt your head If the mark looked like a target it possibly could have been a tick and in that case you would want to get treatment for lyme disease

After four lumbar spine surgeries I have learned quite a bit about your ailment My problems stemmed from a congenital deformity in the lumbar spine but yours could be anything from just a mild sprain soft tissue injury to a bulging or herniated disc Alternating ice and heat may help but if your pain persists or increases seek the help of a qualified spine specialist who will probably order an MRI as it is the most effective way to diagnose the source of your pain If your pain travels to deep in your hipbuttock or down the leg there is probably nerve impingement that can lead to permanent nerve damage if not addressed so it is something that shouldnt be taken lightly The key to having a strong back is having a strong core Keep those stomach muscles toned Good luck I am in my late 50s now but

indigestion So what did you find out Broken 5th metatarsal Night Terrors This causes the child to scream like is in fear Your child is not awake during this You can try to comfort them and it wont help Sometimes waking the child up makes it worse My daughter had them and my doctor told us to not disturb her and it worked better than when we awoke her Usually when they order labs with long term drug use as the reason it is because youre on a medication that has possible side effects  theyre checking for those which they should do For example patients on Amiodarone have their liver function checked annually They arent saying youre using recreationalillegal drugs You can discuss changing her to a methylphenidate medication since these have lower risks of stomach ache Or you could explore Vyvanse which is similar to Adderall but has a different delivery system If you are reluctant to change meds one alternative to discuss with your physician would be to split the Adderall dose  give half the capsule and then 2030 minutes later give the other half If you sprinkle the med into food do not let the second half of the dosage sit in the food for the 30 minutes since the beads will dissolve prematurely continued The floor is a smooth concrete and provides no cushion so every time I step the pain amplifies I bought doctor Scholls work inserts the result was the same no relief Last night I took my old inserts and put them in with the Dr Scholls inserts hoping it would double the padding but still no relief I take extra strength offbrand tylenol when I get to work and about 1am at lunch which helps very little I am willing to pay for a new pair or steel toe work shoes or work boots I am in the military and the cheap boots they give us never hurt me through all the marching standing and working nearly as bad as this does If you have any Idea what kind of steel toe boots or steel toe shoes that would work for me please feel free to post a link to them I would like the price to be 150 or less but willing to go more if they will stop this awful pain I get pains all the time I always thought it was old age I use an enema on the onset of severe pain  it works for me eat more fiber  fruit Drink more water How long pleurisy lasts depends on the cause Pleurisy occurs when there is inflammation in the lining surrounding your lungs The lining consists of two thin sheets pleura When something causes these sheets to become inflamed it can feel as though two pieces of sand paper are rubbing together and sharp pain occurs on both inhaling and exhaling Infections from a virus or bacterium including tuberculosis a blood clot pulmonary embolism trauma cancer collagen vascular diseases such as lupus or unknown idiopathic are common causes of pleurisy Since your doctor has prescribed antibiotics and steroids your diagnosis is probably an infection Once the infection has healed the pleurisy should improve Sometimes scar tissue develops in the pleura and chronic pain can result Talk to your doctor about your continued pain If you have a cough or are a smoker this may be aggravating your problem Pain medications and cough suppressants may be helpful Gabapentin works to relieve pain by altering the way your body senses pain You should notice that your pain from shingles starts to improve over one to two weeks after starting gabapentin but it may take longer in some people However some people feel the benefit straight away Gabapentin is a medication that needs to be gradually increased The usual recommendation for pain from shingles is day 1 one 300 mg pill day 2 one 300 mg pill twice daily day 3 one 300 mg pill three times a day and thereafter working up to 600 mg three times a day Doses above 1800 mg a day have not been shown to have greater benefit Because everyones tolerance to medications varies be sure to discuss your use of gabapentin with your doctor Your very low testosterone level may be the cause of your symptoms Testosterone deficiency causes muscle wasting and weight loss Genetic inheritance plays a role in fewer than 10 of cases of Lou Gehrigs disease as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS is popularly known Testosterone deficiency is not necessarily an indication of of ALS There is some evidence though that babies exposed to high levels of testosterone during pregnancy are more likely to develop ALS later in life Talk to your doctor about treating your low testosterone level and hopefully your muscle mass and weight will improve If you have weakness of your legs or hands slurred speech or trouble swallowing these may be signs of ALS and should be evaluated by your doctor Hi there I have pains like that all the time I went to the emergency room they ran all these test and told me that I have a strong heart  and that they were muscle spasms  and told my to take Tylenol It didnt make any sense to me I dont believe to be muscle spasms so I just went with it I still have them but I just pay them no mind So I recommend just going to get it checked out and see what they tell you It would be good to see a competent orthopedic specialist They have many tests such as xrays CT scans MRIs discograms that can help diagnose your condition Have you checked if has had a fall somewhere or hurt while playing Please do not ignore and take him to a doctor Hope he gets well soon As a mother do understand how traumatising it can be when kids fall ill Take care The pain has been on my left side just about 2 fingers under my rib cage what is causing this pain If you are allergic to cortozone or any of its compounds then yes it could be an allergic reaction The best thing to do is ask his Dr Hi Yellowing of the eyes is a type of jaundice I would make a doctor appointment Hi if you are out of shape I wouldnt worry You will expierence pain in your chest and sides because it is new Hi  I had anxiety  panic attack for over 25 years One of the things that I found that really did help me was to do reality checks I would ask myself questions that I could easily answer  things like  where am I what am I wearing if out  where am I going and what do i wantneed to do Im not sure about the neurololgists you were seeing but my mother is being treated by a combination of neurologist psychiatrist  pain management She does see an endocrinologist because she had thyroid cancer which was removed but she has developed Graves Disease and suffers from Glaucoma and sees an Opthamologist Sounds like many but is not a high price to pay to find a way to successfully treat her without the use of narcotics It is wonderful to see her be able to return to a near normal way of living her life Whether you feel these lumps may be cancerous or common I highly advise you to see your physician and accordingly the doctor may or may not order additional testss However If the lump is painful and can be rolled around chances are it may be a cyst of some kind and can be easily treated I have a personal story I had a horribly painful lump in my armpit and was more than frightened about the diagnosis of cancer I did make an appointment with my physician and after a full examination of the area and an ultrasound it was found that the area was a severely ingrown hair and the area had to be lanced and drained Simple wound care was required for a couple of weeks following the procedure Evidently there is a large percentage of women who shave our underarms incorrectly There is a name for these women They are known as rakers A raker is someone that glides the razor over and around the underarm area in an irratic manner across the direction of hair growth against the direction of hair growth whatever gets the job done and it causes irritation or folliculitis inflammation of the hair follicle and even an ingrown hair which can become extremely sore and enlarged due to the inflammation The correct procedure for shaving your underarms is as follows Start with wetting the underarm area with lukewarm water apply shaving cream specific to the sensitive area of the underarm area and use a great quality razor either disposable or reusable NEVER A DULL RAZOR Always glide the razor WITH the direction of hair growth This is information that you can use all the time especially if those painful underarm lumps are diagnosed as being ingrown underarm hair This is not to replace a visit or an examination by your physician ALWAYS SEE YOUR PHYSICIAN FOR ANY ABNORMALITIES FOUND IN THE BREAST LYMPH NODES OR UNDERARMS THIS CAN NOT BE STRESSED TOO MANY TIMES Gas I have someone in my family who has had a traumatic brain injury He has been on numerous prescriptions since August 2012 given to him by his neurologist Let me also add he was hit by a 90 lb crankshaft that fell from 9 feet in the air off of a pallet The crankshaft landed midway on the leftside of the back of his head neck and back The doctor started him on hydrocodone and this only made matters worse headache wise He was then put on oxycodone which has been a lifesaver Oxycodone helps when nothing else does God bless you and I hope you get to feeling better To be honest my cramps were much less severe and sometimes I never even had cramps while I was on birth control However if you dont truly need birth control I would advise finding another method to control your cramping Think about what birth control is and what it does to your body You are literally swallowing one tiny pill that completely changes the mechanics of your body I dont know for sure what types of negative effects they have truly linked to birth control but it all just seems too much to be necessary I dont take any pills if I do not have to to keep junk out of my body but when my cramps get horrible I have found advil liquigels work much better than midol and the like There are also many natural alternatives that are simply an internet search away May be gout if it is near the joint One possibility In my 20s I had chest pains My doctor asked me about my caffeine intake I drank at least one Pepsi a day at the time plus some tea I cut out the Pepsi and the symptoms went away  This happened to me when I was in elementary school Was playing baseball and slid into homeplate on my butt At first the pain was excruciating and I could not sit straight up putting pressure on my tail bone for a very long time I had to ride in the back seat of our car to get home by lying down on the seat When it did not improve my parents took me to the dr and that is when I found out I had cracked my tail bone and there was nothing they could do for it As time went by and I started having my well woman exams my dr informed me that my tail bone was bent forward and when I get pregnant one day my OBGYN will advise me if that will be a problem It wasnt as I had a CSection but for a different reason It took a while but the pain finally subsided  That was a very embarrising thing to go through but were good now not sure what the answer is but try to roll your foot on an icecold can of pop or the like back and forth gently rolling helped me quite a bit Thank you very much I shall get this check done Male 37  Asian Lived mostly in India temporarily living in the US Prior history of bronchitis attacks during winters but not in the past few years No illness during the last 1 year Nonsmoker with occasional limited alcohol consumption Weight has been steadily between 6062 kgs for a decade and I checked yesterday but there is no change I havent changed my food habits or lifestyle in the recent past Is there any other info that I could provide to help I have slight pain in left testicle kind of comes and goes I know from my own experience with arthritis that your complaint sounds very much like arthritis You should however see a Dr for it as there is a difference between Osteoarthritis and Rhuematoid Arthritis Either way a true Dx should be made  You may be experiencing a phenomenon known a Tactile Hallucinations It is only a guess The name for this disorder is derived from the following two words 1 Tactile is the term used to describe the sense of touch 2 Hallucinations are false sensory perceptions that occur without any supporting environmental stimuli Sensory hallucinations can also involve other senses body senses such as taste and sight and have causes similar to those associated with Tactile Hallucinations Refer to the below links for other WebMd questions that I have answered httpanswerswebmdcomanswers5051457itastesoapwheneverieatordrinkevenwateridonottakemedicationsorsupplements httpanswerswebmdcomanswers5051154whydoismellsmokeandthereisnosmoke Yes Tactile Hallucinations are observed in individuals with emotional conditions such schizophrenia But some serious medical conditions can also be responsible These medical causes may include tumor growths infectious disorders alcohol or drug ingestion epilepsy and others Since I am not a physician I can only speculate on a reasonable cause for your false sensory perceptions Without knowing your age length of time that you have experienced these tactile sensations medications taken and overall medical history it is difficult to make any absolute judgments about your symptom I recommend that you start off in your quest for definitive answers by visiting your family doctor That individual may provide you with a physical exam and order some preliminary diagnostic testing They may also prescribe treatment options and refer you to other medical specialist  There is no need to automatically delay your surgery Your penicillin was prescribed as a preventative safeguard and in itself should have no impact on your upcoming hip surgery As a matter of fact some surgeons begin a preventative infection regimen of antibiotics prior to joint replacement surgery With that said it is critical that you report all medications taken prior to and up to the time of surgery to the anesthesiologist and the surgeon Based upon your particular medical profile theyll be able to make the best decisions concerning the penicillin treatment and its influence on surgery Best wishes for a great surgery outcome and recovery Although I dont known your medical history or possible other symptoms I highly recommend that you seek emergency treatment immediately As a matter of fact please and allow professional medical personnel to assess the cause of your pain You have everything to lose by delaying medical evaluation Anytime that you receive general anesthesia is a time for caution to be exercised There was no available medical studies showing a contraindication to receiving epidural steroidal injections if you have diverticulosis There are some anecdotal accountings by individuals claiming that that they experienced negative GI events following the procedure Some other reported side effects from the epidural injections include the following Fluid retention edema sodium retention I had the epidural injection series completed a number of time in a hospital setting under general anesthesia and never had a problem I had GERD but not diverticulosis Immediately prior to the procedure I was always interviewed by the anesthesiologist or their representative I recommend that you disclose the diverticulosis condition to the treatment team prior to the procedure occurring If your diverticulosis is under control and you just have some discomfort every once in a while the procedure should be safe It may not be the eating that is causing your heart pain but the anorexia One of the symptoms seen in anorexia is irregular heart rhythms It is because you are not eating correctly and not receiving adequate nutrition that your heart hurts The human mind is powerful weapon It sometimes deceives people into thinking thoughts that are not true and are dangerous to your physical and emotional wellbeing The thought process seen with anorexic individuals is that they think that they are fat Those fraudulent thoughts seem very real and require medical and emotional supports to overcome In psychology there is a theory called The Looking Glass Theory and addresses why some people may develop a poor selfimage The theory doesnt restrict itself to just weight issues but may also be applied to goodbad looks intelligentunintelligent etc The theory goes something like this An individual is beautiful but the individual thinks that other people see them as being unattractive therefore the individual sees themselves as being ugly Now switch my example for what you may be thinking about food and its causing you to feel fat Constantly reprogram your mind to think I am not fat people dont see me as being fat therefore Im not fat I hope that my answer has been helpful and doesnt comeoff as too simplistic I realize that overcoming this disease is a big challenge because the delusional thinking seems so real Keep on with your recovery path With proper supports you can regain your physical and emotional health I wish you well  Neurontin Gabapentin has been approved for the treatment of seizure conditions It also is indicated for use in neuropathy Neurontin is legally prescribed by physicians to treat numerous other conditions that have not been officially recognized by the federal government for its usage off label prescribing at the physicians discretion such as back pain restless leg syndrome and even bipolar conditions Years ago I had severe back pain that was nonresponsive to medications and epidural treatments under general anesthesia Where those methods failed to relieve my back problems Neurontin proved be my silver bullet treatment I can tell you first hand that Neurontin kept me standing erect reduced my pain and allowed me to continue working At least 15 years has passed and I continue to take 1 one 600 mg tablet 3xs per day No medication is perfect for everybody and it has some sideeffects but I can without hesitation fully endorse Neurontin for the treatment of back pain Let me first answer your questions directly Of course any infection can ultimately be threatening But pericarditis is generally treatable and cureable The pericaidum is a 2 layered sheath that covers and protects the heart from infection and maligency Pericarditis is inflamation that has occured to the percardium It may be the result of viral or bacterial infections within the body that have infected the pericardium The course of this condition takes up to 3 months for resolution Treatment typically consists of analgestics such as motrin and possibly antibiotics In many cases pericarditis clears up after the up to 3 month treatment has ended and never returns Unless you have left out some complicating detail pericarditis typically runs a predictable course towards wellness At 17 years of age your girlfriend can probably handle the details of this condtion Its really not that awfulIn my opinion she should not be kept in the dark Perhaps talking to your girrfriends doctor would be helpful Do not attack the parents or complain about the silence to their daugter about her condition That individual may be able to encourage the parents to share the details of the illness with the patient who deserves some honest information your girfriend Now please stop worrying While there is no guarantee I feel optomistic about your girlfriends recovery  The first doctor to assess the condition should be your primary care physician The family doctor will be able to review the patients medical history and will have familiarity with your husbands overall health The diagnostic process for neck pain can involve different body systems The pain can be caused by nerve disorders muscle injuries and even some diseases such as infections The general practice doctor can evaluate the symptoms order diagnostic tests like blood work and xrays and determine what kind of specialist is needed Based on your husbands condition and preliminary tests results the primary care physician may start treatment before referring him to one of the following specialist Back and neck problems can become like a painful nightmare Since youve tried OTC medications coupled with heatice compresses without improvement it is time to see the Family Doctor If he cannot be seen within a day or two a visit to the local hospitals emergency room is justified I hope that your husbands condition improves quickly I would show a respectful and calm concern over my ER visit and its resultant findings Three 3 medical conditions were uncovered as follows ERs can be wonderful in stabilizing patients and coming up with a preliminary diagnosis But unless life threatening situations cannot be resolved most patients are sent back home to followup with their medical professional My suggestion is to see your primary care doctor and report the ER findings Your doctor may want to run more testing prescribe medications or refer you to see a cardiologist Periodically well hear on the news of a basketball player who collapses dead while running down the court Just like you they were supposed to be in excellent physical condition Dont let that happen to you make an appointment to see your doctor sooner rather than later A hematoma occurs when blood leaks out of the blood vessel into adjacent tissue areas When a hematoma occurs as I remember from emergency medicine training the principles associated in the acronym  R I C E may be applied as follows R Rest I Ice C Compression and E Elevation You should consider a 2nd medical evaluation if the hematomas appears to be infected hemorrhaging of blood occurs if your dad is taking a blood thinner and bleeding will not stop or if the affected tissue area has not returned to its previous state of being within 46 weeks after first noting the hematomas It can take a month or longer for this type of condition to completely resolve itself My Conclusion Save the pain and tenderness it seems that dad should have a total recovery from his hematoma condition in a rather uneventful manner Of course it is always a judgment call when to seek medical treatment In the case of a 80 year old man your advocacy and good judgment are critical ingredients to his continued safety and quality of health Im inclined to play it safe and not delay in re seeking treatment when the least bit of medical uncertainty exists I hope that this answer has been helpful and your dads recovery is swift and complete Sideeffects do occur with Naproxen and are categorized as common less common  rareAccoring to Drugscom  I would notify the prescriber to determine if a sideeffect is in playing a role in your knee pain  Some medical experts report that if lumbar pain due to a nontraumatic injury does not show improvement within 28 weeks then improvement is unlikely to occur  With that said I suggest that you seek medical attention now as no guarantees of spontaneous healing can be predicted The sooner that a conclusive diagnosis is made and treatment is started the greater the chance of a smooth and timely recovery What is needed now is rest of your back to help healing of the disc and to calm down the nerve pain In that vein of thinking avoidance of lifting twisting and pushing is discouraged Intermittent application of heat and ice may be helpful in alleviating discomfort Judicious use of NSAIDS may reduce pain symptoms Back pain can be very painful and may be physically disabling Sometimes adding to patient frustration is the possible slow movement of treatment options starting with the most conservative and moving painfully and slowly forward to more aggressive types Attempt to negotiate quickly through routine xrays immobilization techniques and cortisone injections that will most likely be your insurance carriers first diagnostic and treatment requirements  I hope that your back condition improves quickly Yes your primary care doctor can refuse to give you a referral to see a pain management doctor A physician may determine the appropriate treatment plan for their patient You have the right to call your insurance company and request a different doctor to service your needs The IR abbreviation in your question stands for Immediate Release Your doctor has determined the current medication dosage based upon your age weight and probably gave the highest consideration to their dosage decision based upon your pain level The typical adult dose of Oxycodone IR is considered to be between 5 mg and 15 mg every 46 hours for pain More than 30 mg every 46 hours for pain in adults is rarely needed The dose for geriatric patients is listed at 25 mg every 46 hours Many experts on the subject of Oxycodone dosage would not consider you to fit the definition of geriatric until you reach at least 65 years of age I also suspect that your prescription contains language such as PRN or As Needed Therefore if your prescription provides the As Needed instruction you should only take the Oxycodone as needed for pain and less frequently than every 46 hours Summary Your doctor is aware that Oxycodone IR is a narcotic that should be prescribed with great caution If your pain is severe I see nothing unreasonable in taking Oxycodone IR 15 mg It is recommended that you have another conversation with your doctor about your level of pain and what action should be taken as your pain lessens Yes foods that we eat can cause black tarry stools But chocolate donuts cookies dont sound like the cause Thinks like black licorice pepto bismuth blueberries and iron supplements are more likely suspects for sources of ingested products causing the blacktarry colorThe diarrhea and feeling light headed can go along with the stomach bug Ibuprofen can be harsh to the digestive tract and might cause some internal bleeding But the shortness of breath is a disturbing symptom when combined with feeling lightheaded and having blacktarry diarrhea This could be a sign of a more significant medical problem and even a medical emergency Conditions such as ulcers gastritis hemorrhoids a stomach tear called MalloryWeiss usually caused by violent coughing and some types of cancer are legitimate medical concerns I recommend that you go to the emergency room of a nearby hospital to ruleout any type of internal bleeding that could change from minimal to massive quickly Be prepared for possible testing including barium studies xrays rectal exam stool specimen culture and a colonoscopy As you can see by this answer many possible causes may be the reason for your present medical condition It is virtually impossible to diagnosis the exact cause of your problem through only your question on this web site Since the possibility does exist no matter how remote that you may be in a serious medical crisis please go the hospital dont hesitate to call 911 where trained medical personnel and testing equipment are available It is important to determine the cause of diarrhea in order for correct treatment steps to happenMuch of the time diarrhea is caused by gastroenteritis Some other causes may include irritable bowel syndrome taking certain medications food absorption problems infections colitis and many other reasons When diarrhea is not resolved within 2448 hours complications may occur For example prolonged nausea  diarrhea can cause dehydration and electrolyte imbalance I am not sure what the term severe  means to you But since three 3 days has passed without resolution despite taking over the counter medications and you are also experiencing pain it is time to see a doctor Here are my suggestive actions Call your doctor for instructions and to receive a possible office visit appointment If that is not possible a visit to the hospitals ER or a walkin medical clinic can be justified Keep yourself well hydrated Follow the BRAT diet BRAT is an acronym standing for bananas rice apple sauce and toast The intent with this diet is to receive nutrition while providing a bland diet a diet low in fiber and a diet that is easier on the gastrointestinal system to process Yes it is possible that you had a heart attack Undiagnosed heart attacks happen frequently and can be serious Some studies suggest that up to 25 of all Myocardial Infarctions Heart Attacks are of the Silent Type where the heart is damaged by a lack of oxygen Women are especially prone to silent heart attacks This type of heart attack may present with symptoms less dramatic than those as described in the elephant sitting on my chest variety  With vague or even no symptoms occurring the heart attack may be overlooked and picked up later on EKG studies Some of the symptoms as you described happening two weeks ago fit with those seen in silent heart attack victims chest pain and weakness An acute myocardial infarction can lead to chronic heart failure where swelling of the ankles is a common symptom A second heart attack may occur bringing with it even more heart damage My suggestion is to notify your medical doctor of your chest pain and swollen feet and ankles Your current symptoms and the recent unsettling medical event deserve to be professionally assessed If you feel like you may be having a heart attack or cannot talk with your doctor soon then a visit to the hospital emergency room is justified Minutes save lives and you may not get a second chance With even a remote possibility of your having had a heart attack It is better to err on the side of caution and see a doctor From the tone of your question it appears that you suffer from intense back pain Severe back pain can control your life and needs to be medically assessed I suspect that youll be disappointed with OTC medications to treat your back pain as they probably wont touch your pain With that said you may consider taking Ibuprofen Ibuprofen is available OTC in a strength of 200 mg Prescription strengths of Ibuprofen are available in 400 mg 600 mg and 800 mg Therefore you could buy OTC Ibuprofen and take up to 4 pills to provide you with the maximum 800 mg strength This practice should only be considered to gain some short term relief 23 weeks max It should also be noted that like most medications Ibuprofen can have serious side effects and even cause stomach ulcers It should be taken with a meal or milk and the daily dosage should not exceed 3200 mg My suggestion is to see a pain management specialist who can prescribe something stronger and assess possible back damage and provide other treatment options Physical therapy and biofeedback may also help or you may need a prescribed narcotic to obtain pain resolution Alonethe two conditions listed in your question pregnancy and hepatitis c leave a lot of possible explanations for your pain Because you have been diagnosed with hepatitis it is a natural inclination to think of the liver when experiencing right sided pain in the back  and it could be related to the liver  But many other system disorders could be also be the cause of your pain Ill list some possible non gynecological reasons first Infections of various kinds and too numerous to list Upper urinary tract obstruction Gastrointestinal issues Thyroid disorders Anxiety Lyme Disease Heart  lung irregularities Other causes Gynecological reasons may include Endometriosis Pelvic congestion Pelvic Inflammatory Disease Preterm labor and delivery Miscarriage Pelvic organ prolapse Other causes As you can see the possible causes for your pain covers a lot of territory The reasons cited above are only a small sampling of all possible causes The best way to determine the root cause of your pain is to visit a doctor  Are you receiving prenatal care A physician can look at your medical history ask questions perform a physical exam order basic diagnosing tests and refer you to specialists For your sake and your unborn babys sake I recommend that you quickly visit your family doctor your obgync doctor or hepatic specialist to obtain medical care It may be true as stated in your question that you cannot receive treatment until after the baby is born But that fact should not deter you from being evaluated by a medical professional If you do not have medical insurance to be evaluated most state governments provide for the free health screenings of pregnant women though the department of welfare There are also many free womens clinics You may also want to explore eligibility for The Womens Infants and Children program WIC Under WIC free food is provided to eligible applicants If the doctor doesnt know what is causing your sleep disturbance then it is time to see a physician specializing in sleep disorders Your sleep hygiene practices appear to be appropriate methods that should produce sleep Most of the sleep medicines that youve tried are of the OTC variety and usually are not recommended by medical professionals The Ambien CR is a prescription drug that should have shown some short term sleep improvement Sleep disorders may be caused by physical or emotional disorders The reason for its occurrence should be established before any form of treatment is initiated Sleep is a very important function that the human body requires to recover energy and workout daily conflicts through dreams  People who sleep poorly and suffer from sleep deprivation may have some of the following symptoms chronic feeling of being tired irritability concentration problems being prone to accidents and many other negative effects This loss of normal sleeping hours can not be madeup at a latter time Sleeping pills are designed for short term usage dont always work and certainly do not fix the underlying sleep disturbance condition I suggest that you have a complete medical exam including serum blood studies The next step is to see a sleep disturbance doctor That person can preform an overnight study monitoring sleeping behavior while your brain activity is being electronically recorded Eventually you may require an MRI of the brain If physical problems do not exists then the next step should be to have a mental health assessment Sometimes things like chronic worry take over our mind and restful sleep will not happen Since your sleeping difficulty originated during your teen years I am inclined to lean towards a medical reason for your sleep disturbance I recommend obtaining a referral to see a physician specializing in sleep disturbances and comeup with a diagnosis that makes senses and can be appropriately treated  Needing a referral for a pain management doctor is dependent upon the pain management doctor and any medical insurance provider that you may have Ive been through a past period of carpal tunnel syndrome pain Resolution can take a long timeThats because in my opinion CTS discomfort isnt always looked upon as a lights  siren condition There are many conservative rungs before more aggressive options are employed on the CTS treatment ladder that must be climbed in a precise order Treatment may be delayed until a definitive diagnosis through imaging xraysCAT Scans confirms the disorder Some doctors including primary care physicians may start the ball rolling with an exam of the affected area steroidal injections order image testing and refer the patient to other medical specialists such as an orthopedist or rheumatologist Other treatment options that may be employed at the lower levels include icing of the area life style changes such as cutting back on computer keyboard usagephysical therapyrest of the affected areabraces  splints to immobilize the painful area and over the counter analgesic medications such as Tylenol Advil Motrin and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs There is a general reluctance to order narcotic medication today in general and most likely not for CTS specificallyThis reluctance extends to pain management clinics and doctors After you have had little or no pain relief for months following the step ladder rungs to the top may you be referred for surgical consideration If the pain is determined to be due to chronic pressure on the median nerve not responsive to more conservative measures surgical repair may be needed Some patients do improve with conservative measures while others may wait a year or longer before necessary surgery is completed After any surgery for CTS repair more physical therapy will be ordered In conclusion  These are my opinions based upon my own personal experiences I am not a physician It is important to work your way up the treatment ladder until your condition improves Do not give up on finding a solution to this annoying condition as permanent muscle and nerve damage may result I wish that the process were easier hope that you have medical prescription insurance coverage and that your pain will soon be a distant memory The answer is a resounding yes  Waiting for a lung cancer diagnosis may be detrimental to the patients health and ultimately their prognosis According to Journal of Thoracic Disease  Many patients report delays in diagnosing their lung cancer disease This delay may contribute to advanced stage at diagnosis and poor long term survival Many aggressive lung cancer cases have already begun to spread by the time that they are initially discovered on screening studies In the large study cited by Journal of Thoracic Disease  patients waited 21 days before seeing a doctor and a further 22 days to complete any investigation The medium time frame from presentation to specialist referral was 27 days and a further 27 12 days to complete further investigation The medium wait time to begin treatment after entering a cancer treatment center was an additional 10 days The overall time from development of the first symptoms to starting treatment was 138 days or more than 4 months I hope that this answer has been helpful and that you are successful in fighting this disease I am sorry for your conditions not being resolved through noninvasive treatments Shoulder pain locking and weakness sounds like a miserable way to live through your daily life I had a severely torn rotator cuff that eventually required surgical repair The pain was almost unbearable at times and was coupled with arm numbness and tingling that did not respond to nonsurgical treatment efforts Having my shoulder repaired was a good decision for me The MRI results coupled with nonresolution of your symptomology through conservation approaches clearly shows that you require surgical intervention Why live with your intolerable symptoms I realize that having surgery under general anesthesia is a big deal Therefore I suggest that you interview an orthopedic surgeon and then seek a second opinion From those two surgeons ask questions that you may have and also determine how many of these surgical repairs that they do in a year Complete a soft background check on both surgeons including an interview review of patient comments and satisfaction rates Chose the surgeon that has a solid clinical record and made you feel most comfortable Ask friends family and neighbors for referrals to shoulder surgeons Check the internet for sites that may actually show you a video surgery being completed that is similar to one that you will undergo You may or may not be hospitalized after surgery but should be given pain medication have multiple followup visits with your surgeon and referred for physical therapy Through selfeducation on your condition and choosing the best surgeon your complete recovery looks promising I trust that my answer has been helpful Chest pains and newly acquired fatigue can be serious symptoms resulting from medication sideeffects You are taking the following medications Benicar is prescribed to treat high blood pressure Synthroid is prescribed to treat hypothyroidism and Simvistatin is prescribed to treat high cholesterol levels Your symptoms may be unrelated to medications but I dont take much stock in coincidences Your statement of  My health has actually seemed to get worse after starting these meds is quite telling Most all medications come with potential side effects including the three that youre taking Additionally some medications may interact together and cause serious medical problems For example I have read that sometimes Benicar and Synthroid dont work well together Here are my suggestions  Call your doctor and explain what is going on If you cannot talk with the doctor soon then discuss your physical symptoms with your pharmacist If all else fails a hospital emergency room evaluation is justified  Do not stop your medication until you notify your doctor of your symptoms  Start keeping a journal to tract exact times of when you take the medications Also document the exact times that you experience the health issues and list activities that you are engaged in at the time of feeling uncomfortable  Your posting appears to be inappropriate for WebMD Answers I dont need to see any pictures The obvious reactions that you were attempting to achieve by inserting sexually crude content failed I am neither shocked nor angry I am disappointed Yes I would recommend being evaluated through the hospital emergency room Preferably youll go to the Hospital ER that is associated with your recent 4 day admission Along with the current clinical exam possible CT Scan and other testing the ER doctor will have a clear historical and updated picture of your acute pancreatitis and gallbladder disease course treatment and prognosis As with most medical conditions early diagnosis of a problem can make the difference between a positive or negative outcome Some of the symptoms listed in your question do suggest pancreatic andor gallbladder maladies Acute pancreatitis may present with some of the following symptoms Bolded symptoms below are also shown in your question Coincidentally Gallbladder Sludge Bile not expelled by the gallbladder during normal metabolic functioning has some of the same symptoms as acute pancreatitis I know all too well of the potentia l for negative consequences if your symptoms are ignored My 58 year old brother died a painful death from acute pancreatitis Please consider calling 911 and have the medical professionals evaluate your physical symptoms Multiple side effects exist for both of these medications These side effects are sometimes divided between common less common and rare Lets look at each drugs patient information sheet as supplied with the medication as it relates to side effects and your tired feeling  1 Gabapentin  This is an antiseizure medication that is also used to treat other conditions such as your back pain Unusual tiredness or weakness is reported as a less common side effect As an anecdotal point of reference I have personally been taking Gabapentin 600 mg 1 tablet 3xs per day for over 15 years without feeling tired Of course were all unique and medications affect us differently 2 Lisinopril  This drug is used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure Unusual tiredness or weakness is reported as a MORE COMMON side effect and it is recommended to call your doctor immediately My Conclusions  Both Gabapentin and Lisinopril both report tiredness as a possible side effect  Gabapentin less commonly and Lisinopril more commonly  More is needed to be known about your possible other medical conditions to eliminate them as a cause of being excessively tired  More information is needed as to when you first started each medication and when you first started to feel overly tired  Your blood pressure appears to be normal abet on the lower side is not a hypotensive reading and probably is not the cause of your being overly tired  I recommend that you contact your doctor assoonaspossible to report your feeling tired It could be a serious medication side effect or represent some other medical disturbance  I remember from a long ago taken anatomy class a muscle that sits in close proximity to the sciatic nerve It is called the pirformis muscle It is not at the top of the list for causes of sciatica but spasms originating in the pirformis muscle can cause compression of the sciatica nerve The pirformis muscle is situated as part of the lower spine and has the sciatic nerve running below it Diagnostic imaging even MRI findings may not always detect Pitiformis Syndrome I hope that youve already received the answers that youre seeking along with a large dose of positive resolutionI just saw your posting today the sixth day and wanted to offer my help I am not an expert in diagnosing medical conditions but do have an education and work history directed heavily in the medical sciences Additionally my daughter and soninlaw have been paramedics for over 15 years With that introduction here are my thoughts on your symptoms and blood studies 1 As you know  some of your symptoms can easily fit into more that one medical category Additionally your symptoms and out of range lab results are suggestive of irregularities that could be associated with various body organ abnormalities Some of these conditions are very serious while many others are much more palatable I am sure that at this point you just want an answer 2 My list of possible medical conditions include  Pyelonephritis  Diabetic Hypoglycemia  Pancreatitis  Miscarriage  Pelvic Inflammatory Disease  Stomach Cancer and  Diverticular Diseases of the Colon Please feel well soon  I did not see the original question and its answer but will address your issue According to H Hospital News  substantial pain is reported by approximately 60 of those individuals diagnosed with ALS The pain level varies from patient to patient and is dependent on factors such as the course of disease progression Burning shooting pain numbness and tingling are reported pain qualities When acknowledged by the patient and investigated by the treating physician pain may be seen as follows with ALS stiffness due to localized injury to the sensory system fat  muscle loss may be responsible for compression of nerves and pinched nerves pain in the legs due to immobility clenched muscles causing painful spasms painful muscle twitching and frozen shoulder causing a throbbing pain and sleep disturbances I hope that my response clearly shows that significant pain is typically a part of ADL Without knowing your medical history or age Ill attempt to provide you with some suggested medical conditions that are being considered based solely on your reported labs and physical complaints as follows Note Many of these medical conditions can share the same symptoms and result in the same outofnormalrange lab results and must be ruled out of the diagnostic picture Additionally many of these possible medical conditions are very serious and require further evaluation by a medical expert Im just throwing some ideas to you in an attempt to be helpful I hope that you obtain the answers that youre seeking and feel well soon I can understand your frustration with severe pain that will not respond to the pain killer as directed Every 6 hours is the recommended interval to take 25 mg and 5 mg Percocet pills Any willynilly taking of Percocet can endup biting you in the end Percocet is a narcotic and must be taken exactly as directed by your physician Negative consequences of increasing the dosage such as overdosing and becoming addicted to this drug are very real possibilities A better plan is to notify the prescribing doctor of your results with the medication Perhaps a different medication or an increased strength of the Percocet will be more effective  Below are the available strengths and recommended dosages as determined by the manufacture and approved by the FDA Percocet Oxycodone HydrochlorideAcetaminophen Dose Maximum Recommended Daily Tablets 25 mg 325 12 Tablets 50 mg 325 12 Tablets 75 mg  325 8 Tablets 75mg  500 8 Tablets 10 mg  325 6 Tablets 10 mg  650 6 Tablets Occasionally a doctor may prescribe a dosage above the recommended amount due to extreme pain or after having been taking the medication over a lengthy period of timeTo avoid eventual problems a physician monitoring and controlling your exact use and dosage of any narcotic medication is absolutely imperative Let me be honest Experts sometimes disagree on the seriousness of degenerative issue and their relevance as a diagnosis and treatment approches Some medical doctors believe that most people approching 30 years of age have some evidence of degerative changes which is a normal part of agingYou do not deserved to be treated poorly and nobody should be forced to endure pain or seek relief through purchasing pain medicationoff the streets With that said receiving pain medications from many doctors is becoming a practice of the past The trend today is for physicans to refer patients such as yourself to pain management specialists and clinicsThe pain management process usually starts off with the lowest level of treatment options and slowly ratches up to more aggresive treatments For example you may be instucted to lose weight wear some sort of back brace otc pain medications applying heat and ice bed rest physical therapy steriodal injections massage and strengthing exercisesThis conservative treatment approach is lengthly and in many cases will not resolve the condition or relieve your painEventually you may be prescribed mild prescription medications such as painkillers and narcotics or offered epidural injections and sometimes back surgery Even the diagnostic testing is fueled by the conservative treatment efforts outlined above Physical exams and Xrays are first utilized with MRIs being ordered much later Much of the sluggish process involved in cases such as you have are due in part to insurance carrier regulations and as your question suggests sterotyping of some individuals motivation for treatment being to obtain narcotic drugs You may try going in other directions by seeing an accupunture doctor a chiropracter doctor or even a hypnotherapist Sometimes these unconventional doctors and therapist are effective in relieving the pain I am sorry that the news is so bleak about caring for people suffering from degenerative bone disease For additional information click on the link below to see an article from WebMd on the topic I wish you well httpwwwwebmdcomosteoarthritisguidespinalosteoarthritisdegenerativearthritisofthespine  The liver is an important part of digestion and may respond negatively to iron sucrose According to drugcom increased liver enzymes have been reported by I5  of those treated with iron sucrose Because of their close association in regulating digestion the gall bladder in addition to the liver may show negative results after administration of iron sucrose It is important to report negative symptoms following iron sucrose treatment to your physician The doctor appears to have appropriately treated your back pain Prednisone is prescribed in your case to relieve arthritic conditions Cyclobenzaprine is prescribed to eliminate painful muscle spasms As long as the following suggestions does not conflict with your physicians orders you may find that moist heat ice packs analgesics and bed rest will reduce the pain level in your back It depends on your pain level Sciatic pain can be just a minor uncomfortable sensation In these cases perhaps analgesics such as aspirin Tylenol Motrin or Advil will relieve your discomfort In many other cases it more like  Just shoot me The pain can be quite intense Over the counter remedies in these situations wont even take the edge off the pain You may try bed rest periodically change your bodys position heat or ice treatments sleeping and sitting on a firm surface walking around during the day physical therapy chiropractor services and acupuncture as 2nd level treatment options In frequent cases the pain will not abate and a physician should be seen to assess your condition They can request blood studies MRI and XRay imaging and refer you to other medical specialist in order to arrive at the root cause of your pain They may also prescribe temporarily until your diagnosis is confirmed steroidal medications muscle relaxants and pain relievers including narcotics until your testing and other specialists are seen These other specialists may recommend additional testing sacral injections epidurals and other invasive treatments including up to surgery Summary Sciatic pain can be minor or severe in nature I dont think that aspirin will work in all but the most minor pain cases The treatment depends on the level of your pain and the diagnosis of your condition Please make an appointment with your family doctor in order to establish a diagnosis and receive treatment as quickly as possible Sciatic pain rarely resolves itself by way of its own volition It could be Sciatica although the pain may be more intense while lying down and sitting with that condition Does the pain extend down to your ankles and feet If so this is suggestive of a Sciatic Nerve disorder Back pain resulting from disc bulging pinched nerves muscle pulls other medical conditions such as growth masses  bone fractures and narrowing of the spinal column stenosis are other possibilities I suggest that you make an appointment to be evaluated by a primary care doctor This individual may review your medical history interview you for the pain quality exact location of your pain pain level flushout possible traumatic events that may have occurred prescribe medications including analgesics and antiinflammatory nonsteroidal drugsconduct blood and urine lab work  get the ball rolling with a radiographic xray This doctor may also refer you to other medical specialists In summary Lower back pain costs the American Economy large amounts of money in medical expenses lost work hours worker compensation claims doctor office visits and intense pain experienced by the patient This type of symptomology requires resolution beginning first with a clear diagnosis Once a diagnosis is established treatment efforts may be started moving from conservation forms like cortisone injections analgesics bed rest pillows placed under the knees chiropractic treatments and ice and heat treatments Although these symptoms sometimes may virtually spontaneously improve in conjunction with some conservative efforts more aggressive testing like MRIs and surgical intervention is frequently necessary It can take a lengthily time to achieve relief months or even years I wish that the process was less cumbersome and more patient friendlyUnfortunately medical insurance companies through their beancounting policies directed at cost saving make most of the bigger treatmenttesting decisions todayThe physician many time finds that their decisions are overturned by some HMO clerk following a complicated reimbursement and procedure manual These sometimes uncaring and reckless institutional decisions can delay diagnosis and the starting of treatment efforts Hopefully a cause for your symptoms will rapidly be determined but please dont count on any quick fix Best wishes for your health improvement  Here are my thoughts that are intended to be helpful 1 It is not normal to still be in pain two years after surgery 2 Anything is possible but I do not think that you had surgery without the break being repaired But it is very possible that the surgery was not successful or that damage occurred after the surgery 3 You should not be subjected to a life full of pain 4 By the way what happened to the original doctor who performed your surgery That individual had a responsibility to follow you postsurgically 5 You need to see a different doctor one that does take you seriously Taking of an xray would seem to be a necessary diagnostic tool that was not employed Having of an xray is rather routine cost effective and many times can even be done in the doctors office I am surprised at the omission of an xray in your case because doctors today can be held accountable for Failure to Diagnosis You should see a doctor specializing in Lyme Disease no matter how long ago that the rash was first observed If you have Lyme Disease It can be and still needs to be treated Over 300000 individuals per year are infected with Lyme Disease The condition requires antibiotic treatment to eliminate all bacteria in order to stop further bodily organ damage This bacteria will fester in the body forever until treated completely The Lyme Disease process may start out with a skin rash fatigue and fever and be dismissed as being somewhat annoying but not being worthy of medical intervention Some later stage symptoms of the condition include heart damage neurological defects arthritis and chronic fatigue syndrome Best wishes for your improved health  Youre correct The anesthesia plays a large role in creating the constipation condition I suggest taking an over the counter product Citrate of Magnesia  It can be purchased in most drug stores supermarkets with pharmacies and perhaps even dollar stores It is a liquid that comes in a couple of flavors it is overall a safe OTC medicine and has as its biggest benefit reliable peristalsis contraction of the bowels Below is a WebMD link containing reviews for this product Of course it is not a delicious beverage even with its flavoring but tolerable to help you in releasing those miserable feelings and probably is ineffective for some people But my experience in helping others with constipation issues through treatment with Citrate of Magnesia has been positive I recommend buying a couple of bottles in case the first one does not produce results I hope that this answer has been helpful and that you feel well soon tpwwwwebmdcomdrugsdrugreview7165CitrateofMagnesiaOralaspxdrugid7165drugnameCitrateofMagnesiaOral Neurontin Gabapentin should not be stopped without discussing the issue with the prescribing doctor Heres why Neurontin was prescribed by a doctor believing that you required this medication Some conditions such as seizure disorders may require a replacement drug Neurontin has the potential for serious and uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms The Neurontin daily dose should tapered down under medical supervision by reducing the dosage over the course of one week Neurontin comes in varying strengths from 100 mg  800 mg capsules or tablets The maximum daily dose could be as high as 3200 mg 800 mg 4xs per day I realize that youve only been taking this med for 6 days but the greater the daily dosage being taken the longer period of time to complete the withdrawal process safely Summary If you are experiencing nasty side effects from Neurontin the medication should either be totally stopped or the daily dosage reduced Both of these alternative resolutions needs to be done in conjunction with the prescribing physician My response is intended to be helpful and offered with respect I would never protect the actions of a rouge doctor or support an inappropriate medical decision In my opinion this doctor did not cross any ethical or legal lines If you were appalled why didnt you question this action when it was made The doctor could have immediately answered your question and explained their reasoning but wasnt given an opportunity You suggest in your question that the doctor should have prescribed something for pain Well thats exactly what happened the oxycodone still in your mothers possession is used as an agent to control pain Would you have felt better if the doctor had written a new prescription for oxycodone How did the doctor know that your mother still had oxycodone remaining from her dental treatment That information must have been volunteered by the patient Upon learning that your mother already had pain medication available why not use it As long as the oxycodone was originally prescribed for your mother and had not reached its expiration date the doctors action was acceptable Perhaps the doctor wanted to save your mother time in waiting at the pharmacy or wanted to save her some money I can only guess the reasons for his decision In summary doctors are licensed to prescribe medications in various fashions These may include suggesting overthecounter drugs providing the patient with factory packaged freesample drugs loose freesample medications placed in a bag with dosing instructions hand writing a new prescription for pharmacy dispensing directing office staff to administer medications provide over the phone orders to the pharmacy email and fax prescriptions sent directly to the pharmacy and even advising a patient to resume medications previously prescribed by another doctor They even have the authority to prescribe medications for conditions that were not intended or approved to be treated with that drug This practice is referred to as OffLabel Prescribing For example some antiseizure medications are also prescribed to treat pain Mixed in with those prescription authorization practices and customs is the necessity to determine who really requires pain medications and who are the individuals that may be manipulating the system in order to feed a drug addiction or to make some street money Doctors have awesome powers and responsibilities in properly prescribing medications They spent years studying anatomyphysiology chemistry biology disease processes and pharmacology They are keenly aware of approaches used to control pain and must first do no harm Some common causes for your three noted symptoms viewed in a collective manner may include Crohns Disease Hypothyroidism Kidney Disorder and Urinary Tract Obstruction Of course may other conditions may be the root of your problems Looking at your symptoms individually may include the following conditions Swelling of legs Kidney disorder cardiac problems blockage of lymph system hormone therapy blood clots and many others Right

individual can exam you question you look at your medical history do preliminary testing and refer you to other specialist if needed Courtney Lets answer your opening question honestly and directlyThe pain management doctor probably doesnt want to talk with you about medications You could discuss hydrocodone but will most likely be dismissed There is a reluctance by most pain management doctors to prescribe pain relief medication due to potential law suits Yes some patients actually sue the doctor and win for causing a drug addiction unscrupulous patients who are actively addicted or those scoundrels who will sell the drugs My orthopedic doctor referred me to a pain management physicianfor severe sciatic type pain and lower back pain A bulging disc was confirmed through MRI studies at L and S1 During my first pain management visit I was given a spinal injection of cortisone The doctor told me that it might not work so upon leaving the office I asked the RN if there was something else that could be prescribed if the procedure failed She flippantly told me to take an Advil as the practice didnt prescribe medicine and that narcotics would not work on nerve pain What an uncaring incompetent statement by a registered nurse or more likely it was just an outright lie On the 2nd visit I underwent a spinal epidural process Both treatment modalities failed miserably and left me in excoriating pain I tried physical therapy ice packs a heating pad motion 800 mg 4xs a day and slept on an 18 wooden board without relief I returned to my orthopedic surgeon who prescribed hydrocodone 5 w325 Tylenol Taking three pills at bedtime actually helps Additionally he scheduled me to see an orthopedic surgeon at the first available appointment during the end of August 2014 to evaluate my condition for surgical consideration I am relating my story to confirm the facts outlined in your question In 2014 many doctors are fearful of prescribing narcotic medications to a 24 year old person or even a 65 year old person Something needs to change in the practice of pain management Doctors take a sacred oath to do no harm I suggest that sending a patient away in severe pain without an adequate treatment pain is causing harm and goes against the principles and spirit of causing no harm I suggest that you find a doctor willing to treat your pain with medication sufficient to relieve the pain At the same time seek out a cause for your pain and have the appropriate treatment completed to resolve your condition without continuing to take pain medication  No LEGITIMATE pain suffer should be forced to jump out of their skin cry in agony or find a drug supplier on the street There are surgical remedies acupuncture and implanted pain control pumps to alleviate even the most torturous pain  Its possible but leg pain is just one symptom of Chronic Venous InsufficiencyCVI occurs when blood in the legs has difficulty in returning to to heart I suspect that something other than CVI is causing your problem The reason for that feeling is that the pain associated with CVI usually gets worse while standing I recommend that you see your family doctor who may refer you to a vascular doctor to conclusively diagnosis your condition through Duplex ultrasond or Venogram testing  Stools that are gray colored may indicate problems with the drainage system involving interactions occurring between the pancreas gallbladder and liver Bile salts are normally released by the liver If there is a liver disturbance bile production may be reduced or the release of bile can be blocked The bile chemicals may buildup in the body and result in gray colored stools Sometimes a yellowing of the skin is also a symptom observed in conjunction with clay colored stools Digestion of the peanut butter may or may not hold any significance in the development of your change in stool color I would recommend not waiting any longer for resolution Stools that are gray colored along with abdominal pain may be indicative of a liver infection or liver disease Anytime that stools are not brown in color is the right time to contact your doctor to have the situation correctly assessed Many of the over the counter pain relievers contain at least some common ingredients Since you do not really know which ingredient in these medications is causing the negative sideeffects it may be a good idea to discuss the reactions with the family doctor and to be referred to an allergist specialist Its really not the that she is reacting to but instead at least one of its ingredients Another valuable source of information is the neighborhood pharmacist This individual if the sideeffect is frequently seen in  may be familiar with the ingredient responsible for the negative reactions There really is no researchable information available to determine the life expectancy of a 93 year old women with stage 4 renal failure But I hope that the following information will be helpful According to a social security calculator program a 93 year old female has a remaining life expectancy of 389 years The same calculator reports her chance of dying this year at 178 But these are only raw numbers based upon statistical averages Every individual is unique Even with her kidney disease being tired lack of appetite and hallucinations she could survive for some length of time or she could pass away shortly One thing for certain is that her pain can be and should be controlled I wish your aunt you and your family peace during this time of uncertainty  Nurofen is a pain reliever and sometimes contains ibuprofen or codeneA Nurofen overdose is not usually fatal but it can cause many serious medical conditions It can take as long as a week for major adverse reactions to occur My advice is to 1 Call poison control and ask for instructions on the best way to immediately handle the overdose 2 Since you may have major symptoms of Nurofen toxicity for up to a week after consumption a visit to the hospital emergency room is justified 3 Followup with having the reasons for the overdose occurring and be assessed by a medical professional or mental health therapist such as a psychiatrist psychologist or trained mental health counselor I dont know where you were emotionally when the incident happened and wont sermonize except to caringly point out the following facts Taking 84 of any kind of pill is absolutely purposeful and could result with negative consequences including death Without treatment this type of episode will most likely happen again and you may not survive Diagnosing your medical condition will require a through patient interview detailing past medical conditions confirming when symptoms first appeared family history age sex medications being taken pain quality describing your pain as burning after eating may suggest a gastric type of disturbance and a physical examination It can be a time consuming challenge to both you and your medical professional to eventually comeup with an accurate diagnosis One point to note is that some pain can be characterized as referred pain That is pain originating from one anatomical location but causing pain in another location A differential type of diagnosing technique may be employed and require more blood studies cardiac testing CT Scans Xrays and other testing Some common disturbances were addressed in the emergency room but a boatload of other possible medical conditions still remain Upper right abdominal pain can be caused by many medical conditions including Your symptoms will require the painstaking investigative work by a competent and methodical physician One by one all possible causes must be eliminated until only one remains  Trauma cannot be excluded  and therefore the fall and tendon injury could be the source of your trigger finger condition I suspect that since youre receiving PT that youve had diagnostic tests such as xrays to ruleout other possible events such as a facture occurring during your accident In trigger finger there is restriction of the flexor tendon The cause has been attributed to inflamation The exact etiology is open to debate but repetitive use frequent and forceful squeezing of tools and hyperextension are on the top of list for its origin It is possible that hyperextension occurred during your fall Treatment efforts consist of cortisone injections immobilization and surgery After 2 injections of cortisone without positive resolution surgery is usually a consideration Below is a link to a WebMd article on the topic httpwwwwebmdcomosteoarthritisguidetriggerfinger Gabapentin or Neurontin is a great medication But like many medications side effects and drug interactions can occur Gabapentin was approved by the FDA to control seizure disorders but is often prescribed off label to treat neurological types of pain While not reported as frequently occurring serious longterm side effects seem to be limited to experiencing more seizure episodes and flulike symptoms Some less serious longterm side effects may include headaches loss of appetite and dizziness I have taken Gabapentin 600 mg 3xs per day for more than 15 years and would never consider stopping this pain treatment My only side effect seems to sometimes feeling excessively sleepy but Ill happily accept that problem in order for my back pain to have been reduced I admire you for seeking out a conclusive way of determining whether back injury may be caused by an auto accident Of course forceful trauma resulting from a car accident may cause back injury Equally obvious is that the Insurance company doctors will deny that herniated disc can be caused by a car accident The truth of the matter is that it is virtually impossible to prove that a car accident either caused or did not cause a back injury The entire process must start by having a candid discussion with the alleged victim Is your victims story credible Does it agree with statements included in accident reports and by their treating physicians Did they have previous back problems which never completely resolved themselves Confirm to the client that the insurance carrier will vigorously uncover all back related conditions that were experienced prior to the accident A preexisting issue with the back that was never fully resolved will certainly impact the outcome of a whiplash claim No prior complaint of back pain may strengthen the clients case but proves little Most people  50 years of age suffer from some arthritis and degenerative disc changes and not have any overt symptoms Next thing that Id pick through with a magnifying glass is the treating physicians report and scan reports Does the medical professional have the facts straight as reported to you by the client Your success will hinge on being as educated as possible concerning back problems picking away at incorrect statements and assessing truthful vs untruthful answers I do not believe that a high serum LDL is related to your symptoms Were your blood sugar levels in range Besides pain high blood sugar levels are a common feature of this disease Acute pancreatitis claimed my brothers life at the age of 58 It is a serious disease that can be life threatening It is a horrible disease and can result in a painful death What was the cause of your acute pancreatitis It is crucial to know the original cause of your condition and that treatment had been and continues to be directed at that cause Causes may be attributable to chronic drinking of alcohol my brother rarely even drank a beer digestive conditions and sometimes heredity factors I recommend that you consult with a University Hospital Endocrinologist Specialist to receive the highest quality of treatment for diseases that may be related to the pancreases Im sorry that you did not receive an appropriate response to your original question Here is some information that you may find helpful It is a safe bet that the knee damage did not occur during the actual surgical procedurePatellar fractures occur most frequently after a blow to the knee occurs such as a fall While complications from total hip replacement do not typically include knee breakage I believe that it is possible Many internet forum discussion responders claim that they experienced intense knee pain after their THR Surgery  I did not see any reports of knee breakage Some posters reported thigh problems after THR surgery It should be noted that blood may collect in the lower extremities like the knee and ankle after THR and results in pain Atrophy of the quadriceps muscle can also happen if exercise programs aimed at strengthening are not started in a timely manner Femur fractures are a possible complication with THR as the thigh muscles can contract so violently that it pulls the patella apart My conclusion The hip femur and knee all work together So it reasonable to conclude that some THR complication caused the knee damage Additionally your wife would surely know if she experienced a violent traumatic event to her knee But since most knee breakage is a result of trauma such as experienced in a fall it will be difficult to attribute the knee damage to the THR Surgery I hope that your wife will feel well soon Although I do not know your age number of years drinking or your normal alcohol intake it sounds like youll be ok this time But if the discomfort persists for more than 48 hours then a visit to the doctor is justified Alcohol is a caustic drug Bloating and minor abdominal pain may be the first symptoms that your liver is being assaulted In time a liver will become fatty with chronic alcohol consumption Some heavy drinkers will eventually develop liver scaring and be diagnosed with cirrhosis which can be deadly I respectfully recommend that you listen to your body and take a serious and honest inventory of your heavy drinking episode as it may ultimately impact your overall future health

antiinflammatory drug NSAID used for temporary pain relief fever reduction and protection against swelling In general ibuprofen also acts as a vasoconstrictor Ibuprofen is rapidly absorbed following administration and is rapidly distributed throughout the whole body The excretion is rapid and complete via the kidneys After complete excretion of Ibuprofen It will no longer reduce pain fever or protect against affected area swelling Ibuprofen will not cure back problems Maximum plasma concentrations are reached 45 minutes after ingestion if taken on an empty stomach When taken with food peak

street drug abuse and cost savings measures reimbursement for pain relief through insurance providers has been severely curtailed Ultracet is prescribed for moderate to severe pain It is a combination of Tramadol and Acetaminophen Ask your physician if they feel comfortable in prescribing Tramadol Reports show no difference in the therapeutic pain relief offered by Tramadol when compared to Ultacet In essence you would be taking your current medication minus the acetaminophen If your insurance carrier will not cover the Utracet perhaps they will cover Tramadol Both Tramadol and Ultracet are marketed as the hydrochloride salt by Janssen Pharmaceutical and as Ultram in the United States They have a patient assistance program to help needy individuals qualify for free medication Research the manufacturers web site for qualifying details that may include Having a valid prescription  The Ultracet cannot be covered through private insurance Medicare D or State Medicaid programs You must meet income guidelines ranging from 11 170 annually for 1 person up to 23050 annually for a household of four people For larger families the income limit is 200 of the FPIG Note The application can be cumbersome if you are currently taking more than one other medication It is great that you have an appointment scheduled with the doctor on Monday I can understand your concern but the best action to take until Monday is to relax take care of yourself and enjoy life The WebMD audience is knowledgeable but cannot confirm or deny your suspicions based solely on the information contained in your question Of course some of your symptoms could be as a result of colon cancer but could also be the result of some other GI disturbance Your situation is unique and deserves to be professionally assessed with diagnostic tools such as a colonoscopy blood testing and imaging studies The link below is from a WebMD article that describes colon cancer in greater detail httpwwwwebmdcomcolorectalcancerguideunderstandingcolorectalcancersymptoms  I wish you the best  Nohard thank you for your answer Your suggested article was interesting and appreciated I had read that Tart Cherry Juice specifically contains antiinflammatory properties which helps with nerve control may improve gout symptoms and protects against muscle damage and the development of arthritis Im taking a leap of hope that some WebMd posters may have tried Tart Cherry Juice and can report on their experiences I m looking for some reliable accountings from our peers to either support or refute what I had read The product is somewhat pricy but worth it if is effective in treating back pain Yes limit walking on this injury A foot contusion is another name for a bone bruise of the foot Even that term is misleading because a foot contusion is really a fracture of the outermost bone layer It can be painful with recovery taking 6 weeks  12 weeks Hopefully you iced and immobilized the injured area soon after its occurrence to reduce the recovery time Although unusual a foot contusion can take as long as a year to completely heal I suggest seeing a foot doctor to thoroughly exam the injury and make medical recommendations The foot doctor can prescribe special socks that are cushioned and padded shoes to make your recovery more bearable Consider using a cane walker or crutches to complete daily tasks until you see the doctor You should also be receiving some medication to reduce discomfort from pain Im sorry for your dads bad surgical experience I know how it is to have a family member who had surgery and also had a foreign object left behind It happens more frequently than one might think Some studies indicate that sponges or surgical tools are left in the body of the operative patient in 1 out of every 1000 surgeries It may even have higher rates Today some hospitals in addition to object counts being conducted prior to surgical closing are using sponges with computer chips to ensure that this preventable surigical error does not happen Symptoms of a foreign object left after surgery is usually limited initially to infection and requires a 2nd surgery to remove the object and cleanup the infection Items not immediately noted as being left behind may result in degrading of the object movement of the object blockages within the body and severe painThis type of surgical error will require corrective surergyThis later discovery of a foreign object may not occur until months or even years have passed since the original surgery Your question states in part He has had all kinds of test but the doctors say they dont know Thats a very inexact statement I really dont know what testing was done or what the results wereI would ask thoes doctors in a very precise manner exactly what testing was done and can it be conclusively ruled in or out as to whether a foreign object was left behind You should not be experiencing hurting sensations in your sides or chest after two months of having experienced Dry Heaves Dry heaves is the sensation of feeling nauseous but being unable to vomit It may be the result of a nervous condition overindulgence of food or beverages morning sickness and many other reasons This disorder can be very uncomfortable but is usually only a temporary disturbance When the symptoms are not resolved on their own within a day a doctor should be consulted Some results from the retching can include brain pressure torn muscles rib trauma dehydration causing electrolyte imbalance aspiration of food into the lungs causing aspiration pneumonia and blood vessel ruptures A specific side effect observed with dry heaves is a condition called MalloryWeiss Tear This tear in the mucus membrane of the esophagus  may require emergency room treatment due to internal bleeding and possible inpatient hospitalization Ive given you some ideas but am not a doctor After two months of having uncomfortable feelings do not delay in making an appointment with your doctor This person has the medical training knowledge of your medical history can ask you questions and can perform diagnostic testing Anatomically the right side of our abdominal cavity protects a fairly significant number of vital organs Some possible conditions producing pain on the right side besides the pancreas include ovarian cystkidney infectiongallstones kidney stones constipation ectopic pregnancy appendicitis endometriosis crohns disease ulcerative colitis gas or flatulence pulled muscles liver disease and others  Oxycodone is an opiate used to relive pain Opiates such as oxycodone work to both block the pain and by masking the pain According to Spine Universe  Opioids work to relieve pain in two ways Lung cancer may spread to other organs of the body including the stomach or to the other lung When cancer spreads to other organs it is referred to as metastasis Therefore a cancer originating in the lungs and which has spread to the stomach is called  Sometimes it can be difficult to determine which original organ was first assaulted by cancer cells At times the metastasized cancer may actually be uncovered and treated before the primary organ where the cancer originated is discovered Treatment options are dependent on the number of tumors the stage of cancer development when discovered in the stomach and the overall general health of the patient Since the total areas where cancer has spread is unknown surgery for removal of the stomach is not the usual treatment preference More likely are chemotherapy alternatives that can systematically attack all of the cancer cells Two or more days must pass after the inflammation and pain has subsided The pancreas needs to rest with nutrition and medication being received through IV administration nothing by mouth is permitted during these critical few days of intense healing After the crisis period has passed liquids and small portions of a soft diet are started If this diet is tolerated well over a few days four to six small mealssnacks per day of a more normal consistency are begun If chronic pancreatic was diagnosed then long term dietary changes must occur These changes in diet may include low fats and the reduction or elimination of fried and barbequed foods With either acute or chronic pancreatitis the drinking of alcoholic beverages is usually discouraged Pancreatitis can be life threatening my brother died a horrible death from this disease In order for recovery to occur dietary sacrifices must be a large part of the treatment process I hope that this answer has been helpful and that you feel better soon   Youre most likely behaving that way in response to unrelieved pain There is a strong relationship between being in a chronic state of pain and experiencing emotional distress Pain can cause individuals to become depressed and angry It can become a vicious cycle where a person has ongoing and severe pain and then becomes upset moody anxious and angry They have more pain and become even angrier and perhaps even agitated When the anger turns to aggressiveness and violence immediate emotional help must be sought Otherwise the chronic pain and the resultant aggressive behavior may cause you to suffer disciplinary and legal consequences I recommend that you consider following some of the below listed suggestive actions Hopefully some of these suggestions will be helpful At this point youre probably just tired of being in pain Nobody should have to experience chronic pain to the extent that it overtakes their basic personality and controls their life Pneumonia is treated with antibiodics and symptomatically When coupled with COPD or other inflammatory illnesses of the lungs I have seen given But not necessarily to treat pneumonia alone definitely food containing no seeds or nuts UTI You need to see a doctor immediately It sounds like you have a serious condition not sure what it could be but you should definitely be looked at as soon as possible You might want to ice your forearms after working Also you might want to buy some carpal tunnel wrist splints to wear You can wear these at night Listen to your body and gradually build up your strength There is a chance that the ganglion may have returned It might be a good idea to have your knee evaluated again Sometimes a Bakers Cyst can become large and track down the calf and cause pain An MRI would show this if that was the case There are not any supplement that have been shown to reliably treat tendonitis There are braces NSAIDS topical antiinflammatories physical therapy and PRP platelet rich plasma injections that have been shown to work If it has been three weeks you should probably get this checked out by your physician Simple strains and sprains usually get better in three to five days The most common condition that causes anterior knee pain in a runner is patella femoral syndrome Usually there is no need for surgery or medications Physical therapy is the main treatment for this condition If pain persists further work up by your physician and a radiological evaluation may be needed Usually this strain resolves in a few days The simplest treatment for muscle strains are listed below If you are pain free then you can return to running Let pain be your guide The worrisome symptoms for back pain are pain radiating down your leg or numbness pain not responding to over the counter pain medicines and pain with bowel or blader problems Depending on the degree of the injury the time to heal will vary You can start with the following Rest It is important to rest following the injury so it can heal Let pain be your guide on how much activity you can do Stretching Gentle stretching should be helpful but it should not be painful Ice soon after the injury Ice will help calm the inflammatory response and stimulate blood flow to the area This can be done the first 2 days after the injury Usually 20 minutes of icing 3x a day Heat Gentle heating before activity can help loosen the muscle Apply a heat pack prior to stretching or exercising Oral antiinflammatory medications These can help relieve symptoms of pain and also calm the inflammation Physical Therapy If you are still having pain you should see a doctor and you may be referred to physical therapy They can do certain treatments called modalities to help you I had this problem and it turned out to be a hemorrhoid my doctor recommended benefiber which is taste free and it actually worked Could be pinch nerve in neck have a Nerve conductive test done ask doctor I have the same thing an thats what we found was pinch nerve in neck  Even though I could walk even after falling What are the possible injuries Dont know whats wrong Do know that you should see an eye doctor Well you should bring her to the doctor I had a tick on my armpit once and the doctor was a big help he dug the whole tick out So if this is what the doctor has said that you have a pulled muscle and you have had no relief it is time for the second opinion I had pain between my shoulder blades did all the PT meds everything come to find out I had broken my neck in two places C3 C5 not fun I think I would get a new MRI or CT of the spine neck shoulder other things could have changed or be damaged more by now since you report no improvement You can not function in pain There is a reason for pain its the body telling you SOMETHING is wronng So go get another opinion if you have to have a referral just ask your doctor for one NO BIG DEAL he works for you remember said the nurse LOL seriously have it all checked again something is def wrong Blessings and Be well The Xray may show bursitis it is extremely painfully so no it is not a wast of time Im no doctor but thats how they found bursitis in my hip and shoulders I had total knee surgery twice First the left knee and then the right My doctor gave me the correct excersizes to do thank heavens In comparison to some other people I had spoken with what I did was right I had the physical therapist come to the house for the first time And you  MUST DO THESE EXCERCISES TWICE A DAY WHETHER YOU FEEL LIKE IT OR NOT  30 minutes before you start excercizing you take your pain pill Then lay flat and start leg raises one leg at a time Keep stiff leg and work to get that leg as high up as you can Then do peddling a bicycle with the little 2 foot high bike you can get at a medical store to rent Or maybe you can do that laying down and peddle like a bike with both legs Try it Dont baby yourself I was given a long strip of plastic like a strip of inertube and you put that under the ball of your foot of the affected knee sit straight up and pull it tight with both hands and press down like you are stepping on a gas pedal in the carKeep your leg straight and the rubber tight Eventually you will have to lift some sort of weight with your legSit in a chair and tie something to your ankle like a can of something heavy in something you can put around the ankle to hold it as the weightRrAISE SLOWLY RELEASE SLOWLY RAISE SLOWLY RELEASE SLOWLY These are some of the excersizes I did But when you are done doing all of these put an ice bag on the knee for about 20 minutes Rest YOU MUST UNDERSTAND IF YOU DO NOT DO THE EXERCIZES YOUR DOCTOR GAVE YOUYOU WILL END UP LIKE YOU ARE By this time you should be well on the way to no pain and swelling The ice bag after therapy is probably the answer for you But going to therapy out of the house will stop you from taking you pain pill before you start I would guess Just that little help to ease the pain will make you work harder You might do better doing all your therapy at home using the pain pill and ice packs I hope this might help you You didnt state what you therapy involved  Then you progress from 2 crutches to one crutch on the opposite side of the bad knee From that you go to a cane NO WALKER Its best to speak with your folks and make an appointment with a doctor Theres really no way to tell whats at the root of these episodes without having answers to questions such as past fainting spells previous heart surgeries heart murmurs etc A physical exam blood tests and imaging of your heart can help pinpoint the cause Your age would make one wrongfully assume this is not serious Yet heart diseases such as valvular problems congenital heart disease pathology causing irregular heart beats can and do occur in young people These and other conditions that cause palpitations should be addressed And if youve had fainting episodes in the past you should be evaluated early Yes you could still be pregnant Even with the best contraceptive method if you are sexual active theres always the possibility that you can get pregnant A womens cycle can vary in days from month to month  ovulation doesnt always happen exactly on day 14 With all the hormones that control the female menstrual cycle theres quite a bit of variation in the timing of ovulation and your fertile days A home pregnancy test can detect pregnancy with 97 accuracy but not all of them are this sensitive or accurate Waiting a few weeks after a missed period increases the accuracy of the test As far as abdominal pain if its worsening or more severe and includes symptoms such as vomiting fever pain with movement you should be evaluated as soon as possible There are endless possibilities as to what could cause this pain and a physical exam  testing would be neededxmlnamespace prefix  o ns  urnschemasmicrosoftcomofficeoffice opop Vaginal bleeding during or after sex and at no other times makes me think of trauma to the cervix or vaginal or a lack of lubrication and abrasion of this tissue An accompanying symptom could be painful sex but this doesnt directly point to either condition An endometrial polyp could also cause bleeding during sex Your medical history and other signs and symptoms on physical exam will help your doctor determine the cause However other exams and tests such as an ultrasound may be needed Talk with your partner about your concerns and make an appt to see your gyn I would try to see a neurologist and at least get a CATscanonce youve seen your doctor I have no experience with those symptoms but my sister complains of this when she get her migrane headaches I have had trouble with pain in this area in the past when my gullblader was bad once I had it removed things were normal again Sometimes stones get caught in the common duct and can be very painful I know someone who has an ulcer and suffers from pain in this area When the stones get stuck in the common duct it affects the panciase and is very painful too Best advice is to see your Dr as soon as posible Do you have neuropathy and are you diabetic If you dont about the neuropathy talk to your doctor Also always make sure your A1C is within range That determines if you have diabetes knee conditions leg needing relinement broken hip hip needing relinement favoring one side or the other back out of adjustment fractured back lspine This should be done as soon as possible I like you have suffered from anxietypanic attacks since childhoodI sought help in my mid twenties and my like is wonderful now Xanax has a generic version called alprazolam that only costs a couple of dollars a month Go to a doctor or clinic and explain your condition and get some helpI did therapy and it was rather expensiveso at the very least get some Alprazolam and see if it will make you feel much bettergood luckdont wait Maybe muscle spasmshave you seen a doctor about it Thats the only thing I can think it could be Thats what mine sort of feel like when I have them in my back Any chest pain should be regarded seriously especially if it is significant of unknown origin or very sudden Its causes can be anywhere from entirely harmless to immediately lifethreatening so it might be best to err on the side of caution and go to a doctor or emergency room  it is better to overreact and find out that it is something manageable than to wait and find out that it was very serious potentially permanent I think its highly improbable that this has come from lifting your baby not least of all since this started while you were asleep It is very possible that this pain cardiac related but there are a great number of other things that could be causing it Again I would recommend that you seek emergency care for something this sudden  better to be safe than sorry especially since you have a child to care for It is possible that your symptoms could be related to stress over fear of pregnancy  which due to the intensity of your anxiety might evoke a stress reaction other less intense stimuli dont  but it is also possible that they are related to something completely unrelated Stomach problems are rarely specific to any single illness or condition so a visit to your regular doctor might be in order Heshe could tell you conclusively if youre pregnant or not Im going to take a guess only a GUESS that youre not and point you in the right direction if anything still seems wrong If the pain stops when you get to school where you probably have plenty of things to distract you from it it is not unlikely that the discomfort is mental to some degree or at least minor enough to not be anything too serious Keep in mind there is a distinct possibility that your discomfort has absolutely nothing to do with your sexual experience at least not directly it might have been a coincidence that it happened to start around the same time so it wouldnt be unreasonable for you to have linked the two in your mind It might be related to your birth control assuming you just started it many people have stomach problems as a side effect to starting new medications A doctor can sometimes prescribe a different medicine for the same purposecondition as different medications even for the same condition can have different fewer or sometimes worse side effects Check with your OBGYN Almost everything is connected to Ovaries Id bet somehow when your in the mood there is something going on with the Ovaries Wow  sounds like some form of edema  I would definitely have her see a doctor Soon I think so A sensitive skin with the burning sensation You may wanna ask your doctor if its a different type of pain  I was told I had Pleurisy after I ended up going to the hospital I was having terrible pain in my shoulders stabbing feel when I would breath in This was over a month ago and after I went to the hospital I followed up with my doctor a week later To this date I still have the pain in my shoulders It will go from one side to the other in days this happens when I wake up in them morning I do not have chest pain any longer How long

put my on a Zpak and predisone and proventic hfr After that my doctor would not refill the predisone she gave me Indomethacin 50mg cap This medicine makes me sick to my stomach I dont have any insurance I already have a 300000 bill from the hospital Is this normal for my shoulder pain to still be thereof course it not as painful as it was when I first went to the hospital it just more stressful now to deal with this everyday Thank you in advance for your help Sincerely Carolyn Barrett Carolynbrayyahoocom Yes it happened to me and I now have a 22yr old son Get checked Hello I understand what you are going through My Grandmothers boyfriend has your problem I would advise seeing a Doctor first and if he wants you to get tests done then go to a hospital Good luck There are promising new treatments that are being developed using stem cells to stimulate cartiledge growth Your orthopedic surgeon is focused on surgery so he probably wont mention this and may not know about

Since then Ive had only 1 one migraine  hallelujah GROIN MUSCLE PULL G I BLEED One may have the wrong strenght in their personaland or reading glasses Whomever gave the shot most likely gave the shot in the fat of the arm instead of the muscle You have an infection seek physician ASAP I have been taking care of children my whole life and have two of my own My experience with this type of pain could be one of a few things i will list them and then explain below too much fresh fruit and veggies not enough water in her diet Celiac disease dairy sensitivity crohns disease Your doctor can test her for celiac or you really you can do it on your own if you are to the point that you are fed up with doctors Celiacs are on a Gluten Free diet nothing with gluten whatsoever and that includes alot of things that you wouldnt think have the so called no no ingredients in them so I would research gluten free diets just to be sure Im not really sure what crohns disease consists of however ive had friends that have it and experience the same thing your daughter is going through here is a website you can look at for that that they referred me too httpwwwcrohnsandcolitisinfocomcidppcppdgglcrohnsdaccinfonontvcrohn27sdiseasePhrase My nephew had dairy sensitivity and it cause these issues as well If she is an avid milk drinker I would consider lowering the fat content of the milk for a while for instance if you have her on whole milk go to 2 that kind of thing And limit her other dairy intake for a while butter yogurt cheese etcif it helps some just by reducing these things then you know its a dairy issue and i would switch her to soy milk rice milk or something of the sort and stop the cheese alltogether believe it or not not enough water in her diet can cause these issues as well they could be anything from sever pain to constipation or a mixture of the two I have had this issue myself the correct amount of water to have is 8 8oz glasses in a 24 hour period if you cant get her to drink it dry using the new koolaid liquid drink mixers or crystal light something of the sort just be sure whatever you mix with the water does not contain aspartame as this is poisonous for the human body if given too much over a long period of time last but not least too many fresh fruits and veggies can cause severe gas build up which can lead to pain and constipation as well try sticking to the food guide pyramid with this though you can look it up online to suit her age and weight and everything as to how much she should have These are all from personal experience or from close friends and family that have had these issues I hope this helps It could honestly be anything There is a high chance it is painful anxiety there could be inflammation or even something to do with your posture I used to continually get pains in my arm and occasional backache once I sorted out my posture and weight I was slightly over weight and fixed my bra size everything eased I wouldnt take all 10 ambien at once That stuff can turn you into an amnesic zombie You wont know what you did until you read the police report the following week Just take one and you should be fineprobably I would recommend that you visit with your doctor before starting an exercise routine and to fill out a Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire PARQ such as one found here httpswwwcmichedufasrasurecMembershipsDocumentsParQpdf The second question asks if you feel pain in your chest when you do physical activity to which it suggests that you meet with your doctor You may be able to do exercise as long as you start slowly and gradually build up or you may be restricted with the types of activities that you can do You doctor will work with you to diagnosing any problems and guiding you with how you should approach physical activity 0 percent chance Though I may not be a health expert I really doubt you can break your penis due to the fact that there is no bone located there it is cartilage yes you can injure it while its erect but I dont think the pain would remain a permanent thing have your husband pin down where the joint pain is If its in the hip there is a condition called avascular necrosis that can happen where the blood flow to the hip bone decreased due to HIV andor the medications and the hip bone dies in the areas that arent getting enough blood and oxygen There is also something happening with people who have been living with HIV and on meds for many years called fragility syndrome  The condition is poorly understood and we dont always know whether its a side effect of medications or the byproduct of long term inflammation from your body fighting the virus yes even when on meds and undetectable that causes accelerated arthritis heart disease and other conditions related to inflammation Have your husband go to his doctor and ask for either an Xray of the area that is bothering him or whats called a DEXA scan which will tell him and his doctor if he is experiencing some bone thinning similar to osteoporosis that women have after menopause as a result of HIV or the meds If it is or even if it isnt it may be a good idea for him to be on calcium and vitamin D daily to help keep the calcium in his bones which will keep them strong  Actually sometimes complete ruptures only cause pain in the immediate post injury period The best example I can give is people with significant tendinosis of the long head of the bicep tendon This tendon goes from intraarticular to extraarticular and then down the arm in front When inflamed it can be quite painful causing chronic anterior shoulder pain For some this tendon eventually ruptures they have a shot of severe pain swelling and bruising and then their chronic shoulder pain is gone Their bicep muscle looks different but the pain is better Do not use only pain as your guide Weakness or other functional deficits can also be a sign of a complete rupture with or without severe pain An MRI will definitely identify the extent of the muscle injury and it is a noninvasive test that gives you a lot of information yup u will be play ball again very soon so dont need to worry  Depending on xray results to verify a pinched nerve could be a main factor coupled with excessive strain and lack of restsleep pinched nerve is a colloquial term and not a true medical term It is used to describe one type of damage or injury to a nerve or set of nerves Plantar fasciitis PF is a painful inflammatory process of the plantar fascia theconnective tissue or ligament on the sole bottom surface of the foot It is often caused by overuse of the plantar fascia increases in activities weight or age It is a very common condition and can be difficult to treat if not looked after properly Longstanding cases of plantar fasciitis often demonstrate more degenerative changes than inflammatory changes in which case they are termed plantar fasciosis 1 The suffix osis implies a pathology of chronic degeneration withoutinflammation Since tendons and ligaments do not contain blood vessels they do not actually become inflamed Instead injury to the tendon is usually the result of an accumulation over time of microscopic tears at the cellular level Look up Plantar fasciitis  Wikipedia the free encyclopedia Thank you for respondingIve had hypo for 9 years but my last tsh was

a little She was 97 then If it worked for her my guess would be it will work for all Im 53 and have had issues with this I have found that by stretching the calves more the pain either goes away completely or subsides enough to be comfortable I cannot remember when but Muscle and Fitness magazine had an article based on this I was informed by my fitness coach as we age our muscles tend to tighten up So more stretching was reccomended and it seems to work for me Give it a try what have you got to lose except the sore muscles Also try a little icyhot and massage that in well Sitting  Did you think for Checking for Kidney Stones I think you must As a former pain pill addict and current medicinal user of cannabis I must respectfully disagree with the doctor New research is showing that marijuana does not effect the memory in the ways previously thought However I will admit the effects of marijuana on an elderly patient especially one that has never used it before may be a bit overwhelming Are you in a state where it is legal medicinally because it would be best to do under the care of a doctor considering the age factor Marijuana is a much safer form of pain control than traditional narcotics It is also being shown to have benefits on numerous other conditions You can always do the research if you have any doubts or concerns Also to answer your original question marijuana does not come in pill form there is a synthetic pill called marinol but it is not exactly the same as cannabis and is usually only prescribed for cancer patients There is a variety of ways to reap the benefits of marijuana I would suggest cannabis oil A little bit placed under the tongue can go along way There is also edibles such as cookies cakes and brownies but those tend to have a more psychoactive effect and may be a bit too overwhelming Smoking it is an option but with the patients age I would advice against this If you are in a state where it is legalized for medicinal use talk with a doctor about your options If unfortunately your in a state like me where its not you can always find all the information you could ever want or need online Just be careful and make sure you check the sources of the information your reading Also be careful of the law as I can personally attest to even if your just trying to use a safe alternate to treat your pain they will still treat you like a criminal It would depend on the doctor and the conditions needing to be treated A variety of other factors could come into play in the final decision the doctor makes However I would guess they would be A LOT less likely to prescribe narcotic pain meds if your already using pot I currently live in Utah and I know that every time I tell a doctor I use marijuana I have just pretty much given up any chance of that doctor giving me anything else for pain control I hate to contradict the doctor but new studies are showing there is no correlation between marijuana consumption and harm to a fetus Depending on how you consume it may be a factor I would definitely not smoke it If you are in a medicinal state I would find a doctor who deals with medicinal cannabis as they are going to be the best ones to answer all your questions 100 I have known multiple women who have used cannabis throughout their entire pregnancy and their children are healthy and very intelligent I would consult your doctor asap They may want to do a scope to look inside your throat for possible tumors What kind of pain is it Is it located in your throat itself or in the neck in general It sounds like you are having symptoms of GERD or acid reflux disease With your age and history and the length of your symptoms it is HIGHLY unlikely you are having a heart attack If you have a history of anxiety and heartburn it could very well turn into GERD I have acid reflux and the symptoms your describing coincide with GERD I find taking an extra strength Zantac 150 mg once every morning keeps me from experiencing any symptoms If that doesnt help or doesnt help ENOUGH you can always speak to your doctor There are proton inhibitors they can prescribe you that will work much better Proton inhibitors slow the production of stomach acid However if you are having any other symptoms or your current ones get worse I would definitely contact your doctor right away It sounds like you may have hurt your rotator cuff I popped mine lifting bags that were too heavy for me I couldnt lift my bent elbow above my shoulder or straighten out my arm above my head It hurt down the back of my arm in the triceps area to the elbow and biceps Unable to move my arm backward Had to see the doctor By the way it doesnt go away just stays the same or gets worse I know this because I waited over a year thinking the pain would subside Sounds like you may have a problem with your sciatic nerve This nerve is easily damaged The pain with a damaged sciatic can be in either one side or both of you buttocks and sometimes more often than not the pain reradiates down the back of your leg Taking Aleve or ibuprofen helps with the pain I usually use a heating pad or a ice bag to help with the pain and take Aleve and move around as much as possible Hope this helps If the rash is on the same side of the back as on the chest and is only in that one area it could be an early sign of shingles medically known as varicella zoster virus This is a reactivation of chickenpox It occurs in the distribution of one given sensory nerve can be painful and is often followed by a blistering rash in the same location It should be treated as early as possible in order to avoid longerterm pain after the rash resolves I would recommend an immediate visit to your dermatologist for an evaluation Look for shampoos and cleansers that contain salicylic acid You can also look for washes with benzoyl peroxide If that does not help control the issue its time to see your dermatologist for further evaluation and treatment They may prescribe an antibiotic by mouth along with a prescriptionstrength shampoo to help clear the breakout faster and minimize the risk of scarring If the rash is on the same side of the back as on the chest and is only in that one area it could be an early sign of shingles medically know and varicella zoster virus This is a reactivation of chickenpox It occurs in the distribution of one given sensory nerve can be painful and is often followed by a blistering rash in the same location It should be treated as early as possible in order to avoid longerterm pain after the rash resolves I would recommend an immediate visit to your dermatologist for an evaluation Sounds like a hernia Have him checked out by a doctor Do you still have your appendix If so you should go to the ER Gastroenterologist Why take a chance get to the doctor or hospital I have pain in my lower left side also Its been there for months I have many tests Doctors could find no reason for the pain I would have it checked out if it continues The symptoms you described happen often in people that work out without drinking enough water Even if you think youre drinking plenty try drinking more and see what happens ANYONE The only reason to avoid Body pain is to take proper and regular exercise Dont forget to maintain Diet Chat Thats very interesting because Vicodin generic name is hydrocodone with acetaminophen contains a narcotic that normally causes drowsiness When a person reacts to a medication in the opposite way as expected its called a paradoxical effect Some sleeping pills are well known for having a paradoxical effect on people keeping them wide awake all night long In general experiencing a paradoxical effect from medication is nothing to be concerned about Its not an allergy or anything like that It just indicates your body responds differently to that particular medication Even if the hydrocodone controlled your pain you dont want to take a medication that causes you insomnia You might consider scratching hydrocodone off your list and requesting a different prescription pain reliever the next time you need one Just let the doctor know how hydrocodone affects you There are plenty of other narcotic pain relievers to choose from Wishing you well Ow Sorry youre going through this The only way to tell for sure whats going on with your ribcage is to get a physical examination from a health care provider Start with your primary care provider He or she can evaluate this problem and refer you for tests xray for example or a specialist if needed Its not uncommon for the cartilage between ribs to become inflamed or even torn from some sort of trauma which could be as slight as overexercising However the pain youre describing could be caused by something else entirely It could even be related to structures below your ribcage Thats why your best bet is to get a physical exam as soon as you can Good luck to you If youre feeling discomfort from the kidney stone your best bet is to return to your health care provider and let him or her know You didnt say when your stone was diagnosed but if the pain is a new symptom or if its gotten worse since you were diagnosed then thats something your doctor would want to know about If the pain is accompanied by a decrease in urine production Id suggest you visit an urgent care facility This combination of symptoms could indicate the stone is blocking a ureter which is the tube that drains urine from the kidney to the bladder Otherwise a routine appointment with your primary care provider may be enough I hope you get some relief from the pain soon Thats up to your oral surgeon As a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory NSAID medication Naproxyn can cause bleeding Some dentists dont want their patients taking a blood thinner after an extraction Other dentists dont seem to care if you do or not Your oral surgeon should have given you written discharge instructions that explained what you should and should not take for pain after the extraction If you did not receive such instructions call the office In the meantime you can take acetaminophen Tylenol which is not a blood thinner Thats assuming youre not allergic to acetaminophen Be careful not to exceed the maximum daily dosage of acetaminophen as doing so can cause severe health consequences You also can apply ice packs to your face for comfort care Wishing you well I can hear the frustration in your question Its always annoying when we do what were told and our medical problem still doesnt clear up Unfortunately only your doctor can tell you whats going on I can tell you that some infections require more than one course of antibiotics to treat Or they require a very specific antibiotic Because your physician knows your medical history he or she can look into this further to determine what the best course of action is Im sorry youre going through this All of us in medicine sometimes wish we had a magic wand in order to cure peoples conditions immediately As of right now were still waiting Hang in there Yes it definitely can refers to narrowing of the spinal canal The spinal canal is a narrow opening within the vertebrae bones of the spine that allow the spinal cord to pass through When the spinal canal becomes narrow it puts pressure on the roots of the nerves that run from the spinal cord to various body parts In the lumbar spine which is located in the lower back the nerves transmit sensation from the legs to the brain If a nerve in the lumbar spine is pinched it can cause the legs or a single leg to transmit pain signals If youve been diagnosed with lumbar spinal stenosis your doctor should be able to treat your pain in the short term and suggest some ways to deal with the problem in the long term I suggest you consult your doctor to find out what your options are I hope you feel better soon Im sorry to hear youre going through this It sounds painful It probably would be a good idea to follow up with either the surgeon who performed the gallbladder removal or with your primary healthcare provider There are several possible reasons why youre having the pain you describe  among them is the normal healing process Nerves take time to wake up and when they do they can become very irritable and cause pain sensations To your main question It is not possible to get gallstones in your liver Gallstones can only occur within the gallbladder itself or within the duct of the gallbladder There are no similar stones that form in the liver because the liver is simply made differently from the gallbladder Like I say it wouldnt hurt to have your symptoms checked out to make sure everythings healing properly Wishing you well Im sorry youre suffering with this Dental pain is the worst Your best bet for dental problems is to see a dentist But if youre in pain and have facial swelling or a fever then an emergency room usually will treat you If you have a regular dentist it would be worth calling the regular office number to find out if your dentist offers emergency or afterhours services Many dentists do If not you might check online to see if any dentists in your area offer emergency treatment I wish you all the best with this Well Im not going to sugarcoat it A isnt the most pleasant experience youll ever have On the other hand its not as painful as say a big incision in your abdomen Based on feedback from male friends who have had a cystoscopy I can tell you they describe the discomfort of the procedure as pinching and pressure They say its not so bad they felt they would have preferred sedation especially since the procedure only takes a few minutes According to my friends the discomfort lasts about an hour or so but theres no pain or burning on urination afterwards For the  you probably will have a urinary foley catheter placed and then your bladder will be filled with fluid In my experience as a nurse many men have told me the sensation of having a catheter placed was quite uncomfortable Those who could relax and focus their attention elsewhere seemed to tolerate the procedure better And that is my advice to you As much as possible focus your attention on your breathing Take long slow deep breaths Focus on making your navel belly button rise and fall It may sound wackadoodle but this relaxation technique really does work Also try to hold a mental image in your mind of you walking out of the clinic getting into your car and driving home This will help remind you the discomfort is only temporary and soon will be over with I know youll breeze through these procedures just fine Wishing you well Im sorry to hear youre experiencing this I hope you feel better soon Unfortunately its impossible to say whats going on without a physical exam and possibly other tests such as an Xray or MRI You dont say what your age is but its important to remember men can get  just like women Among many possible causes for your pain is a stress fracture of the pelvis due to osteoporosis Of course many other conditions could be contributing to the pain youre experiencing Your best bet is to get an examination by a medical professional You can start with your primary care provider He or she will guide you toward appropriate treatment if necessary Best wishes to you Im not sure from your question if youve been diagnosed with gallbladder disease or if youre selfdiagnosing Its important to know Gallstones can be very painful If stones accumulate or block the bile duct must be performed to remove the gallbladder It is possible to live a long happy life without your gallbladder If you only your pain is due to problems with your gallbladder you should get a physical examination to rule out other possible causes of the pain Many conditions can mimic the pain of gallstones so its important to get an accurate diagnosis If your skin begins to turn yellowish you should seek emergency medical treatment as this can be a sign of a bile duct blockage Im sorry youre experiencing pain in your abdomen Thats never fun Wishing you well Yes this could be a symptom of heart trouble While some women do get the classic crushing or squeezing pain at the midchest shortness of breath lightheadedness anxiety other women have such as pain at the midback shoulder breast or arm This pain usually is described as severe rather than uncomfortable however If you suspect you are having a heart attack please seek immediate medical attention by dialing 911 Regarding  specifically the symptoms are the same in women as in men discomfort burning or aching in the chest back neck throat or jaw It is frequently mistaken for indigestion If you take antacids or other antiindigestion medications and dont get relief it could be a sign of angina pectoris This should be evaluated by a medical provider as angina is a sign of coronary artery disease I hope you feel better soon and that your symptoms are nothing more than acid reflux Thats a very interesting question I certainly think this warrants an investigation My initial reaction is that a pin in the bone shouldnt cause any problems no matter how long it stays in But my second reaction was that I dont know and you may not either exactly what type of pin was inserted Was it a screw into the bone A rod running the length of the bone We know for example that screws used to repair hip fractures can cause pain years later either from irritation to the surrounding tissues or due to arthritis Its not impossible the same could be true with your arm So Id suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider He or she can do an initial evaluation and if necessary refer you to a specialist Hope you feel better soon Mesenteric artery stenosis sounds like a specific condition but really the term just refers to the narrowing of a particular major artery in the body You can get stenosis narrowing of any artery due to plaque cholesterol buildup Three arteries known as the mesenteric arteries supply oxygenrich blood to structures in the abdomen including the intestines If one of these arteries becomes narrowed due to plaque buildup it can cause oxygen deprivation ischemia to various tissues in the abdomen The symptoms of this may vary from person to person and could include generalized abdominal pain diarrhea vomiting and pain after eating Just because your aunt has mesenteric artery stenosis doesnt mean you might get it even though you have hypertension Its kind of like saying My aunt has chronic constipation and I eat food so Im afraid I also might get chronic constipation Well you might But if you do it wont have anything to do with the fact your aunt has it I hope this helps set your mind at ease You should however do everything possible to manage your hypertension Lose weight eat a lowsalt diet and exercise regularly Wishing you well Im sorry to hear your motherinlaw is going through this but Im glad she had glaucoma ruled out Severe should not be ignored Eye pain generally is not a symptom of agerelated  Id suggest your motherinlaw make an appointment to see an ophthalmologist as distinct from an optometrist to have this evaluated An ophthalmologist is a medical doctor MD who is specially trained to deal with highlevel eye problems such as trauma glaucoma and other serious eye diseases I wish you both all the best You definitely need to see a doctor about this as soon as possible If you are a woman this could be something benign like  but it also could be symptoms of heart attack Many people are familiar with the classic signs of an acute heart attack crushing or squeezing chest pain that may radiate down the left arm shortness of breath etc But heart attacks also can last only a few moments such as what youre describing You dont want to take any chances with this especially if you have other risk factors for a heart attack such as obesity high cholesterol a sedentary lifestyle and so on Please take care and get checked out as soon as possible Lightcolored gums can be a sign of several conditions so you may want to have them checked out by a medical professional Youre right that pale gums can signal anemia Instead of racing to that conclusion and selfmedicating however it would be best to get a diagnostic blood test Usually an infection in the gums is signaled by angry red tissue instead of pale tissue Also an infection usually would be localized to the immediate area It wouldnt affect the entirety of your gums Its also possible that your gums arent that pale at all Your new focus on your wisdom tooth coming in may have led you to examine your gums more frequently They may always have been pale but you didnt notice it until you started looking at them recently At any rate your best bet is to see a dentist or health care provider if your pale gums are bothering you Take care Im very sorry youre going through this Unbearable pain needs to be addressed because it affects a persons entire life If youve been taking the medication for a couple of weeks or more and still have this excruciating pain then its time to revisit the doctor to let him or her know the medication isnt helping Of the medications you listed only the Lyrica generic name pregabalin is prescribed for pain If it is not helping you should talk with your doctor about what other options are available for treatment I hope you get relief soon Im sorry to hear your husbands going through this It sure doesnt sound like much fun Obviously Im not a dentist so my experience with dental issues is somewhat limited I do think it would be odd not to treat a bona fide which is an infection with antibiotics but maybe this is a legitimate dental protocol I really dont know for sure If I were in your shoes I would take my husbands temperature every four hours with a thermometer none of this handtotheforehead stuff or you look feverish Get a good thermometer and take his temperature If hes running a fever its time for a trip to urgent care Fever often is a sign of infection For the bleeding one thing your husband can try is biting down firmly but not real real hard on a damp teabag or damp gauze for about 5 minutes Then gently remove it and see if the major bleeding has stopped If not try with a fresh tea bag A clot should form in the socket where the tooth was removed If this doesnt happen a painful condition called   can occur Extracting a wisdom tooth can be very painful If the dentist did not prescribe a pain reliever your husbands in a tough spot If hes been taking ibuprofen Motrin or aspirin this could be why hes still bleeding He could take acetaminophen Tylenol if hes not allergic to it This might help control the pain In any case if you have serious concerns about the situation either call the dentist or go to urgent care Wishing you well Im sorry to hear youre going through this Youre obviously anxious to get a diagnosis and I dont blame you That said theres not much value in speculating about what may be causing your symptoms Your doctor is ordering appropriate tests and you have a complicated case due to your other conditions I know its hard to wait not to mention scary but waiting is your best bet Trust your doctor Hang in there I hope you get answers soon The short answer is No A hernia by definition is an opening in the muscles that allows other tissue often the intestinal wall to protrude This opening or tear in the muscle will not heal itself In fact attempting to strengthen the abdominal muscles could backfire and make the hernia worse An umbilical hernia is not uncommon even in an adult However its worth getting an accurate diagnosis from a health care provider Your provider also can tell you whether or not youd benefit from a surgical repair of the hernia or not Hope this helps Yes these things definitely could be related and you should seek immediate medical attention by calling 911 The symptoms you describe could indicate an that requires immediate treatment Do not delay I realize your question was posted 12 hours ago so perhaps youve already seen a medical professional If the symptoms have subsided you still need to seek medical attention Best wishes to you  occurs when a blood clot travels to the lung and blocks an artery Generally speaking when you have a pulmonary embolism also called a PE you know it Patients generally experience a sudden severe shortness of breath severe chest pain and feelings of doom Its not uncommon for someone with PE to say I think Im going to die If you are experiencing chest pain that comes and goes you should be evaluated by a health care professional Many things can cause intermittent chest pain but of course you want to rule out any sort of heart problem Everyone should know the  which can be similar to those of a PE except the shortness of breath usually is much more severe with PE A pulmonary embolism is a lifethreatening medical emergency If you suspect PE always call 911 immediately Hope this helps My advice Go back to your doctor Sure heart problems are rare in someone your age and at your level of fitness But that doesnt mean this doesnt warrant further investigation When you return to the doctor be prepared to ask these questions What could be causing such severe pain because 85 out of 10 is severe on any scale What diagnostic tests are available to me Should I see a cardiologist Could this be sickle cell disease  May I get a complete metabolic panel just to make sure theres nothing weird going on Whats the worstcase scenario Whats the bestcase scenario Sometimes just knowing the questions to ask is helpful If you arent satisfied with the answers your pediatrician gives you such as I dont know whats causing that feel free to consult another health care provider You deserve answers to your questions You have legitimate symptoms I wish you all the best This is a good question Most people associate botulinum toxin one common brand is BOTOX with celebrities and cosmetic wrinkle reduction However botulinum toxin serves real medical purposes too and one of them is pain relief Here is an article about botulinum toxin injections to  Botulinum toxin is a powerful muscle relaxant In general it takes five to seven days for botulinum toxin to fully take effect Its definitely not a product that takes effect instantly Since you only received your injections two days ago Id advise you wait at least another week to allow the medication to work You dont say what type of pain you got BOTOX injections for You need to know that botulinum toxin for pain relief doesnt work in all people And in some people it only works after receiving several rounds of injections usually about three months apart Hope this helps It sounds like youre saying your friend was removed from life support and if so Im very sorry for your loss Im sure the family did not make the decision to remove the ventilator without a lot of input from the doctors caring for your friend A family cannot unilaterally decide to withdraw life support Ultimately that decision is made mutually between the care team and the loved ones Regarding pain You may not be able to feel pain if youre unconscious but pain causes a physical reaction in the body This is one way we can tell if an unconscious patient is experiencing pain As you noted high blood pressure and agitation can be symptoms of pain I encountered this frequently as a recovery room nurse when my patients were still asleep after surgery but obviously were experiencing a pain response To set your mind at ease about the withdrawal of life support let me just say some brain injuries cannot be overcome Brain tissue cannot repair itself the way most other body tissues can For example you get a cut on your finger and eventually skin cells fill in the gap It doesnt work like that in the brain or the heart for that matter When brain cells die they are dead forever If your friends doctors felt he was brain dead it means he never would have recovered no matter how much time he was given Again Im sorry for your loss Im sorry to hear youre going through this Unfortunately a number of things could cause the symptoms youre describing Id suggest you keep working with your health care provider to find a cause for these symptoms Even though youve undergone some testing already if you dont have a diagnosis you need to keep pushing Dont give up on this A number of conditions that could cause the symptoms you describe can take a long time to be diagnosed Its important you work closely with your health care providers to get all possible testing done in order to arrive at a diagnosis Also sometimes tests need to be repeated and the results compared to previous tests in order to get an accurate diagnosis I suggest you keep copies of all your own medical records including films from CT MRI etc in case you have to change doctors or opt to get a second opinion Again Im sorry youre dealing with this and hope your care team can arrive at a diagnosis and some treatment options soon All the best to you Im sorry to hear youre going through this It sounds very unpleasant First just to clarify an IUD is an intrauterine device Its an implant that goes inside the uterus I think what you meant to say is you had birth control implants rods removed from your upper arm You dont say when you had this procedure done but its not unexpected you would experience bruising possibly considerable bruising since the inside of the upper arm is a very tender area and pain for the same reason You also would experience swelling which is a normal response to having a minor procedure like the rod removal Its also not abnormal for the stitches to ooze for the first 24 hours after you have the birth control rods taken out Your health care provider should have given you some instructions about what to do regarding the stitches sutures Generally speaking you should be able to Gently cleanse the stitches using lukewarm water and plain soap pat dry Apply an antibacterial ointment such as triple antibiotic ointment or Neosporin to the sutures as long as youre not allergic to any of the ingredients in the ointment Many people fear any wound will become infected so they monitor closely for what they believe is pus coming from the wound Usually any fluid you see oozing from a wound is not pus but is simply part of the natural healing process It takes several days for an infection to develop so if you just had the birth control rods removed today it would be virtually impossible for you to be experiencing symptoms of an infection where the rods were removed If it has been more than three days since you had the rods removed and youre experiencing symptoms the next step is to take your temperature using a thermometer  If you have a fever over 101F then you may indeed have an infection You should seek medical treatment In general you can elevate your arm apply ice packs and take an overthecounter pain reliever to help ease the situation At any rate if youre concerned about whats going on you should contact the health care provider who removed the birth control rods He or she is in the best position to advise you how to proceed Wishing you well You ask a very good question and I wish I had a very good answer Unfortunately a very early term miscarriage might be almost impossible to detect At only one to two weeks the embryo is so small it may easily be shed with the lining of the uterus and look exactly like a normal period Your home pregnancy test also could have given a false poairicw which is rare but happens With the conflicting test results you report I would think you probably were not pregnant You dont say if you arewere using hormonal birth control like the pill but this also could cause problems with both the home pregnancy test reading and the weird oneday period Nevertheless if you were hoping for a baby and believe you lost it I am very sorry for your loss Sometimes the medical facts matter less than our feelings If you are feeling sad about possibly losing a baby dont hesitate to lean on friends for support You have a right to grieve Wishing you well If the symptoms dont go away within a few hours or if they get worse I suggest you go to the emergency room or an urgent care facility or call a nurse advice line Shakiness or tremor is a known side effect of  so this symptom should go away as the level of gabapentin in your system goes down If you continue to experience shakiness after taking gabapentin in the future you should notify your doctor immediately That said there is no reason you cant take both the gabapentin and the lortab at the same time Although both are painkillers they work in entirely different ways Without getting too technical gabapentin works directly on nerves at the synapses Lortab hydrocodone plus acetaminophen is a narcotic with Tylenol that works primarily by binding to opioid receptors within the central nervous system Because these two drugs work differently you generally can take them at the same time without any adverse interactions between the two However you should verify this information with a pharmacist It also wouldnt hurt to report your tremor side effect to your pharmacist so it can be noted on your profile I hope your shakiness calms down soon and I wish you all the best Im sorry to hear this It obviously distresses you and that alone warrants further investigation You say you have no medical problems but have you had this confirmed by a gynecologist The natural decline of hormones both female and male in a woman can cause a decline in sex drive A gynecologist can determine if this is causing your decreased desire or not and provide treatment if necessary If theres absolutely nothing wrong physically then Id suggest you consult a counselor A psychotherapist who specializes in sexual issues may help you figure out why your sex drive has declined Dont be embarrassed to seek this kind of help A womans sex drive is very complicated A skilled therapist may be able to help you sort things out You also might want to check out to connect with other women who are experiencing the same thing Wishing you all the best Im sorry youre going through this and havent received a timely answer With luck the immediate crisis has resolved itself Some things to consider If your brother is single has he designated a person to be his powerofattorney POA This crucial document designates someone to make decisions on his behalf should he become physically or mentally incapacitated Perhaps you could become his POA If your brother becomes increasingly irrational or delusional be aware you can call the police to try to have him committed to a mental health facility against his will If he represents a threat to himself or others he can be committed to a treatment facility If you have not already set him up with a primary care provider perhaps you could do so This would be a great first step in getting his physical and mental health evaluated You may wish to consult a lawyer to find out what if any your legal responsibilities are to your brother Some states place legal and financial responsibilities on relatives of an individual who cant or wont care for himself You may want to investigate what the law is in the state of California While its great you are helping care for your brother you need to know if you could be held legally liable for anything irrational he might do If you cant afford an attorney you may be able to avail yourself of free or lowcost legal aid Try doing an internet search for free legal aid and your city name If your brother simply will not accept your help he is free to do so as long as hes not a danger to himself or others This can be difficult to accept Feel free to seek help and psychotherapy for yourself to help in dealing with your feelings toward your brother Acquaint yourself with local crisis hotline phone numbers That way if something happens suddenly youre prepared Youre a wonderful sibling to help your brother I wish you both the best Im sorry to hear youre going through this It is indeed very painful In plain English a superior labral tear is a torn tendon at the top of your shoulder joint where the head of your arm bone meets the socket of your shoulder It is not an uncommon problem Eventually the tendon probably will heal on its own Tendons and ligaments tend to heal VERY slowly because they have poor blood supplies The bad news is it literally can take months for these tears to heal In the meantime you want to make sure you dont lose range of motion in your shoulder You should consult your doctor for specific advice on whether or not you should be doing rangeofmotion exercises or not If possible avoid moving your shoulder in a way that causes pain Basically that movement is aggravating the tear which will make it heal more slowly Ice wont help because the soothing comfort of cold cant reach deeply enough into the shoulder joint If youre not allergic to ibuprofen you can take that for pain Again sorry youre going through this Wishing you well Im sorry your mom is going through this She did the right thing in consulting a doctor However thats not the end of the story The fact she continues to have symptoms without a diagnosis means she should go back to her doctor Many conditions can cause the symptoms you list Some of those conditions can take a long time and a lot of testing to diagnose If you didnt get an acceptable answer from your mothers health care provider before its time to go back and get an explanation If you dont feel your mothers health care provider is giving you an adequate explanation for her symptoms then you can consider getting a second opinion I hope this helps You ask a good question Many people have concerns about going under general anesthesia even when theyre in good health Certainly a generally healthy 73year old man would not be at much higher risk of complications from general anesthesia than anyone else However that doesnt matter because the individual has stated he doesnt want to go under general anesthesia And you know what That might be OK Depending on how bad the umbilical hernia is he might be able to have the procedure done under sedation  much like what you get when you have a colonoscopy Its enough IV medication to keep you comfortably drowsy but no breathing tube is involved and waking up generally is quick The patient might also be able to have the umbilical hernia repaired under just local anesthesia numbing injections to the area if the hernia isnt too severe I suggest the gentleman discuss his concerns with a surgeon If one surgeon wont consider doing the repair under sedation or local anesthesia feel free to consult others It may not sound logical but you might consider consulting a plastic and reconstructive surgeon because they have other tissuenumbing methods at their disposal that might work well for someone whos reluctant to undergo general anesthesia I hope the gentleman gets his umbilical hernia repaired because its usually a pretty straightforward procedure and his quality of life likely will be greatly improved afterwards Wishing you well Im sorry youre dealing with this It sounds very uncomfortable Any time symptoms are getting worse instead of better I believe its a good idea to get medical attention Go back to your doctor and let him or her know the situation is going downhill It also would be helpful if you used an oral thermometer to take your temperature a couple of times a day not when you first wake up If youre running a fever this is valuable information to report to your doctor Many things can cause the symptoms youre describing from appendicitis to an ovarian cyst to a piece of hard stool thats temporarily stuck in the bowel Only another physical examination and perhaps some additional testing can help lead to a diagnosis Best wishes to you Im sorry you experience this It doesnt sound pleasant thats for sure Whenever a patient describes pain with words like jolt of electricity we tend to think in terms of nerve pain Only a physical examination and perhaps some testing like Xrays or MRI can say for sure whats going on with your neck That said I would suspect you occasionally pinch a nerve when you turn your head suddenly This type of can occur if you have a spinal disc that is slowly collapsing or if you have some arthritis in the vertebrae spinal bones of your neck While I dont think this situation is an emergency I would suggest you get this checked out by a health care provider soon Catching spine problems early usually results in a better outcome You can start with a visit to your primary care provider and he or she can get the ball rolling Hope this helps Im sorry to hear about your accident Ouch I certainly would suggest you get this checked out It sounds like you might have a  Concussions can vary from mild to severe If youre having pain around one eye my concern would be that you damaged some of the delicate structures around your eye socket That definitely deserves to be checked by a medical professional as well as getting an assessment of your head injury in general Because this happened over a week ago I dont necessarily think you need to go to an emergency room Id suggest phoning your primary care provider and explaining the situation so they work you in as soon as possible If they cant get you in within a day or two then I guess Id suggest you head for an urgent care I mean on the one hand this doesnt sound like an emergency anymore but on the other hand it probably needs to get checked out sooner rather than later Just for future reference if you ever hit your head hard enough to black out even for a moment or if you experience dizziness fuzzy memory nausea or any of the other  you should go to the emergency room I wish you all the best and hope you feel better soon Im sorry to hear youre going through this Pain certainly is never fun Unfortunately its impossible to say whats causing this pain Diagnosing this requires a physical examination and possibly other testing Several conditions could cause the pain youre describing including simple constipation Specifically if youre over age 50 and have ever smoked if you would describe the pain as a tearing sensation I would not delay getting this checked out There is a rare condition called that can cause the type of pain youre describing and this would require immediate attention from a medical professional If youre under age 50 and this pain doesnt go away on its own within a few days you might make an appointment with your primary care provider to have it checked out I hope you feel better soon This is an interesting question Thanks for asking Its impossible to give you a definitive answer without having more information For example when you say brain pain do you mean a headache Is the person getting the headache a man or a woman What is the age of the person One possibility that immediately springs to mind is high blood pressure During sex especially during vigorous sex blood pressure can rise This rise in pressure can cause a temporary headache The headache could begin during sexual intercourse or afterwards If this happens frequently or if the person experiencing the headache is using a medication for erectile dysfunction such as Viagra or Cialis it would be wise to speak to your health care professional about the issue Please dont be embarrassed to seek medical attention about this issue Trust me health care providers have the utmost respect for patients who are willing to be open and honest about their health needs Take care This is something that deserves to be checked out right away by a health care professional especially if your vision is changed or limited in your right eye Its possible to rupture a blood vessel in the white of the eye called  This can be triggered by something as simple as sneezing Occasionally there is pain involved as well as mild swelling of the eyelid Its not possible to diagnose your eye problem in a forum like this because you need someone to conduct a physical examination to see whats going on Chances are youre experiencing a subconjunctival hemmorhage which usually is benign doesnt cause any harm But youll want a health care provider to tell you that in person Good luck to you Im sorry youre experiencing this You need to get it checked out right away If the antacids arent reducing the pain then it may not be caused by heartburn Angina is caused by a reduction in oxygen delivery to the heart muscle which causes pain Do not try to selfdiagnose angina You need to seek professional care as soon as possible Take care Im sorry youre going through this Pain is never fun I would urge you to get in to see your doctor as soon as possible What youre describing does not sound like a migraine at all but it could possibly be an ear infection In rare cases an untreated ear infection can move into the bone behind the ear This normally happens in children and is called  No matter what the underlying cause of this pain is the fact its ongoing and seems to be getting worse means you need medical attention If you cant get an office visit its probably time for a visit to urgent care Feel better Im sorry youre going through this It sounds very unpleasant A number of things could be going on here but its not likely your gallbladder is involved The gallbladder is located on the right side of the body near the bottom of your rib cage Its doubtful the gallbladder could refer any pain to the left shoulder I can think of any number of reasons youd be having this pain from a slight fracture to a injury to an aggravated  The only way to find out whats going on is to see a medical professional for an examination and possibly other testing like an Xray Id suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider PCP to have this evaluated It would be helpful to evaluate it when its actually flaring up but that might be impossible to time Even if youre not having a pain episode your PCP might be able to come to some conclusion as to the cause of this pain and get you started on treatment Best of luck to you The type of pain you describe certainly is common after endoscopy and Im sorry youre experiencing it Generally speaking throat lozenges or any kind of hard candy sugarfree if you have diabetes can soothe the irritation of the throat after endoscopy You also may use an overthecounter pain reliever such as acetaminophen Tylenol ibuprofen Motrin Advil or naproxyn Aleve Keep in mind ibuprofen and naproxyn are blood thinners that can promote bleeding so you may want to avoid those for a few days after your endoscopy Also if you take acetaminophen be sure to follow the label instructions Taking too much acetaminophen can damage your liver Do not exceed the maximum daily dose Hope this helps Im sorry to hear youre suffering Tendinitis can be very painful refers to the inflammation of a tendon When it occurs in the wrist its often from repetitive motion or overuse  though a sports injury could cause wrist tendinitis as well Its not uncommon for the pain of tendinitis to linger for months However since its been a long time since your diagnosis I think youd be welladvised to return to the doctor to have the situation reassessed Tendinitis cant turn into something else so you can rest easy on that count If the brace isnt helping and youre relying on NSAID pain relievers frequently though its time to go back to the health care provider for a recheck I hope you feel better soon Im sorry to hear about your dads cancer but how lucky he is to have you to help him through this It sounds like youve been doing a great job managing your dads constipation As you know opioid narcotic pain medications can cause constipation The stool softeners were a good idea as was the MiraLax If the MiraLax was working but then caused diarrhea you may need to keep playing with how much and how often to use it in order to achieve the desired result If your dad is experiencing constipation you can give him the MiraLax even if it means youre off schedule with it Dont get stuck in a schedule if its not working Because your dad has colon cancer specifically and hes now experiencing problems with bowel movements it would be a good idea to make an appointment to see his health care provider This increase in constipation along with the cramping could be related to the disease progression and should be evaluated by his primary care provider or oncologist I wish you all the very best as you go through this journey Hang in there Sorry to hear youre experiencing this It must be uncomfortable Its really impossible to say what could be causing this without a physical examination Your best bet is to make an appointment with your primary care provider and let him or her take a look at your toe Because the range of possible causes is so wide and depends a lot on your physical history medications and so on only your health care provider can provide a diagnosis I hope youre able to get this resolved quickly Its hard to say whats causing this Although outwardly everything may look healed thats not necessarily the case inside It takes about 6 weeks for scar tissue to become as strong as suture Its possible you popped a small suture during stretching which is now causing you a little pain Or its possible this is simply residual pain from the surgery Its not uncommon for nerves that were cut during surgery to start waking up around this timeframe You might expect onandoff pain from this nerve healing process for several months If youve been doing vigorous exercising Id advise you to speak with your doctor Its possible you worked out too hard to quickly This probably wouldnt cause any serious or lingering health problems but its worth investigating If you havent been cleared by your surgeon to exercise then you should stop until you have clearance Wish I could give you a better answer but its impossible to say whats going on here without a physical exam If the pain persists or if you suddenly spike a fever over 101F you definitely need to seek medical attention Wishing you all the best Im sorry to hear youre in pain Thats no fun Well yes its possible you tore the ligament again Or you may simply have strained it Or you could have a small fracture in your foot or ankle My point is that your best bet is to see your primary health care provider for an exam and possibly an Xray Thats the only way to tell for sure whats going on here At the same time your provider should be able to get you some pain treatment which is important I hope you feel better soon So sorry to hear youre going through this Pain in the left arm and the back is always concerning in terms of whether it could be heart related If you are a woman please read about the possible symptoms of a heart attack which can include pain in the left shoulder and back along with weakness on that side If you are a man or a woman and are experiencing any of  please get checked out by a health care provider right away Chest pain discomfort or heaviness Pain or discomfort radiating to the back jaw or throat Sweating nausea vomiting or dizziness Extreme weakness anxiety or shortness of breath Rapid or irregular heartbeats Now all that said its also possible youre suffering from a pinched nerve or muscle strain Nonetheless if the pain persists gets worse or if you begin experiencing other symptoms please see a health care provider as soon as possible Im sorry to hear youre coping with this You received good advice at the time of the injury Most do get resorbed by the body over time However a small percentage do not Instead they can become encapsulated and feel like a hard painful lump beneath the skin Its time for you to have this hematoma reevaluated Its possible youre one of the unlucky few whose hematoma became encapsulated If thats the case the usual treatment is a minor surgery to remove it Wishing you well Im sorry you and your mother are going through this Its very difficult to watch a loved one deteriorate Although your mother doesnt trust doctors I think you should consider taking her to a good primary care provider for a complete assessment of her health and all her medications If your mom doesnt trust doctors maybe try to find a nurse practitioner This alone may set your mothers mind at ease Your mother certainly deserves to have her pain controlled to the extent possible and to have her other symptoms addressed I can think of a number of conditions none of them related to pain pill use that could cause the symptoms of falling and disorientation including a urinary tract infection Thats why I think you should consider getting your mom to a medical professional Please dont give up just because youve made the rounds of health care providers for years It can take a long time to find a provider whos a good fit and takes a true interest in the patients health and wellbeing Also Id suggest you make sure to take care of yourself This sounds like a stressful situation and you dont want your own health to suffer Wishing you and your mom all the best Im sorry to hear youre going through this In my book anything that keeps a person awake all night from discomfort is worth treating Unfortunately its impossible to say whats going on with your elbow without performing a physical exam Several things could be causing your pain but one thing that comes to mind is tendinitis due to overuse Sometimes this is called   I dont think what youre describing is caused by medication Like I say one possibility is an overuse injury If thats what the problem is at least it can be treated But my main advice to you is to see a doctor to have this checked out You can start with your primary care provider I wish you all the best in finding relief When talking with people your age who complained of chest pain I used to always say Its highly unlikely you have a heart problem if thats what youre thinking But these days when many people are obese and dont exercise a heart problem in a 19yearold isnt outside the realm of possibility Im not assuming youre obese or that you dont exercise Im just saying a lot of 19yearolds fall into that category Its never a bad idea to get checked out by a medical professional It will put your mind at ease and probably provide an answer for what is causing this pain I can tell you its not uncommon for young women to experience  In fact many young women land in the emergency room thinking theyre having a heart attack only to be diagnosed with costochondritis In this benign condition chest pain derives from inflammation of the rib cartilage You should not selfdiagnose this however Better to get a professional medical opinion Wishing you well Im sorry to hear youre in pain Uncontrolled pain can negatively affect almost every aspect of life If youre in chronic pain that is not controlled by the use of overthecounter medications like Aleve Id suggest you see a medical professional to find out exactly whats causing the pain and what medications may be appropriate for you to take If youre taking naproxen due to a shortterm illness or injury thats causing pain and the naproxen alone isnt controlling the pain then Id suggest you consult a pharmacist to learn whether or not its all right to add something like acetaminophen Tylenol to the mix Its impossible for me to give you accurate information in a forum like this one because the answer depends on your medical history and any other medications you may be taking Your pharmacist or health care provider will have that information and be able to give you better guidance Feel better soon Id suggest you see a doctor about this You can start with your primary care provider and he or she will refer you to an orthopedic doctor if necessary You dont say exactly what kind of surgery you had in 2009 Im thinking it was an arthroscopy to remove pieces of the meniscus If this is the case and youre experiencing new or worsening symptoms youd be well served to see a health care provider I wouldnt necessarily recommend wearing a knee brace You could reduce your range of motion and have a hard time getting it back The only way to truly solve this problem is to get an examination by a health care provider He or she can discuss with you all the various options from physical therapy to surgery that can help solve your knee problem Good luck So sorry to hear youre dealing with this Pain is never fun The symptoms youre describing could be caused by several things ranging from injury striking your hand against an object for example to repetitive motion strain such as from using a video game controller for hours on end Treating the symptoms may be based in part on what is causing them so your best bet is to get checked out by your primary care provider He or she will evaluate the problem possibly order some tests Xray for example and then develop an appropriate treatment plan for you So while this certainly isnt an emergency situation it would be a good idea to have this problem checked out before it gets any worse Good luck to you Im sorry youre going through this Few things hurt as much as back pain Just to clarify Xrays look for injuries of the bone and surrounding tissue In other words an Xray of your back could provide a preliminary indication of a fractured vertebra or a herniated disk In your case the Xray showed no injuries of this type which is great news Back pain isnt always caused by injury to the spine or spinal nerves In fact a major source of back pain is actually muscle spasm Back spasms can cause very severe pain I suspect this may be what youre experiencing If the pain went away when you were on light duty and then returned when you went back to your regular duties it may indicate you are not using correct  You should pay close attention to your posture as you lift and bend Always avoid bending and twisting as the spine is not made to accommodate this type of movement You also may benefit from  These exercises combined with stretching can strengthen your back muscles and make them more supple This will help alleviate back pain from overuse And dont forget your core strengthening your abdominal muscles helps relieve back pain and improves posture If the pain continues go back to the doctor and ask about physical therapy to help you strengthen your back and core As a last resort you might consider antispasmodic medications However those can make you drowsy and have other side effects Wishing you well Sadly I cant answer your question Youll have to keep in close contact with her medical providers for that But I did want to extend my thoughts to and your family and especially your sister at this difficult time I wish you all the best and hope for a positive outcome Any time someone reports symptoms on just one side of the body unilaterally it raises a few red flags You could be describing something as simple as an inflamed lymph node or as complex as cancer Theres no way to tell without doing a physical examination I suggest you make an appointment with your primary health care provider to start with He or she will make an initial evaluation and diagnosis and then refer you to a specialist if necessary I dont want you to be alarmed about this Chances are these symptoms dont point to anything ominous But why not get checked out just to be safe Wishing you all the best Im sorry to hear youre going through this It must be frustrating to go through a major surgery and then continue to experience pain issues If your orthopedic surgeon suggested you get a second opinion Id advise you to do just that Its possible a different surgeon with different experience in joint replacement will be able to identify the source of your pain and treat it A number of conditions could cause the pain you describe If you have a fever 101F nausea or feeling like you might be coming down with the flu Id suggest you call your orthopedist as soon as possible as these may be signs of an infection Otherwise Id suggest you get that second opinion I hope you find relief soon If you suspect you might have a blood clot you should make an appointment with your doctor as soon as possible You have a good grasp of the primary of DVT but just because you dont have the redness and heat doesnt mean its not a DVT Of course pain in one calf muscle doesnt necessarily mean you DO have a DVT either Generally DVT is first assessed using a noninvasive ultrasound test This imaging test will give your doctor a good look at your veins to see if one of them may be blocked or partially blocked If you do have a blood clot in your leg your doctor may treat it with medications Best wishes getting this sorted out If you have ever been told you have an and are experiencing abdominal pain then you should seek immediate medical treatment Here are the  If you have sudden severe abdominal pain especially if its a tearing sensation in the upperright quadrant of the abdomen an extreme drop in blood pressure as evidenced by dizziness paleness and a sudden increase in your heart rate or sudden confusion and weakness you should call 911 immediately Otherwise call your cardiologist right away and tell them your AAA may be symptomatic They should get you an appointment quickly You are right to rule out AAA as soon as possible I wish you all the best The best answer to your question is this Consult your physician Youre smart to think about the blood thinning properties of overthecounter pain relievers given youre on coumadin warfarin Generally speaking its not wise to take any NSAID  such as aspirin naproxyn or ibuprofen  when youre taking warfarin or another anticlotting drug In this case acetaminophen Tylenol is your only overthecounter option However you should ask your health care provider what to do in your specific case Everyone is different and your provider may be able to give you a prescription pain reliever that will not interact with the warfarin Wishing you well Sorry to hear youre going through this It sounds awful Many conditions could cause those symptoms One possibility is food poisoning If youre not running a fever its probably OK to wait things out to see if the symptoms get better Meanwhile try to sip water or at least take ice chips The combination of vomiting and diarrhea can cause dehydration pretty quickly If youre still sick in a day or two it probably would be wise to call your health care provider or go to an urgent care facility Hope this helps The short answer is this Whenever you have any symptoms that could be heartrelated get them checked out Your age doesnt matter Your fitness level doesnt matter Because of your youthful age the chances are good you do not have any serious heart condition But as a general rule its better to be safe than sorry Youll feel more at ease after getting checked out by a health care professional right Plus if you do have some cardiac issue the earlier you catch it the quicker it can be treated Ask your mom or dad to make an appointment for you If they are unable or unwilling to do so have a chat with your school nurse or counselor They can help you access the care you need Dont get overly concerned about this but please do get it checked out Take care Im sorry youre experiencing this Medical diagnosis and treatment can be very confusing sometimes Certainly in the neck cervical vertebrae can cause pain The pain is caused by pressure on the nerve roots where they extend from the spinal cord and through the vertebrae If the discs in your neck are degenerating becoming stiff or even collapsing this can put pressure on the nerves and cause pain Sometimes a doctor will look at pictures of your neck from an Xray or MRI and will not see any areas of nerve compression Because of this he or she will tell you you shouldnt be having any pain However its not always possible to see a compressed nerve on an Xray or MRI If youre having pain in your neck you can return to your doctor to let him or her know this Your doctor will determine what type of treatment might work best to relieve your symptoms I hope you find relief soon Sorry to hear youre going through this It sounds like you did a great job of rehabbing on your own though The shoulder is a very complex structure If in fact you did injure your rotator cuff it can take a long time to heal Aggravating the injury through usage can make the process slower However its possible the problem isnt your rotator cuff at all There are structures called   in the shoulder too These are leathery sacs of fluid that help lubricate the joint Its possible to tear or otherwise injure a bursa sac around the shoulder which can lead to the type of symptoms youre describing Or you could have injured a ligament Like I said the structure of the shoulder is very complex Whether its your rotator cuff a bursa or a ligament the main healing factor is time Obviously something about the puckshooting motion and force is aggravating your injury which may increase your healing time If the pain becomes chronic or you feel youve reinjured the shoulder then its clearly time to have the doctor look at it again After all your great work rehabbing the injury you dont want to now undo everything Hope this helps Im not sure if youre talking about surgery or some other type of treatment But since I know about surgery Ill answer regarding that thats caused by compression on a nerve root by something like a herniated disc can be effectively treated with surgery In this type of surgery the doctor often removes the disc and replaces it with a spacer and a small piece of donated bone that will cause the vertebrae to fuse together after a period of time However there are several different types of that are used to treat low back pain You and your doctor will work together to determine what the best treatment plan is for your low back pain Its important to note you may still experience pain even after surgery to decompress the spinal column in the lower back Im not sure if thats the information you were after but I hope it helps Sorry to hear youre experiencing this It sounds unpleasant Youre right It could be  It could also be something entirely different  for example can cause a tinglingprickly sensation to the toes The only way to determine for sure whats causing your symptoms is a physical examination by a health care provider And even then you might not get an answer to your question Why Because there are so many possible causes for the symptoms you describe Unless or until you experience additional symptoms a physician may not be able to pinpoint exactly whats causing the toe tingling One things for sure The only way to begin figuring this out is to see a health care provider Id suggest you start with your primary care provider Wishing you well Im so sorry youre going through this Back pain isnt fun and its nothing to fool around with When a Marine or former Marine tell me he has barely controlled back pain this tells me he needs to see a doctor Many back conditions could cause the symptoms youre describing from a displaced disk to a cracked vertebra The only way to find out for sure whats going on is to get a physical examination and some testing like Xrays or MRI done Back problems rarely get better on their own so the sooner you get this treated the better I wish you all the best with this To be honest only your surgeon can answer that question I recommend you call your surgeons office and ask to speak to his or her nurse for guidance In general any type of surgery involves cutting through the nerves of the skin That means its not unusual for the skin area around an incision to feel numb for a period of time after surgery Eventually those tiny skin nerves will find new pathways to the brain and the numbness will go away I wish you all the best in getting answers from your health care provider about this Im sorry to hear youre going through this Chronic can be more than a painful nuisance It can cause other health problems such as a bowel obstruction The bleeding you see after you have a bowel movement may be caused by  especially if the blood is bright red in color However any type of bleeding from the colon is worth having checked out by a medical professional Your best bet is to attack the cause of your chronic constipation Eat plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables to get needed fiber Avoid using laxatives as this can make the problem worse in a yoyo sort of way Be sure to drink plenty of water Hydration is very important for avoiding constipation I hope you find some relief soon The short answer to your question is Dont ever mix pain relievers without asking your health care provider or pharmacist A quick phone call to your pharmacy or health care providers office may give you just the answer you need In general I want to add if youre taking the narcotics morphine and percocet for postsurgical pain its a good idea to take them only as needed Understand that many narcotic pain relievers such as oxycodoneAPAP Percocet contain other medications Specifically Percocet contains acetaminophen Tylenol so you should never take extra acetaminophen with Percocet If you do so you may easily exceed the maximum daily dose of acetaminophen which can cause liver damage Id recommend you call your health care providers office and ask to speak to a nurse about this He or she can give you specific instructions about how to treat your pain Good luck So sorry to hear your husbands going through this Nagging rib pain is no fun Yes his symptoms certainly could be caused from leaning on that fence railing while fishing I hope he reeled in a big one for his trouble Since hes had all the usual heart testing and was told his heart was in good shape Im going to guess hes got a case of or an injury to the cartilage between his ribs Leaning against a sharp object such as a fence railing could cause a mild tear or irritation of the rib cartilage Rib cartilage will repair itself eventually Unfortunately it may be mighty ouchy until the healing is finished Your husband can take overthecounter pain relievers such as antiinflammatory medication like ibuprofen naproxyn or plain aspirin for the pain Hope this helps Im sorry to hear this If the pain is severe or if you begin to run a fever you should seek medical attention Determining the source of the pain can only be achieved through a physical examination Among the things that can cause the type of pain youre describing in the right abdomen upper and lower are intestinal gas appendicitis ovarian cyst constipation gallstones and many other things Thats why you should see a health care provider if additional symptoms develop or the pain gets worse I hope you feel better soon Im sorry youre going through this As a nurse I find medication management to be one of the most challenging aspects of care for both patients and providers Id suggest you make an appointment to see your primary care provider to evaluate all of your medications and symptoms Take all of your medication bottles with you to your appointment and be sure to mention any overthecounter products you take such as aspirin or vitamins Once your health care provider has all this information the two of you can work together to come up with a medication plan that works well for you Keep in mind medication management is a process you and your health care provider may need to tinker more than once with your medications before everything falls into place Good luck to you To be honest Id have this checked out Chronic can be caused by an injury like the one you describe Its even possible you suffered a small fracture At any rate the sooner you have it checked out the more effective treatment might be at heading off ongoing problems You dont need to rush to the emergency room but you might call your primary care provider for an evaluation He or she might want to take an Xray just to be sure theres no break Your provider also can give you more specific information about the prognosis Good luck to you Getting your tubes tied also called  is considered a permanent form of birth control So its unlikely youre pregnant If the pain is severe you certainly should seek medical attention to determine the cause Several conditions can cause the type of pain youre describing so an accurate diagnosis is important Once the cause of the pain is determined your health care provider can provide you with treatment options I usually recommend people first try to get an appointment with their primary care provider However if you cant get in to see your regular health care provider  or if you begin experiencing other symptoms such as a fever nausea or vomiting  then by all means head for the ER Best wishes to you Im sorry to hear youre going through this Whenever the skin andor muscle gets cut scar tissue will form This scar tissue can cause pain and an uncomfortable tightness at the incision site One thing you can try is scar massage Just literally use your fingers to massage the incision line fairly aggressively to help break down some of the scar tissue Its best to perform scar massage earlier usually starting around the 3month postsurgery mark but you might still get some relief by doing scar massage today I suggest you let your gynecologist know about this pain the next time you get a checkup too Its possible the pain feels as if its coming from the incision when its actually caused by something else vaginal dryness or another cause If thats the case then scar massage obviously wont help But you can get an opinion about what to do to help the pain Wishing you well Id say if this has been going on for several days that you should seek medical attention You may not necessarily need to rush to the emergency room but you should at least call your primary care provider Several conditions can cause the symptoms youre describing including  an which is not cancer so dont get alarmed or  Its impossible to say whats going on without getting a physical exam If you begin to exhibit any of the following symptoms then you should go to the emergency room Fever over 101F Vomiting Yellowing of eyes or skin Pain getting much worse instead of better Difficulty breathingshortness of breath I hope you feel better soon Im sorry youre going through this It sounds miserable My initial reaction is that you should make an appointment to see a medical professional Diarrhea by which I mean mostly watery stool with little to no solid waste in it lasting longer than a week is not normal for an adult Usually if diarrhea is caused by food poisoning it resolves within a few days The pain you describe in conjunction with the diarrhea also is concerning While Im not suggesting you have any type of lifethreatening condition I would suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider as soon as possible Meanwhile its crucial for you to drink plenty of fluids Because your diarrhea has been going on for so long you might also want to sip a sports drink like Gatorade Dehydration might explain why you feel so weak I wish you all the best in finding out whats causing this problem Well that sounds unpleasant Nothing like a little nagging pain to ruin ones day The problem is a lot of conditions could cause the pain youre describing Anything from gallstones to a pulled muscle If its bothering you enough your best bet is to get an exam from your primary care provider He or she can try to rule out anything serious If you spike a fever thats an entirely different matter In that case youd want to seek medical attention as soon as possible Meanwhile you might want to try to figure out if anything specifically aggravates the pain or causes it to flare up Exercise Eating Having a bowel movement Drinking alcohol These could all be important clues to help your medical provider diagnose the problem Feel better Im sorry about your accident I think you need to get this checked out by a medical professional The coldness of your hand and arm could be a sign of poor blood circulation related to your accident Poor blood circulation can lead to tissue death and other complications The only way to find out for sure if your injury is serious is to see a health care provider as soon as possible Particularly if your hand is grossly swollen a trip to an urgent care facility would probably be a good idea Take care Im sorry to hear youre going through this It sounds miserable and worrisome I want to emphasize your need to stay hydrated even if drinking water gives you nausea Maybe try drinking water at different temperatures to see if one is more palatable than another Or see if theres a vitamin water flavored water or type of sports drink you can tolerate Despite the fact youve been tested for and other conditions in the past my advice to you is to keep pursuing a cause for your symptoms Some conditions take a long time to be diagnosed such as  Sometimes tests need to be repeated periodically and the results compared in order to reach a diagnosis Its OK to be very proactive with your health care providers in pushing for additional testing or repeated tests depending on how much time has elapsed in order to get a diagnosis Id suggest keeping copies of all your lab results and imaging films Usually these can be provided to you on CDs for easy storage Youll want to keep these for new doctors you may consult and for comparison of test results over time I wish I had some magic suggestion to offer you in terms of a diagnosis but thats not the case Like I said hang in there and dont give up just because youve had a few tests done Keep going back to your providers to let them know you still have symptoms I wish you all the best Sorry youre dealing with this I definitely would have these new symptoms checked out There may be some causeeffect between the strep and the swollen painful joints or you may have developed something else entirely At any rate the sudden onset of the symptoms you describe in an otherwise healthy young female is reason enough to seek medical care right away Your best bet is to return to the urgent care facility where you received the strep test and injection because theyll have your medical records at hand Normally I wouldnt advise someone who believes they have strep throat to seek urgent care Its something that can be handled by a primary care provider Take care and best wishes The key statement in your question is this one thing that worries me Any time you are experiencing a health condition that worries you its a good enough reason to consult a medical professional Usually shaving or waxing can produce bumps so the fact your lesion is concave caves inward could indicate theres something else going on The only way to tell for sure is to have a physical examination by a health care provider He or she can either set your mind at ease or diagnose the problem to get you prompt treatment I hope this helps Your symptoms definitely warrant a visit to the doctor You might consider seeing either the orthopedic surgeon who performed your knee replacement or your primary care provider Things can and do go wrong with joint replacements of all types Pieces can break or its possible for them to become infected If you experience a fever redness and heat at the joint and continuing pain Id suggest you seek immediate medical attention Hopefully it will turn out that the pain in your knee is due to a muscle strain or overuse Only a health care provider can diagnose this so you might consider making an appointment soon Best wishes to you Im sorry to hear youre going through this Unfortunately its impossible to say what could be causing this without a physical examination I suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider as soon as possible because the earlier this problem is diagnosed the better the outlook for treating it effectively Youre doing a wonderful service in caring for a disabled child I salute you and hope you get a diagnosis soon Im sorry to hear youre going through this Anytime we have pain that doesnt go away its cause for concern Unfortunately its impossible to say what this could be without a physical exam Many conditions could cause the pain youre describing from a case of constipation to an ovarian cyst If the pain doesnt go away on its own after a few days or if you have other symptoms such as Fever Lack of bowel movement Pain that increases instead of decreasing Nausea andor vomiting Then its time to seek medical attention You can start by calling your primary care provider or if you feel the situation is urgent seek out an urgent care facility for an evaluation I hope you feel better soon Im sorry youre dealing with this The issue of methicillinresistant Streptococcus aureaus infection continues to grow as a public health concern As youve learned it can take multiple rounds of antibiotics to treat MRSA Because only the infected spot on your nose is itching I doubt what youre experiencing is a side effect of medication I guess my point is its impossible to say whats causing the itching and tingling without a physical examination If youre scheduled for followup with your health care provider you are probably safe to take a waitandsee approach with this as long as you dont develop a fever or additional symptoms increased rednessswellingheat at the infection site feeling like youre coming down with the flu  that sort of thing If you dont already have a followup appointment scheduled Id suggest making one You and your doctor want to be sure that infection is well and truly gone In the meantime be sure against spreading any possible remaining infection by washing your hands often and thoroughly not sharing towels or clothing that may have touched the infected spot and routinely disinfecting routinely touched surfaces by using antimicrobial wipes or something similar I hope this helps Im sorry youre going through this I wouldnt be too quick to selfdiagnose osteoarthritis Your knee pain could be caused by a number of conditions other than arthritis The very fact your sport involves a lot of knee twisting would lead me to suspect injury as a likely culprit for your pain issues Id suggest you have your knee checked out by a medical professional to get a diagnosis Once you know for sure what youre dealing with then you can work with your health care provider on a treatment plan that enables you to continue with your sport One thing I want to add is this Be careful about taking nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications NSAIDS like aspirin ibuprofen or naproxyn for your pain These medications have bloodthinning properties which can increase bleeding and swelling from injuries you sustain in your sport I wish you all the best Gotta love a person who admits she has a short fuse and a hot temper Id suggest you make an appointment with a medical professional for a physical examination When you push down on your shin bone and the skin stays indented that is a sign of fluid retention in the legs This symptom combined with your shortness of breath warrants a checkup It might just be that you need to cut back on salt But it could also be sort of an early warning sign of additional heart problems besides your mitral valve regurgitation It wouldnt be a bad idea to get this checked out so if it is something with your heart youve caught it early Wishing you and your temper all the best Its good of you to be aware of this potential complication of antibiotics the infection Azithromycin Zpack isnt as wellassociated with as broadspectrum antibiotics like penicillin or cephalosporins are but I still would suggest you take your daughter to the doctor for this I mean having diarrhea 10 days after finishing a course of antibiotics isnt normal and that alone warrants having it checked out Until you can get your daughter in to see the doctor this isnt something you need to go to the emergency room for be sure to keep your daughter wellhydrated I usually suggest drinking plenty of plain water with a glass of sports drink thrown in every now and then for electrolyte balance You also can water down a sports drink by half with water Mainly just fluids fluids fluids Also its crucially important your daughter washes her hands thoroughly with soap and water each time she goes to the bathroom is not affected by hand sanitizers Lots of handwashing will help keep this from spreading if it is in fact  I hope your daughter feels better soon Sorry youre experiencing this Bloating is especially uncomfortable Usually pale or claycolored stools indicate a lack of bile in the stool However the color change can also be related to consuming antidiarrheal medications like Kaopectate If your symptoms persist or get worse Id suggest you see a doctor Sometimes claycolored stool can indicate a blocked bile duct such as from a gallstone If your scelera the white parts of the eyeyball start turning yellow or your skin gets yellowish or if you spike a fever or start vomiting you should seek immediate medical attention by going to the emergency room These could be signs of a serious bile duct obstruction I hope you feel better soon I hope by now you have sought medical attention If not please do so right away if your symptoms have not improved Whenever someone describes tearing pain in the left abdomen we in the medical community start to get a little excited because this can be indicative of a serious condition called an AOA Although the pain is usually described as being in the upper left quadrant of the abdomen I would not hesitate to get this pain checked out pronto A symptomatic AOA is a medical emergency and should not be taken lightly Youre at higher risk for an AOA if you are male over age 60 and if you ever smoked in your lifetime If this describes you seek medical attention now Of course this could be a bout of severe constipation which is easily treatable But better to rule out an AOA first Meanwhile do not strain to have a bowel movement If you do have an AOA straining could cause it to rupture Im not trying to alarm you but I do want you to get this checked out as soon as possible Wishing you all the best Im sorry to hear youre going through this Facial pain can be very uncomfortable Id suggest you see a health care provider to get this checked out A number of conditions can cause the symptoms you describe including   or even an abscessed tooth I can also think of several other possibilities which is why you need to undergo a physical exam and perhaps some other testing to figure out whats causing this problem Some of these conditions are more prevalent among certain age groups or in women versus men If the pain doesnt clear up within a few days Id suggest you call your primary care physician for an appointment I hope you feel better soon This is an excellent question and Im glad you asked it Neither hydrocodone nor oxycodone contain codeine per se However all of these drugs belong to a class called  This means they share certain characteristics namely theyre all narcotics that work on opioid receptors throughout the body to block pain messages from reaching the brain This reduces our feeling of pain Most of my patients who were sensitive to codeine specifically were able to tolerate the codone family of medications quite well If you find you have intolerable adverse reactions such as vomiting to either hydrocodone or oxycodone notify your health care provider There are plenty of pain medications to choose from Your provider can help you find one that works for you Wishing you well Whenever a health situation seems to be moving toward worse instead of better on the spectrum I always advise people to contact their health care provider for followup That seems to be the case with you and the breastarmpit lumps Even if everything came back normal four months ago these new symptoms deserve to be evaluated If Im misunderstanding you and the lumps were present four months ago when you had the biopsy and aspiration you still deserve an explanation for whats causing the lumps Its not enough to tell a patient its nothing and send them away You have the right to know what these lumps are and they could be simply noncancerous fibrous tumors or even enlarged lymph nodes for several reasons to set your mind at ease to understand if you need to seek any kind of additional treatment for help managing the pain I would suggest you start again with your GP If these lumps are new he or she will want to evaluate them If the lumps existed before he or she needs to give you a better explanation of whats going on Wishing you well Well its hard to say A number of conditions could be causing the pain you describe Unless youre running a fever you probably can safely take a watchful waiting approach to see if the situation improves If you begin to run a fever you definitely should seek medical attention Lowerright quadrant pain frequently is associated with  By the way appendicitis is considered a medical emergency so if you spike a fever AND the pain gets worse youve won a ticket to the ER However many other nonemergency things could cause the pain youre describing For example a piece of hard stool could be stuck in the intestine temporarily This is a frequent cause of abdominal pain of all kinds In this case the stool eventually moves on and the pain goes away Even a pocket of intestinal gas could cause the symptoms you describe As always my usual advice in any medical situation is this If things start moving toward worse instead of better see your health care provider Meanwhile get a thermometer dont rely on whether or not you feel hot to the touch or anything of that sort monitor your temperature every four hours is fine and just keep close tabs on the situation Chances are it will clear up on its own Wishing you well Probably not The area youre describing the back of the thigh consists of a trio of muscles we call the  What youre describing sounds like a common spasm or cramp of the hamstring This can happen for various reasons  or no reason at all The hamstring would be an uncommon place for a to arise particularly in the absence of any other contributing factors such as recent joint replacement surgery Muscle cramps in general can signal dehydration or even a mild potassium deficiency so you could try drinking more water or eating a banana assuming your not allergic to see if that helps the situation If the cramping doesnt clear up on its own you certainly can put a call in to your primary health care provider for an appointment to have this evaluated Hope this helps Well this certainly warrants being checked out by a medical professional I mean everyone goes through occasional constipation cramping and even some bright red blood in the toilet Im talking about a hemorrhoid flareup but your symptoms sound more severe than usual Severe rectal bleeding with clots Yeah Id get that checked out Its probably not an emergency situation but Id put a call in to my primary care provider for an appointment Meanwhile it would help your health care provider if youd keep a log of what you eat when you eat it and how your bowels respond Also record dates and times of bowel movements consistency and how much blood you perceive or number of clots if you can count them individually You also might take a picture with your cell phone so you can show your doctor exactly whats happening with your bowel movements I hope you get this resolved soon and its nothing more than hemorrhoids Aw Im sorry for your little one Youre certainly describing the classic symptoms of  Luckily there are a few things you can do at home to see if you can help your child have a bowel movement However if your child goes more than a couple of days without a bowel movement you need to call your pediatrician One thing you can do is give your child some prune juice Unless your child has blood sugar problems diabetes he or she should be able to tolerate this treatment just fine Prune juice is a tried and true approach to constipation relief The best way to treat constipation is to prevent it Feed your child a healthy diet that includes plenty of fiber from whole grains fruits and vegetables Also make sure your child drinks plenty of water and gets some exercise every day These three components are crucial in preventing constipation Please do not give your child a laxative without consulting your pediatrician Dosing can be tricky with children and your pediatrician is in the best position to advise you about what laxative to use and what dosage to give Wishing you all the best Im sorry to hear this Strange pains can be concerning even if they turn out to be nothing Whenever someone complains about pain in the lower right abdomen we think first of the appendix Generally if someone has acute  the pain will increase rapidly and may be accompanied by fever and vomiting If your husband has these symptoms he needs to go to the emergency room If the pain is mild and is located low in the right abdomen a common culprit is simple constipation Its possible for a small piece of stool to get stuck in the colon temporarily which can cause pain Usually the stool gets moving again and the pain goes away Another potential cause of lowerright abdominal pain is a urinary tract or bladder infection If your husband has any trouble urinating burning blood in the urine he should get tested for a UTI Under any circumstances if his symptoms get worse or if he gets a fever he should seek medical attention Wishing you well What youre experiencing sounds awful I hope you get some relief soon I strongly suggest you see a health care provider to evaluate these symptoms Sometimes things like leg pains in children dont need to be treated but youre an adult now and still have the pain That definitely deserves to be looked at The may or may not be related to the leg pain Anyone can develop migraines Many people believe they have migraines when they actually have common headaches Migraines are a very specific type of headache that requires special treatment Only a health care provider can tell you if you are getting true migraines or not Again I urge you to see a health care provider about this And I wish you all the best Whenever a person begins an exercise program its important they have been cleared by their primary health care provider to do so and also that they learn to perform exercises using correct form Incorrect form can cause serious injury The pain you experienced in your abdomen while doing an ab workout could be a result of something simple like a strained muscle or something more serious like a hernia If the pain doesnt clear up or if it gets worse or if you feel a bulge in your groin area or if you develop a fever over 101F you should seek medical attention On the other hand if the pain was momentary and you havent had any problems since the incident then you may be safe to take a waitandsee attitude about this Hope this helps You need to get this checked out by a medical professional as soon as possible The symptoms you describe could be due to an infection or a blood clot and both of these need to be treated quickly Either call your doctors office and explain to them whats going on so they can get you an appointment soon or go to an urgent care facility Im hoping the underlying cause of your symptoms is nothing serious but please dont delay getting this checked out All the best to you Im sorry to hear about your mastectomies Problems with the drainage tubes isnt uncommon after this procedure I hope by now youve called your surgeons office for further instructions Green or milky discharge in a drain tube can be a sign of infection and you want to get it checked out right away That said usually the surgeon wants to see you in his or her office rather than having you go to the emergency room However every surgeon is different Your best bet is to call the surgeons office immediately for instructions on what to do I wish you all the best with this First let me say Im sorry to hear you or someone you love is suffering from lung cancer Thats a difficult diagnosis to cope with Its not uncommon to suffer from back pain due to lung cancer Please talk to your cancer doctor about the medication options available to you to relieve this pain Narcotic medications ranging from pills to patches may be prescribed for severe pain related to cancer On your own you might try a heating pad set to low for about 20 minutes at a time Do not place the heating pad directly against the skin because you could get burned Instead place a towel between the heating pad and your skin If that doesnt work you also may try an icepack Again no more than 20 minutes at a time and never directly touching the skin Sometimes the combination of heat and ice helps relieve pain The best solution is to speak with your cancer doctor about how to deal with this If the back pain is a new symptom your health care provider may want to run further tests to determine whats causing it Best wishes to you Well I recommend you get this checked out Heart problems can hit like lightning heart attack or come on gradually It sounds like you may have a heart problem thats becoming gradually worse Of course this can only be determined with a physical examination and some other testing performed by your health care provider Chest pain that lasts 8 hours is nothing to ignore Please get medical attention as soon as you can All the best to you First thank you for being there when so many people needed you As everyone else ran away from the disaster you ran it  and that makes you special Second Im so sorry you had to go through all the horrors of that day and I hope you have received appropriate medical and psychological care in the years that have passed I always answer is it possible questions this way Anything is possible The better question is How likely is it In the case of kidney cancer not very likely The most common type of kidney cancer is called renal cell carcinoma and it accounts for only about 3 of all adult cancers diagnosed each year Thats pretty rare To survive 10 years with an undiagnosed case would be unheard of Many of the symptoms you describe would not be associated with kidney cancer I hope this knowledge serves to ease your mind as opposed to making you wonder what else could be causing these things There is so much we do not know regarding the health issues of first responders to the 911 incident Could your symptoms be caused by conditions at the WTC that day Maybe Could the symptoms be totally unrelated to 911 Maybe Your best bet is to seek continuing care from a single provider who can track your health across the lifespan Only through diligent followup and reporting can you hope to pinpoint the causes of the symptoms you describe Wishing you peace and wellness Unfortunately its no possible to diagnose this over the internet Although 28 years old sounds young for heart problems its not impossible If youre overweight sedentary smoke or have a family history of heart attack then youre at higher risk yourself If youre having any of these  you should seek emergency medical services by calling 911 Crushing pain squeezing sensation or fullness in the midchest that lasts for more than a few minutes or that comes and goes episodically Pain or discomfort that extends beyond your chest particularly pain or discomfort that radiates into the left jaw left arm or left back areas Shortness of breath Cold sweats nausea anxiety As you can see since anxiety can be a symptom of heart problems its impossible to distinguish the two via the web Only an EKG and some blood tests can say for sure if the troubles with your ticker or something else If you do not feel youre having an acute heart attack you may be OK to simply make an appointment with your health care provider at your earliest convenience I wish you all the best I would suggest you consult your OBGYN as soon as possible about this There may be nothing at all wrong but you do want someone to take a peek in there to make sure everything looks normal An appointment with your OBGYN also would be a good opportunity to discuss whether you should continue having  given this symptom Wishing you and your baby all the best Sounds plausible to me After all a number of nerves run up the back of the heel If you drive frequently and compress those nerves they could give you pain You might consider wearing a shoe with more cushioning to avoid this problem Some people favor driving moccasins Whatever helps to get the pressure off those nerves Hope you feel better Oh ouch Im sorry youve experienced a  Im not sure how long ago you finished your antibiotics but they do continue working for some time after you stop So if its only been a day or so Id wait and see what happens A pilonidal cyst can be painful even if its not infected Usually doctors do not prescribe antibiotics for these cysts Instead they need to be drained in order to heal The best advice is this If youre concerned about the cyst you should go back and see your doctor again Only he or she can examine the area to determine if the cyst has healed or if it needs further treatment Hope this helps Oh ouch So much for that whole working out is healthy thing right ha ha Well I think you need to get this checked out Id suggest making an appointment with your primary care provider You may merely have strained a muscle but then again you could have torn one And that would require medical attention Luckily the abdomen is protected with layer upon layer of muscle so its not too likely you suffered say a bowel herniation or something Nonetheless if you start running a fever or vomiting or develop any other unusual symptoms you might consider heading for an urgent care Otherwise youre probably fine to just check in with your primary care provider And of course dont do any weightlifting of any kind until youre cleared by your doc to do so Even leg work can strain your abs and you really need to rest them for now Best wishes Gosh its really hard to say what could be causing this without performing a physical examination Have you injured the shoulder Slept on it wrong Do you engage in contact sports Any of these things could cause the symptoms you describe It could be a pulled muscle muscle spasms shoulder injury nerve root compression at the spine  and thats just for starters Id suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider to have this checked out With a good physical exam and possibly some other testing your provider should be able to diagnose and treat the source of the symptoms Hope you feel better soon I would recommend you consult your doctor about this The US Food and Drug Administration FDA regulates surgical mesh as a medical device They track reports of complications from surgical mesh and pain is a known complication from hernia repair mesh Some types of mesh used in hernia repairs were recalled some years ago Your health care provider may be able to give you more information about that Mainly you want to have this looked at to make sure you havent had a recurrence of hernia which also is a known complication of hernia repair with or without mesh I wish you all the best Im sorry to hear youre going through this Sinus pain can feel so miserable is an inflammation swelling of the tissue that lines the This swelling of the tissue can cause the cavities to fill with fluid which causes pressure and pain and sometimes an infection Sinusitis can be caused by allergies nasal polyps a deviated septum or even smoke in the environment I hope your doctor has examined you to see if you have  While polyps arent extremely common in 14 year olds theyre not unheard of If you have not been examined for polyps you might ask your parents to get you an appointment with an earnosethroat doctor for an exam Meanwhile there are some things you can try at home to relieve your symptoms including Using a vaporizer warm mist in your bedroom be sure to clean it regularly because these devices can sometimes grow mold Inhaling steam such as from a pan of hot not boiling water Warm compresses wash rag soaked in very warm water laid across the eyesbridge of the nose Saline nose drops available over the counter If there is a smoker in your household this could be a cause of your symptoms If possible spend as much time as you can in a smokefree environment Because pets and other allergies can make sinusitis symptoms worse try to keep your bedroom petfree and make sure to vacuum or mop and dust regularly I hope one or more of these tips brings you some relief Im sorry to hear youre going through that Leg pain can be so uncomfortable Its hard to tell exactly whats going on without a physical examination but my best guess would be  This annoying condition can affect people who jog for exercise but they also can hit people who just once ran to catch a cab or something If the problem is shin splints the best advice is not to perform the activity that causes the pain So if this is occuring because youre walking fast for exercise try slowing down your pace If it just occurred randomly from a single activity like catching that cab then probably just resting the leg will allow for healing There are more tips at the link above Hope you feel better soon Im sorry to hear youre going through this and experiencing such anxiety Id suggest you make a phone call to get an appointment with a gynecologist as soon as possible to set your mind at ease Many conditions can cause the symptoms you describe from a vaginal yeast infection to a urinary tract infection to a sexually transmitted disease The only way to diagnose this properly is through a physical exam by a medical professional What youre describing does not sound like a medical emergency so please do not run to the emergency room Just get an appointment with your gynecologist or with a womens health center as soon as you can Best wishes to you Ouch Getting a tat is painful enough without then experiencing a hard lump underneath it Id suggest you see a health care provider about this Its possible the lump is scar tissue formation but its impossible to tell without a physical exam are a known complication of tattooing but these generally are smaller bumps in the skin If the tattoo ink is placed too deeply in the skin it can cause scar formation Your tattoo also may appear raised Again its impossible to know whats going on without having a health care provider perform an exam At the very least getting a professional opinion will help set your mind at ease Hope this helps Im glad to hear youre under the care of a physician who is watching this carefully Any joint replacement carries a risk of infection It sounds like your doctor has things under control In general an elevated SED rate indicates inflammation somewhere within the body An elevated SED rate alone would not be enough to say your prosthetic knee is infected Cloudy bloody drainage does not necessarily indicate infection Presumably your doctor will culture the drainage which can take several days or even weeks to see if any bacteria grow out If there are bacteria in the drainage the culture will identify the strain so your doctor can treat the infection I think instead of worrying or being concerned you should be proactive about monitoring your symptoms Get a thermometer and take your temperature every day at the same time not when you first wake up in the morning You can expect some variation but if you start running a fever over 101F then its time to call your doctor If you dont get a sameday call back call again before the office closes Also be alert for other symptoms of infection such as loss of appetite feeling weak and general malaise feeling like you are getting the flu for example If these symptoms develop call your doctor I hope your knee problem turns out to be something very simple Wishing you well Sorry to hear youre going through this Unfortunately diagnosing this problem requires a physical examination A number of things could be causing the symptoms you describe Anything from an injured ligament to a bone chip could be the culprit If this is an injury to a ligament for example rest is the main cure It can take awhile for that type of injury to get better I suggest you visit your primary care provider to get a diagnosis Your doctor can tell you what to do to treat this if anything Hope this helps I suppose its possible can be very painful and Im sure it might feel as if the pain is radiating down the neck to the shoulder However the pain youre describing could be caused by many other conditions including muscle strain  or even possibly  The only way to tell whats causing your pain is for you to get an examination by a medical professional If your pain doesnt clear up or if its accompanied by a fever Id suggest you contact your primary health care provider for an appointment to find out whats going on Hope this helps Im sorry to hear youre going through this The fear of having cancer must be very tough for you to cope with Im glad to hear you have a mammogram scheduled That is a good starting point and it sounds like your health care provider is on top of your situation While you wait try to remember that worrying will only cause you misery and can even have a negative impact on your immune system Look for support from family and friends Try to distract yourself Focus on the many positive things in your life no matter how small they may seem If you can try to get a massage or otherwise pamper yourself to relieve your excessive stress Even though you have a family history of cancer its not a sure bet you have cancer too Its entirely possible your breast lump is benign noncancerous and that your other symptoms can be attributed to a virus or even stress I know its hard but try to work on reducing your stress level and staying as healthy as possible as you work through the process of getting a diagnosis Take care of yourself Certainly this is something worth investigating Its impossible to tell what may be causing this without a physical examination but one possibility that comes to mind is  Id suggest you start by consulting your primary health care provider He or she can do a physical examination and possibly take an Xray to determine if you have arthritis in your neck vertebrae or possibly degenerative disc disease If you do your provider can discuss treatment options with you Hope this helps Youre a good grandpa to notice this and be concerned Id suggest the boys parents speak to their pediatrician about this Several conditions can cause a boy to have a sideways stream like that A couple of possible reasons that come to mind which Im including for informational purposes and as examples only include urethral polyps and meatal stenosis Both of these are treatable The boys pediatrician should be able to investigate this situation further and arrive at a diagnosis and appropriate treatment Again good for you for noticing this and calling attention to it I wish you and your grandson all the best Unfortunately theres no solid answer to your question Muscle pain and weakness such as the pain you describe is a known  Statin medications are used to  Im guessing your health care provider switched you from simvastatin to atorvastatin to see if it would help your upper arm pain The answer remains to be seen If your arm pain clears up then great If it doesnt then Id recommend you go back to your health care provider to discuss the situation There are many statin drugs to choose from Just because you experience a side effect from one of them does not mean youll experience side effects from all of them I hope this helps Good luck to you Sorry youre going through this misery First lets not jump to the conclusion this is  though it certainly sounds like it could be Id suggest you see a medical professional for an accurate diagnosis As you know if it is shingles you may be able to take a prescription medication to help with the pain If its not shingles your health care provider may be able to provide you with treatment for whatever it actually is Try to refrain from pulling your hair out as this can cause permanent loss of hair in those areas Also remember shingles in the blister stage is contagious and can cause someone whos never had to come down with the illness To help avoid this make sure youre washing your hands thoroughly and often Also do not share any combs brushes or other personal hygiene implements I hope you get a diagnosis quickly Yeah I think youve suffered enough and now its time to get this checked out As you speculated its possible you have a more severe injury than you originally thought If youd torn a ligament or something I think youd have known it at the time Youd probably have experienced debilitating pain And if you did tear a ligament there may not be much to do for it a year later Still its worth having it looked at Sometimes rest is the key Its possible you had a minor injury but keep aggravating it by lifting weights or pushingpulling too much Only a doctor or other medical professional can give you guidance on how to treat this Best wishes to you Unfortunately its not possible to say whats causing this without doing a physical exam and maybe some other testing It could be as simple as a muscle cramp Your best bet is to make an appointment with your primary healthcare provider to discuss the situation Please dont be embarrassed Medical professionals deal with cases like this all the time and their only concern is to make a diagnosis and get you appropriate treatment if required Hope this helps Good luck to you Good question I cant answer specifically because you didnt mention the name of the antibiotic youre taking However WebMDs website offers a search feature that allows you to look up drug names and view specific side effects In general its not uncommon for any antibiotic to cause abdominal pain Im not familiar with increased urination as a side effects of antibiotics but you have to bear in mind that everyones body responds differently to any given drug If youre concerned about these side effects I suggest you call your health care provider to report them I would not recommend stopping the antibiotics without being told to do so by your physician Take care Im sorry youre experiencing this The fact youre experiencing this in both nipples actually could be a good sign because breast cancer doesnt usually arise in both breasts or nipples at the same time So you can probably put your mind at ease about that aspect of things Although the sensation feels like a deep ache you might be suffering from dry nipples You can try keeping your nipples moisturized with a good hand lotion to see if that helps If you dont get relief from moisturizing Id suggest you consult your primary health care provider to rule out anything more serious Hope this helps Its always worrisome when a loved one is experiencing painful scary symptoms like your husbands In fact I always think its harder to cope with these things when its happening to my husband instead of me dont you So many conditions could cause the symptoms youre describing Thats why your husbands physician is having him undergo an  This test will help figure out whats going on so that you your husband and your physician can work together to put together a treatment plan Its also possible the endoscopy is just one of several tests your husbands health care provider will run before making a diagnosis It can be very hard to wait through all of this testing but hang in there Meanwhile remember to take care of your own health needs too As the caregiver youre under a tremendous amount of stress and you dont want to get sick Be sure to eat right drink plenty of fluids and maybe go for a walk when you can Try to get plenty of sleep Youll feel better and youll be in a strong position to see your husband through this health crisis Best wishes to you Sorry youre going through this While youre obviously young to have heart trouble thats always the first thing that comes to mind when someone complains of chest pain In fact if your chest pain begins to feel like a crushing or squeezing type discomfort that wont go away you definitely should go to the emergency room However I think the more likely culprit here is a condition called  This is an inflammation of the cartilage between the rib and the sternum breastbone near the top of the sternum Its quite common in young women Several things can cause it but its not usually serious You probably should have this checked out by a medical professional just to be on the safe side But unless youre having other  I wouldnt run off to the emergency room Just get in to see your primary care provider as soon as you can Feel better soon I would suggest you get this checked out by your primary care provider Lower back pain in at the time of a bowel movement can represent two unrelated issues for example maybe the back pain is caused by straining due to constipation but it can also be a sign of other conditions including prostate problems or endometriosis I dont know if youre a man or woman so Im covering both bases Also start taking a good look at your stools bowel movements and note what they look like In other words are they soft and brown Black Oily Loose Your health care provider will want this information to help diagnose the problem quicker I hope youre able to get this figured out soon since it sounds like its having a negative impact on your everyday life Im sorry to hear youre going through this Well it could be a rash Or it could be a circulation problem Only a physical examination by a health care provider can say for sure whats going on Id advise you to get this checked out sooner rather than later If its a rash your health care provider can recommend a treatment If its a sign of a larger problem your healthcare provider can get a jump on treating it which means a better outcome for you Theres simply no downside to getting a doctor to look at this Hope this helps Well my friend it sounds like you are  And on top of that probably have a  yes That would account for any visible red blood on the stool or in the toilet water after you have a bowel movement While I applaud your devotion to Greek yogurt I agree its probably wise to cut back from 812 containers per day Eating excessive amounts of dairy products can indeed cause constipation If you manage your constipation you can avoid further trouble from hemorrhoids First you need to make sure youre drinking plenty of water each day Second eat a fiberrich diet that includes a sizable portion of minimally cooked plant foods In the short term you can take an overthecounter stool softener NOT laxative such as docusate sodium Please do not do anything radical like a bowel cleanse Its not necessary and can disrupt the natural flora of your gut which are important for your immune system Just read up on constipation using the link above and you should find your problems resolving within a week or two Wishing you well Its difficult to say if these things are interrelated You might have constipationdiarrhea even if you didnt have anxietypanic attacks Lets take on the bowel problem first Whenever your bowels arent behaving themselves you should start with the basics Make sure you eat plenty of foods rich in fiber These can include fruits including dried fruit vegetables and whole grains Fiber helps move material through your intestines If you dont get enough fiber you can become constipated  Make sure youre drinking enough water Dehydration can lead to constipation Interestingly while too little fiber can cause constipation it also can lead to loose stools or diarrhea  If you have loose stools try increasing your fiber intake But stay away from fruits temporarily because eating fruit in large quantities can give you very loose stools Make sure youre exercising Exercise including walking can literally help get things moving in your bowels if youre constipated And exercise in general will help your body including your bowels function better If eating plenty of fiber drinking plenty of water and getting exercise dont solve your bowel issues then you should consult a medical professional Its possible you have irritable bowel syndrome or another condition that can or needs to be treated with medication Regarding the anxiety and panic attacks if youre not under the care of a psychologist for these conditions then I suggest you see someone Anxiety is very treatable today And since panic attacks often arise from unchecked anxiety treating your anxiety may make the panic attacks go away Wishing you well The short answer is you should not mix painkillers You should keep your health care provider informed of your physical status limitations and medication usage If you and your health care providers cant be partners then you should find another provider I realize things are never that simple Many things may limit your choice of providers from insurance coverage to the number of providers in your local area But seriously dont keep important information from your provider Its not in your best interest Try sitting down and having a good conversation with your provider Tell him or her you cant take dilaudid in the work environment and when you dont take the dilaudid your pain isnt controlled Ask to discuss options can you combine two different types of pain relievers can you get some other nonsurgical type of treatment can you get physical therapy At work find out if you can change anything about your work environment that is aggravating your condition can you take breaks more frequently on a schedule can you reduce your work hours temporarily can you get an ergonomic consultation to arrange your workstation in a way that doesnt irritate your neck As you can see there are many many ways you can approach this situation without selfmedicating I encourage you to explore better options with your provider Wishing you well Oh no Im so sorry to hear this And Yes yes you definitely could have a fractured rib You also could have a bad bruise or torn rib cartilage among other things The main thing is this If your injury is causing you to have trouble breathing you should probably be evaluated by a health care professional The accident youre describing is a perfect example of a situation where a person should go to an urgent care facility If an urgent care facility is not available at this time of day dont hesitate to go to the emergency room I hope you feel better soon Im sorry to hear youre suffering Chronic pain can be hard to deal with It sounds like youve had all the right tests to rule out the usual culprits of right upper quadrant pain gallbladder problems liver problems bladder infection kidney issues etc If none of those are causing the pain it will be classified as idiopathic which means doctors dont know whats causing it Many people suffer from pain of unknown origin as you do You dont say how long the pains been going on but there are many things that could cause such pain that are not detectable by any scan or blood test For example you could have somehow damaged cartilage between your lower ribs That can be very painful and can take a long time to heal Or you could have injured a muscle in that area Unfortunately medical science doesnt always have all the answers especially when it comes to pain The good news is all the scary possible causes have been ruled out such as cancer The other good news is idiopathic pain often goes away as quickly and mysteriously as it began The bad news is you may never know whats causing this pain I wish I could offer you a better answer but like I said medical science unfortunately doesnt always have an answer Wishing you all the best I have had gall bladder problems in the past I suffered from what seemed to be a muscle that pops out I went to the doctor and he suggested that I had gallstones I had an ultrasound done and none showed up I am on cholesterol medicine but I still get the pain once in a while No one seems to have an answer Your not alone in this world Your story is kind of similar to mine I had been bullied verbally Even after changing schools people would treat me the same They would whisper or talk behind my back look at me and make fun of me The pain is unbearable huh Not only the bullying at school started my anxiety disorder but it also came from my home nothing physical just verbally and emotionally I was hurt As soon as I started college I began to take therapy if figured I had nothing else to lose you know What else could happen to me Ive been feeling pain throughout my life Im use to it I couldnt trust anyone throughout my childhood However I felt tired suffocated and sad being alone and afraid so I decided to change No matter how much pain I felt I didnt want to feel depress any more and if I wanted to become free from my past and I guess my family I needed to built my strength Thanks to therapy I was able to deal with my anxiety and meet someone else could see understand me hear me out without judging my every word I was someone who was damaged but I was fixed little by little Although to be honest it still kinda of hurts thinking about those days I had a bump on my gums on top of my front toothI went to the dentist and I had an abscessed tooth  tooth infection The dentist pricked it and yellow gunk came out and it smelled bad After that I had a root canalMine didnt hurt and the bump was really soft It may be a cyst I say go to dentist for xrays You should get tea tree oil mouthwash just to keep your mouth clean until you see a dentist If youre overweight it could be too much weight put on your knee It happens to me all the time Otherwise I have no idea Ask your doctor You need to go to the hospitalthe infection couldve spread to your blood system and you could die This almost happened to me Go to a free clinic or something Maybe youre pregnant Or maybe its a side effect from your bc Consider talking to you doctor about a Uterine Hydrothermal Ablasion I had it done 6 years ago when I was 39 and it has helped me

an individual uses a tolerance develops requiring more of the drug to achieve the desired euphoric feeling Longterm abuse has the potential to lead to dependency and addictive behavior Depending on the severity of OxyContin abuse most people experience withdrawal symptoms when they stop taking the drug Withdrawal symptoms may include flulike symptoms constipation insomnia body aches and anxiety Symptoms may range in intensity from mild to painful While some people may try to quit OxyContin abuse cold turkey and try to suffer through withdrawal symptoms it is important to understand that most people who try to quit on their own usually return to their drug use just to find relief from the withdrawal symptoms The most common signs of OxyContin withdrawal include \tConstipationdiarrhea \tNauseavomiting \tFlu like symptoms \tExcessive sweating \tTremors \tSeizures While it is possible to overlook or dismiss some of these symptoms it is important to know that if left untreated all of these symptoms as minor as they may seem can lead to potentially lifethreatening conditions Most doctors recommend a medical detox treatment that will manage withdrawal symptoms and keep the patient comfortable throughout the process Medical detox treatment is available in an outpatient program through an inpatient detox treatment Inpatient medical detox treatments vary some use oral medications which take a bit longer to become active and others offer IV therapy medical detox which allows the medications to be immediately active The difference is that if you have to wait for relief from withdrawal symptoms you may be tempted to walk out of the detox before it is complete Gallus Detox Center is an inpatient private medical detox facility that specializes in IV therapy medical detox If you have questions about our facility or detox method please call us at 8553386929 In 1947 Methadone was introduced as a medication capable of treating pain but also as an effective component in addiction treatment Although Methadone is an opiate similar to Vicodin OxyContin and Morphine it is different in that when it is used it competes with and blocks other opiates at the opioid receptors in the brain and central nervous system Methadone prevents those drugs from becoming effective In addiction treatment Methadone works by tricking the brain and preventing withdrawal symptoms when other opiate use is discontinued Another component is that Methadone will stay active in the body for nearly 60 hours As with other opiate use chronic use of Methadone can lead to tolerance dependency and addiction Increasing the dose due to tolerance puts the individual at risk for overdose Gallus Detox Center is a private inpatient detox facility that specializes in IV therapy medical detox If you have questions about our facility or detox method please call us at 8553386929 Suboxone is a combination BuprenorphineNaloxone Buprenorphine will activate opioid receptors in the brain and prevent opiate withdrawal Buprenorphine is a partial agonist meaning that it has a limit to how much it can activate the opioid receptors It can prevent withdrawal but not create the euphoria Naloxone is an opiate antagonist and prevents the drug from being abused  meaning that if the Suboxone is crushed and injected the individual will go into full and immediate withdrawal When Suboxone is taken as directed the Naloxone is not noticeable and the Buprenorphine offers relief from withdrawal However when Suboxone is abused the Naloxone is fully activated and the individual will go into immediate withdrawal that cannot be reversed by taking other opiate drugs Taking Suboxone and Methadone is dangerous and may send you into full withdrawal You should talk with your doctor regarding your concerns regarding pain management trying to selfmedicate can lead to dangerous sideeffects and be fatal No Ive never had that problem Ive had mine removed just over 2 years ago and still have problems with mostly eating certain foods Nothing to heavy and definitely no oils Laying on my side opposite of where the gallbladder was still makes an uncomfortable feeling as well No tight clothes

from ulcer to diverticulitis but the pain is stillt there and I still dont know the cause Good Luck I used to get mine before my period only lasted a few days Use plenty of hand creme but a good one may help no gout gout NO Under no circumstances should you take suboxone and methadone together you will end up in You need to see your pain management professional and explain that you are on

swelling With a more severe sprain you will not be able to walk Most importantly it is important to treat the ankle well while healing This means full rest elevation of the ankle ice and medicine to reduce the swelling Stay off of that foot either resting or with crutches for at least 710 days If you did not do that it is possible that the ankle ligament is not properly healed In your case its

neck pain and reduce \t\t inflammation of the soft tissues Pain relief will \t\t allow you to move your neck gently so you can begin easy exercises and start \t\t the healing process Although pain

that are rubbed into the \t\t\t neck Acetaminophen  such as Tylenol  which reduces \t\t\t pain Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs  including \t\t\t aspirin such as Bayer ibuprofen such as Advil or naproxen sodium such as \t\t\t Aleve  that can help relieve pain and reduce inflammation Do not give aspirin to anyone younger than 20 because of the risk of \t\t\t Reye syndrome  Prescription pain

associated with parenteral cyanocobalamin or vitamin B12 given by injection have included dyspepsia nausea vomiting and mild transient diarrhea These side effects are very mild or not present at all with oral vitamin B12 If you are experiencing severe gas pains that have not subsided within a few hours you should consult your healthcare provider Expiration dates on products whether it is medication or food are printed on the package for a reason It is to protect you from damaging your body making you ill and to let you know that the product will no longer be effective We wouldnt drink milk that is 2 weeks past its expiration so why would you want to take Advil 2 weeks past the expiration Advil is used to treat pain fever and inflammation You would not want to extend your symptoms due to taking an expired ineffective product Nor would you want to guess at how many tablets you have to take to get an effective dose increasing the possibility of toxicity and side effects This is not a gray situation It is black and white Either the medication is safe to take or not If the medication has expired please do not ingest it Instead work with your pharmacy or local police department on how to dispose of expired medication I would be careful taking Maxalt daily on a regular basis This medication is not designed or recommended for daily use It is to be taken within the first hour of migraine symptoms It doesnt prevent the onset but rather helps to relieve symptoms from the migraine I would seek a second medical opinion about using Maxalt daily If you are experiencing pain or need to take an overthecounter pain medication I would recommend that you avoid any NSAIDs nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen naproxen Advil or Aleve This class of medications is harsh on the stomach and can increase GI bleeding without you being aware of it I would stick with acetaminophen Tylenol to aid in pain relief Also consult with your local pharmacist for product selection and with your health care professional about the symptoms you are experiencing and the treatments you have used for the pain Just like many antibiotics clarithromycin can cause upset stomach nausea vomiting and diarrhea However there isnt any contraindication regarding a history of ulcers when taking this medication If you are taking any ulcer medications it would be important to check with your pharmacist to make sure there arent any drug interactions that would decrease the effectiveness of your ulcer medication which would cause flareups The medication can be taken with or without food If the upset stomach is present try taking it with food to see if it subsides If at any point it worsens you should consult your healthcare provider to see if another medication is better for you Every antibiotic has different absorption characteristics Some antibiotics work better with or without food Some are better with a fatty substance such as milk However some may have a drug interaction with the calcium contained in dairy products In this case milk should not be drunk with the medication and the consumption of the two should be separated out by about two hours The best liquid to take medication with is water It is important to check with your local pharmacist at the time of picking up the antibiotic or any medication to see if there are any food restrictions with your prescriptions It is important to differentiate between sore muscles from the workout and a possible injury You typically feel sore muscles about a day later and the feeling can last for 2 to 3 days You can treat it with rest and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medicines such as aspirin ibuprofen or naproxen If there is pain associated with the sciatica you should consult your physician to make sure there isnt a more intense injury that needs to be treated To eradicate intestinal worms you need a prescription medication based on the type of worm or parasite This really needs to be checked out by a physician There are specific lab tests that need to be done to make sure she is infected There is not a product found overthecounter that will treat worms or parasites So be sure to work closely with her health care provider  The liver is responsible for metabolizing Vicoden and alcohol The liver can metabolize only a certain amount of alcohol per hour regardless of the amount that has been consumed The rate of alcohol metabolism depends in part on the amount of metabolizing enzymes in the liver which varies among individuals and appears to have genetic determinants In general after the consumption of one standard drink the amount of alcohol in a drinkers blood blood alcohol concentration or BAC peaks within 30 to 45 minutes A standard drink is defined as 12 oz of beer 5 oz of wine or 15 oz of 80proof distilled spirits all of which contain the same amount of alcohol Alcohol is metabolized more slowly than it is absorbed Since the metabolism of alcohol is slow consumption needs to be controlled to prevent accumulation in the body and intoxication Everyones metabolism by the liver can vary depending on several different factors including age food consumption body weight gender and most importantly and most controllably drugdrug interactions Alcohol has a drugdrug interaction with acetaminophen Tylenol Many studies have shown that liver damage can occur with the combination of acetaminophen and alcohol No The machine will not denature any of your medications or interfere with their stability There is no stronger overthecounter medication for headache or migraine pain relief Headaches are very individualized There are several overthecounter medications you can use to alleviate painful headaches These medications include acetaminophen Tylenol an effective overthecounter analgesic pain reliever and antipyretic fever reducer medication This medication can help with achy pain stiffness and fever However it does not have any antiinflammatory properties This is important for some types of headache relief In addition the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug class NSAIDs consists of products like ibuprofen Motrin Advil and naproxen Naprosyn Aleve which work by exhibiting analgesic relief antipyretic and antiinflammatory properties Lastly combination products such as Excedrin Migraine contain acetaminophen aspirin and caffeine These ingredients combined make a more powerful headachepain reliever than the ingredients separated out alone It is important to follow the instructions on the label of over the counter medication and not to mix products in order to prevent overdosing or toxicity Monitor the frequency and intensity of your migraines to know when it is time to seek professional help and possibly the addition of a prescription medication Both Vicodin and clindamycin have side effects like upset stomach nausea and vomiting but not heartburn These medications currently do not have any known drug interactions with Zantac 150 ranitidine or Tums He should be fine taking all these products together However watch his symptoms If symptoms worsen you may want to seek medical advice to make sure he doesnt have another condition Diclofenac and nabutone are both nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs NSAIDs Diclofenac and nabutone are both used to relieve pain tenderness swelling and stiffness caused by osteoarthritis arthritis caused by a breakdown of the lining of the joints and rheumatoid arthritis arthritis caused by swelling of the lining of the joints In addition diclofenac is used to aid with ankylosing spondylitis arthritis that mainly affects the spine These medications are very similar However you should consult your physician or health care provider before using another medication that wasnt originally prescribed for the sprained ligament Before you substitute nabutone for the diclofenac make sure the prescriber is fine with the switch There arent any drug interactions with taking Percocet oxycodone and acetaminophen and Ambien zolpidem together However oxycodone and zolpidem both work on the central nervous system and have an additive side effect of drowsiness and impairment of activities One should be very cautious of taking both medications together The additive products alone can be dangerous Due to the side effects the drowsiness and impairment can be covering up the symptoms and not aiding in treatment of the condition Work with your healthcare provider if both these medications are required on a regular basis No matter the frequency informing your providerpharmacist about the selfuse of any medications is important in order to safely treat your conditions and to find the root cause of symptoms Yes some can depending on how the pain is and how much you can handle Have you got your eyes checked lately That can cause headaches You should get that checked out asap Dont sound good I would say yes My dad had a cyst on his bicep and had it cut

Thursday there was hardly any pain but around 9 pm there was so much pressure on my jaw that I walked into my house with tears rolling down my face I tried a warm bath submerging my face and ears in the water because my ears felt like they were bleeding and being jabbed with needles as they did when I went to the nurse the first time I tried to gargle salt water drink hot drinks cold drinks ice heat pads alternating Tylenol and ibuprofen nothing was helping Friday morning I woke my mom up still crying because of the terrible pain and she took me to a Family Clinic I couldnt open my mouth enough for them to look inside but they did look in my ear and said it was fine that it was pain from my throat They gave me a shot of penicillin and 12 Tylenol 3 Ive been taking the Tylenol 3 every 5 hours as prescribed and the pain never lets up I dont think the penicillin hasnt kicked in and it has been over 24 hours My jaw is still causing me a lot of pain and I still cannot open my mouth

those things are a good thing   All I can say is if ice and heat and pills dont work and you are worried maybe go to a doctor Or see a physiotherapist You might have something up in your spine Or maybe tell your dance teacher Sometimes they have seen enough injuries to tell you if it is normal or not Shin splints is my guess Tell the coach for tips and go to the doctor If they get too bad he might need to stop running for a bit He ll more then likely have to do a bunch or tests and might need to go to physio or an orthopedic doctor for insoles Depends on what it really is Did the pain start suddenly Did you lift something up and the pain started It could be sciatica Need to go see a Doctor Well you could have pulled a muscle Try ice and Ibuprofen Im no doctor but I would venture to say that you were probably just late coming on to your period Sometimes your periods can be heavier Im ignorant as to why this is exactly However sometimes mine tend to be way heavier one month and than normal the next Hello I have four kids One of them is two she is a spitfire She often cries for little to no reasoning behind it Its because she is developing she realizing that her actions get reactions She isnt doing it to get on your nerves or drive you insane  although can I say from one mother to another sometimes it feels that way However I do want to suggest that your little one may have food allergies This can cause a great deal of unhappiness and not wanting to eat I knew someone who had them and it took years for there parents to figure out that was why he was always crying and fussy I would say take her in for a check up and explain that you want her tested for food allergies If she is allergic and you get it under control it will change your life Hello there I would suggest taking a pregnancy test I know that you can have a light pink display if you are pregnant and dizziness However it could be that you are just late Im very regular too However things can effect your period such as stress or if you live with another female or have a close friend your cycles will shift closer to theirs mostly by a week Are you trying to get pregnant Just curious Let us know how it turns out From my understanding this is not abnormal Women experience these types of symptoms after menstration in many cases It depends on how long it is after but it sounds like its right after you stop bleeding This is common but should be discussed with your OB or primary to make sure they understand  Its possible that the penis pain youre experiencing may not be related to the back surgery sometimes things happen coincidentally However since you did first notice it postsurgery bring this up with your doctor and see if there is anything that might account for this You may also want to check with your urologist and explain what is going on On a different note for general penis health use a quality penis nutrient formula health professionals recommend Man1 Man Oil with a range of vitamins including A B5 and E Sounds like checking to see how far back your drug use if any is But I thought that was with hair follicles they can go back for a certain time I am not sure if they now have a blood test to do that which they probably do That sound like signs of a heart attack I would def go to the hospital and get checked better to be safe good luck Sounds like maybe you are if you havent starting your period and if you already have it sometimes in approx 2 weeks after your period stops you get a cramp like feeling from your ovaries doing there job could be over feeding him which is so easy to do Or something he is eating or drinking is not agreeing with him You might want to have his upper gi checked My granddaughter had those problems and had acid re flux sounds like sinus problems to metime to see a dr I worked at hospital as a Patient Advocate for 13yrs and spent a lot of time in the ERs witnessing the Ortho surgeons frustration from their patients delay in getting xrays and proper treatment all because of that old adage If you can move it it isnt broken That is only partially true Could be Fibromyalgia There are medications for this I have it myself and know the pain very well Please see your Dr soon As you know Adderall is a stimulant which in some individuals may cause palpitations or extra heart beats But in the majority of people who take it it improves quality of life  thats why your doctor prescribed it Mitral valve prolpapse with minimal valve regurgitation is not a diagnosis that would generally have me recommend against Adderall But its always a good idea to discuss your own situation with your doctor too Symptoms like chest pain that come on during walking or other exertion can be a sign of heart disease I recommend that you call your doctor now Even if you do not have risk factors like diabetes or high blood pressure you could still have heart disease or another condition causing your symptoms The most common thing to feel would be the end of your cervix It is at the back of the vaginal canal and feels firm like the end of ones nose Often there are Nabothian cysts on the face of the cervix which can make it feel irregular or bumpy Nabothian cysts are clogged mucus secreting ductskind of like getting a clogged pore on your face Less commonly you might be feeling a vaginal inclusion cyst Yet these tend to be softer than the cervix Your best bet is to see your GYN and have them do both a palpation with fingers and a speculum exam to try and see if there is any type of cyst present Yes some women have significant cramping while taking Provera to start a menstrual period While we tell women their flow will begin around 72 hours after the last Provera pill is taken bleeding can also begin before the pills are completed Usually it is suggested that all the pills be taken because the lining of the uterus may need all the synthetic progesterone to fully convert to a healthy status secretory effect In your specific case if you are having very severe cramping it is a reasonable option to check with the GYN prescribing the Provera They may suggest something for the discomfort If your bleeding does start before the medication is done confirm that you should finish up all the Provera pills  Ask him to take Nexium  httpwwwchoicechemistcomnexium if the problem continues However this should be done only on a doctors advise You could be experiencing bone spurs in your neck It is very painful can come and go and the severity can vary Turning your head a certain way can cause a flare up You should start with a simple xray then if that doesnt show the answer then proceed with an MRI If you feel it is infected you really should see a physician An infection should always be treated with antibiotics and never left untreated in hopes that it will go away on its own Seek the advise of a licensed MD for a correct diagnosis and to make sure you dont risk your health and become worse You should definitely ask your doctor about this Pain around the area could be for a number of reasons and may be minor but it is always best to consult with your physician to be sure You should see your physician and he or she should order an MRI You may have a herniated disk which is extremely painful This will not show up on an xray and can only be detected when you have an MRI A lot of things can contribute to this You didnt specify your age and if you could possibly be experiencing menopause If not are you on a new birth control pill or any type of birth control Many of these can cause irregular prolonged periods You also didnt mention if you experience pain with this If you have pain with it you should consult your physician You certainly need to take all this into consideration age type of birth control and if you have changed or switched any type of medication or are taking any type of new medication It sounds like you have a condition which causes you to not properly digest your food it doesnt even sound as if your food is going to your digestive system at all instead you are swallowing it and before it reaches your digestive tract you are having a reaction to it Talk to your physician and see if he can prescribe something you could have something simple called acid reflux where your food is trying to come right back up before even reaching your digestive tract Regardless of what is causing it you need to consult your doctor and let him run some tests Meanwhile you need to stick to a bland diet soft foods and eat slowly and chew your food very thoroughly Before rising to a standing position try stretching your leg out a few times before standing on it You may be sitting a bit longer than you think if you are busy and lose track of time and the stiffness is due to sitting in one position with lack of motion The entire time you are sitting do leg stretching by simply moving your legs out straight while you are sitting at a desk or in a chair If this worsens and you find you cant walk at all for several minutes after sitting for short periods of time you should consult your physician pain in the lower abdomen after a bowel movement if not severe is quite common You could be straining with bowel movements and if so you need to add a stool softener to your daily regimen Do not take laxatives Just take a mild stool softener and see if it helps If you have regular bowel movements and are not straining in any way to empty your bowels you should see your physican and if the pain is severe you should see him with out waiting I would first try the stool softener and eat a diet high in fiber first if the pain is mild and you only experience it after a bowel movement As long as it is prescribed by your MD and it is the same MD that is giving you both prescriptions Do not take this unless they are both prescribed by the same doctor and make sure he is aware of all other medicine you take It is probably caused by the birth control pill Make sure she is taking the lowest dose she can to prevent pregnancy The best thing for her to do is make sure she is on the lowest dose she can be She needs to not smoke if she does while taking birth control pills Bleeding spotting nausea symptoms of pregnancy are common with birth control pills Go immediately to your physician and make sure you dont have a tubal pregnancy this is a very serious condition The fetus is growing outside the fallopian wall rather than growing inside the abdomen This is an extremely painful condition and will only get worse without proper treatment and is very dangergous for you Gout almost always starts with pain in one of your big toes Gout is a build up of too much uric acid in the body and the pain is first felt in one of the big toes or both The symptoms you are describing sound more like a condition called neuropothy a painful condition caused by over active nerve endings Ask your doctor if it could be that it doesnt sound at all like gout to me It is possible It sounds as if you and your Mom are very close and you are very much in tune to her pain and therefore when she has her period you are having symptoms and pain similiar to hers Its the same as a husband that loves his wife so very much and often when she is pregnant he will have sympathy pain and experience some of what she is going through Does certain foods seem to make the pain worse or is it everything you eat Regardless you have some sort of intestinal problem and need to see your dr It sounds as if you are not digesing your food as you should and then after the 30minutes have passed it is being digested Are your stools normal and regular bowel movements Again this is really a question for your MD but I would try eating bland foods eating slowly and rather than one large meal eat smaller meals several times a day eating slowly Theres a good possibility that your posture is causing your back pain What I would suggest to you is decompressing the back You can do this with back pain exercises I would suggest visiting httpwwwdoctorspainreliefsystemscom Theres a few videos that will show you how to properly perform these back pain exercises Sitting for long periods of a time can result in the back pain If you can get up and stretch a little during the prolong hours of sitting its going to help you relieve your pain a little Youre always welcome to read more Hope this helps Some of the adjustments your orthodontist may make to your braces may make your mouth feel sore or uncomfortable When needed overthecounter pain relievers like Motrin or Tylenol can help relieve the pain If you always experience a lot of pain after your braces are adjusted talk to your orthodontist about it he or she may be able to make the adjustments a bit differently Most people who have received dental implants say that there is very little discomfort involved in the procedure Local anesthesia can be used during the procedure and most patients report that implants involve less pain than a tooth extraction After the dental implant mild soreness can be treated with overthecounter pain medications such as Tylenol or Motrin To ease teething pain massage your childs gums with a clean finger or the back of a small cold spoon Allow your child to bite down on a chilled but never frozen teething ring A frozen teething ring can damage the gums Try an overthecounter teething ointment to numb the gums Ask your dentist or doctor for some product recommendations Allow your child to suck on a cold wet cloth Teething biscuits or cookies and frozen bananas are not recommended These objects promote tooth decay and may cause your child to choke She needs to go see a doctor preferably a gynecologist immediately A nonstop period could be a sign of polycystic ovarian syndrome PCOS Usually PCOS causes women not to have periods or to have very intermittent ones but in my case it caused my period to go on for months without fully stopping So like I said tell her she needs to go to the gynecologist If she chooses to go to the regular doctor theyll probably send her to the gyn anyway Hope it stops soon It could be a hairline fracture or your kneecap may have been briefly dislocated without you knowing it like when youre sleeping I have dislocated my knees before and they hurt like that when either A theyre about to dislocate again soon or B they must have popped out for a second in the middle of the night Im assuming I think its best to just go easy on your knees Definitely dont kneel whether its a nerve fracture or dislocation kneeling will not help Just move your leg carefully dont jerk it suddenly to the side which could make it dislocate again if thats whats wrong in the first place If the pain persists for another week you should probably go to the doctor or a chiropractor  You have a cold in your bowels Do you feel run down and dont feel like doing anything That is the way I feel when I get a cold in my bowels and it is green It could be either or Between my sister and I we had fell down a flight of steps I badly bruised my tailbone but she had broke hers So my advice to you go get it checked out for your benefit youll be glad you did My sister had to sit on a cushion called a donut Ive had sinus problems most of my adult life and I feel for you First of all if youre blowing out clear junk rather than yellow or green mucus you probably dont have a sinus infection  at least not yet You need to contact a Gynecologist not a regular primary care dr Have the gynocologist do an internal exam to make sure the pain is from your uterus that would be my guess But you need to be seen by a specialist you may need surgery I have the same problem Ive found that getting an orthotic for your shoes will help with the foot pain and before my shift starts I usually take a couple of either Aleve or some other type of pain relief That tends to keep the pain level down  Im not as stiff when Im done with my shift When I have my pains it is in the middle of my back It doesnt start on the right or left It starts where my spine is and moves around to the front to where it hurts to breathe and move The only thing that helps me are two bags of ice for my back and just under my ribcage and either 2 alieves or 2 midols I had to checked out and was hooked up to a machine and everything They said it was my breathing but I cant remember if that was exactly the case I lost 41 pounds but I could still feel the start of it but I would take medicine before it could go any further Sounds almost the same as what happened to me I found out that it was an abscess You should seek medical attention because it could spread and cause a severe infection Hi there first you should know that heart attack depends on the pain condition of the pain If the pain is dull then you could just get a drink of water If the pain is stabbing then you must go to a hospital Extreme chest pains can lead to heart attack and even death You must make sure that you get help from a doctor And he or she should give you chest pain medications Hi The pain that you have comes from aging but it is wired that you cant stand up straight but anyway the first thing that you should do is get a medical checkup from your doctor and let himher do an xray on you to see what is going on with your back And heshe should give you a medication for back pain You can try the Tylenol EXTRA strength That is really good for migraine headaches and back pain So go see your doctor and tell himher that you want to do an xray scan Everybody is right and you can also take the Tylenol extra strength I dont want to question anything but did you know that sitting too much can lead to physical inactivity and obesity and death So check in with a doctor and heshe should give you a medication for back pain or if not then you can get Tylenol extra strength Nope you will not be able to play if you just leave the pain You must see your doctor and tell himher what you have The doctor should give you something for your foot Hi there Happy to help First you should know what is one of the causes of liver cancer and that would be tobacco smoking andor genetic mutations from your DNA That means your DNA gets damaged and your body cant fix it But to get the professional help that you need its a good idea to check in with a doctor and tell himher your symptoms of liver cancer and the other symptoms that i am looking at for this question But if you are 78 years old then chances are that muscle mass will drop That is what happens when you hit the late ages If you have right side pain most likely you might have appendicitis So you must go to a hospital so they can remove that infected appendix Nausea is caused by appendicitis And feet swelling is mostly caused by late age so dont always panic if you get pain Hey there The reason that you have inability to pass gas is because of the colon The best thing to do is pat your stomach for a minute If that does not work then you should drink tea called anise tea And you should get enough fiber Inability of passing gas can cause serious health problems like appendicitis the infection of the appendix The reason you have pain from working out is because you have a lot of air caught in the air vent It is best to see a doctor if you have inability to pass gas and he or she will give you some kind of medication Sorry to hear that but here is some advice First you must make sure that you get to a doctor right away Chest pain like what you have are very dangerous because some chest pains can cause serious problems like heart attack and in severe cases it can lead to death But to prevent it you have to make sure that you see your doctor and tell him or her that that you have chest pain and shoulder pains Most likely your doctor should give you a medication for pain But getting medication on your own is not a good idea Some of these drugs dont really help pain You dont have appendicitis because appendicitis is not a come and go pain Appendicitis is EXTREMELY painful The thing you have is actually caused by extra fluid form your system being trapped in your air vent But if you are trying to become pregnant do not put too much pressure on yourself That is probably why you have abdomen pain And you can also take women pills for pregnancy That wont really make you pregnant but it will prepare your body for pregnancy You should check in with a doctor and tell him or her that you have abdomen pain and you think it is from your ovaries I also had problems to see my veins They turned me on my stomach and did the Doppler tests and found this is the only way to see the deep veins which carry 80 of the blood back up and found I have a hereditary absence of large deep veins My deep veins are the same size as the peripheral veins causing swelling and painful red spots that now limit my standing or sitting drastically Wearing compression stockings are the only relief they can prescribe She may have this abnormally strange vein size as well Im looking for answers myself Good luck I also had problems to see my veins They turned me on my stomach and did the Doppler tests and found this is the only way to see the deep veins which carry 80 of the blood back up and found I have a hereditary absence of large deep veins My deep veins are the same size as the peripheral veins causing swelling and painful red spots that now limit my standing or sitting drastically Wearing compression stockings are the only relief they can prescribe She may have this abnormally strange vein size as well Im looking for answers myself Good luck You should always use waterbased lubricants and NOT oilbased Darkening of your stool could be an indication of internal bleeding Those arent relevant symptoms and 11 days is too soon for a diagnosis of that condition Possibly a mouth ulcer Ive had an outbreak myself and know what youre going through Your husband is probably suffering from postherpethic neuralgia as a result of the herpes zosters virus I am a massage therapist not a doctor but my advice would be to exercise the joint carefully Once a ligament has been stretched out from a severe sprain or dislocation it will always be a little bit loose and the joint will be less stable than it was before which means the joint is more prone to sprains than it was Careful exercise can help strengthen the ligaments and tighten them up some I would suggest finding a walking trail near your home that is a dirt path or even a rubber track at nearby park or school There will be less impact on your joints from the exercise if you avoid concrete or asphalt Walk as far as you are comfortable if youre feeling a lot of popping and grinding when you walk start slow and try to increase the distance you are walking over time This just happens to me at night It is great that you have had exellent results from your surgical procedures You are wise to try to get moving and active again Being fit and active is the best thing that you can do to prevent future problems with your back However it is important that you develop a progressive aerobic and strengthening regimen I would suggest that you contact your surgeon for a referral to a spine physical therapist who can help you get started on your return to exercise In general you want to avoid impact type exercises so the elliptical is a reasonable option You should also avoid any heavy weights particularly free weights above your head that will cause compression to the spine I usually recommend that spine patients use the weight machines that use resistence mechanisms or weights on tracks with pulleys These are less likey to injury you You also need to do regular core muscle strengthening Again a physical therapist can help you get started Pilates is the commercial exercise course that is most similar to a core strengthening program Unfortunately this is a very common scenario MRIs are very sensitive and not specific This means that they often find all kinds of things that may or may not be related to the pain So if the study was truly normal the chances that it missed something that is serious or a clear cut cause of your pain is very unikely If you have not already had a consult with a spine specialist having one now to review your case and your MRI may be reasonable However do not be surprised if he or she is unable to give you a clear cause of your pain Only about 10 of the time can we look at any type of xray or MRI and say with certainty that something is the cause of back pain Even in 2010 we do not have a test where a flashing red light goes off at the site of the pain As such many times the focus has to shift from finding the source of the pain to coming to grips with the pain If you have had pain for a year the statistics unfortunately suggest that you will continue to have pain for sometime maybe indefinitely The goal may have to become to minimize your pain and to maximize your function I can try to reassure you by saying that the pain is not like the pain of a hot stove on your hand The pain is not burning or damaging your back to it is okay to try and be as active as you can even if it causes some pain Sorry to paint such a grim picture but I believe in being honest and to the point Having realistic expectations can help you move forward I hope things do improve even if the pain does not go away completely I wonder now after researching I could be an allergy but I am not sure as I never have had any allergies I am wondering could be something more as I only have one good eye and when the blurring happens I can not see It was probably something you ate had irritated it Try ice and compression Yes my best guess would be ovulation it can be very painful at times it could be the left tonsilLook at it with a flashlight by looking at the throat If you see anything white white dots they need to see a doctor That is usually a sign of Strep Throat which can be extremely dangerous if not treated right away with antibiotics If the tonsil looks healthy then it could also be a lymph node Thanks It ended up going away on its own I think it was from my wisdom teeth trying to come in They still havent come in They come out and then go back in and then out again What was the CT of her whole body or just the leg Does the numbness occur when she is sitting with her legs crossed laying down on that side or spontaneously Is it long lasting or short lasting I say dont lose hope I know people who have been diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and have actually gone into remission after it was spread through their whole body I am a firm believer that emotional health has a ton to do with physical health so keep her in good spirits I recommend going to the doctor Vomiting too often can damage your esophagus and it takes the nutrients from your body It could be a hormone thing a stomach issue a stomach ulcer Best to get it checked by a doctor Have you mentioned this to your doctor You should mention it to them Yes the cysts can and usually do burst It has happened to me twice It caused me to have severe pain on my one side and nausea I ended up going to the ER and found that it was my cyst that burst Are they just starting to come in When teeth are coming in they can cause ear pain and its possible to even get an ear infection I suffered from the same problem as a child do you have regular periods Are they longer than 32 days apart If they are then it could be uterine lining building up I recommend seeing a gyno When were you told that you have a UTI and did you take antibiotics for it If not you should see a doctor asap for treatment as UTIs can spread to kidneys if left alone My husband underwent two hernia surgeries a few years apart He experienced different levels of pain post surgery each time Some of the pain did extend beyond 6 weeks Most surgeons will suggest your pain will last 6 weeks and expect your body to follow protocol However each person is unique and so is their healing process as well as pain tolerance In the case of hernia surgery specifically if you had mesh inserted you may experience both healing pain as well as pain andor discomfort from your body assimilating the mesh I am not a medical professional but my opinion is that if your pain is accompanied by fever you need to call your physician Also only you can determine if the level of pain you are experiencing is intolerable in which case again I would recommend a call to your doctor Dont know if you go to the tanning bed but I went through that It was caused from an ingredient in the tanning lotion It didnt hurt or itch but benedryl done the trick OMGgoogle this I just had this happen to my girlfrind and we spent 2 days in the hospital and the diagnosis was abdomanal miagrainsreally google itI thought the Dr was crazy I kinda figured that it might be MS for the last few

i cant sleep at all cause of the i tied explaining my problems but they said what i told them was signs of a stroke wanted to get looked over case if it was MS but instead they ingnored that and said i wasnt hydrated enough cause they couldnt gett enough blood for testing since then i been drinking more water but my problems hasnt went away feels like there getting a bit worse each month i went to

suffering from depression and that one where you worrie alot and this blank stare he figured to perscribe me sleeping pill to solve my problems but first time i took them i started expercing the side effects of them mainly blurred vision since my grandparents only sees a few and not It sounds like Mono or Epstien Bar Virus They can cause each other thogh because I had both in Summer 2012 and I still got the swollen lympnodes If you get these from Mono they can last up to a yearnot suppose to but I do and to tell you the truth I think I am getting it again but a whole lot worse Mono can lead to Lymphoma same symptoms as Mono and I know that because my ex did and well I know I got Lymphoma or Mono again but anyways if you got Mono there is no treatment for it the only thing you can do is get a lot of rest and take some over the counter pain pills and you cannot do hardly any physical activity because when you have Mono your spleen gets swollen and if you fall you could rupture your spleen and the result for that is Hospital for a while Mononucleosis Symptoms Pain or discomfort Enlarged or swollen glands Fever Excessive sweating Night sweats Skin rash Sore throat Yellow skin Yellow eyes Decreased appetite Fatigue Headache Tenderness to touch Weakness generalized Swollen tonsils Tender glands Unable to blink or close eyelid The pain in your armpit and chest area sounds like Mono I know because I had it summer 2012 and i am getting it again or lymphoma It sounds like you are but get a pregnancy test and if you are not pregnant then it is the virus Im 34 and i just start to experience this same painim trying to get some answers myself Such pain can be caused by problems in either Liver or Gall Bladder or Colon Ascending or less frequently stomch duodenum  Any other associated complaints and area of tenderness will help in diagnosis For firm diagnosis please get a USG sonography done of upper abdomen which ehlp in diagnosing My mom has a herniated disc in her lower back and shes on two different pain meds She is on Fentynal patch and shes on Vicodin 5500mgs I dont think you can fix that Now to the other answer yes you can break your penis Its when you rip the muscle It may not be a bone but you can break your penis Ive heard a doctor tell a patient that its real hard to though If the pain is sharp and placed about a quarter of the way down the hip and to the back side of hip it could possibly be sciatic nerve issue A good Chiropractor can help no try Ibprophen Motrin aleve tylenol take an anti imflammatory pain reliever try ice packs heat packs to help with imflammation pain hip injuries stress or hyperextended over used muscles try an anti inflammatory pain reliever Yes One common side effect of narcotics can be sexual dysfunction including decreased desire and performance Medications like Viagra and Cialis may be able to help with performance but usually do not increase desire For most people if there is decreased desire they may not be inspired to have sex I remind patients that are on pain medications like narcotics that it is for quality of life and that if you dont need it at that time you may not have to take it Some people who do this may have improvement if their symptoms Based on your history I would seek medical attention Using Plan B twice could cause irregular bleeding but highly unlikely to cause severe suprapubic pain Since you are on the Nuva ring you should always insert the birth control even after using Plan B If you became pregnant of course your period would not come the following month but its best to stay on schedule with birth control If not you start to miss with your cycle which can cause scares Best thing to do would be take a pregnancy test first then call your OBGYN and have an appointment set up Also Plan B should only be used in emergency cases and is not safe to use every time a mishap comes along More Information If dye is involved you could be allergic to it  Might be gall bladder Could have something to do with a nerve issue I think you should consult with your doctor If they are not heart attacks it could be anxiety or panic attacks Immediately consult a doctor You may have a cracked bone I am not sure how to edit this question so I am posting it here Fiber is not an issue I get plenty of fiber in my diet I would say cater to her Put on a movie she likes make food she enjoys cuddle her Just try to be there for her the best you can Depending how bad shes feeling she may or may not respond positively to you efforts Dont be discouraged Deep down she knows she loves you and wants to feel good again and have good times again Just being there for her is huge Remind her shes not alone and you are in this fight against depression with her The doctors initially diagnosed me with Undefined Vertiginous or Labyrinthine syndrome but i dont feel the world moving or me rotating Slowly in about a week my BP came down to 13080 and has been normal since Since then my condition became better and these complaints reduced But since then twice my pulse rate suddenly shot up with the same throbbing feeling in the head I had my menopause 4 years back Also I was on steamed vegetablesraw foods diet in March Also I never used to burp but now I do quite frequently and acid also comes up with itAlso after switching to normal food for about 20 days my diaphragm kept fluttering The doctors said that there is nothing wrong with me medically But even after such a long time this is still not going What could possibly be wrong I did a little research for you my friend and it seems to be several things The one that might be above all is you might have a slipped disc in your Spine If it sometimes seems to radiate through your spine to one of your legs this could be an indication as well Try some yoga stretching and try to keep your spine in proper posture when this pain happens and see if it helps OR It could be gall stones which can cause the same type of pain However None of this will be as good as a physicians Xray of your back If you can afford to get it checked out  It would appear so It seems it has to do with the fact of hormone changes during your cycle After checking some forums for you It seems that it can be from several things I would if I were you check with my OBGYN to play it safe I I have the same issue pain starts in chest area goes into my back and finally working its way up into my jaw Sometimes I feel like I might be having a heart attack If I have one attack in a particular day I will have at least three I take a 12 hr Zantac but it rarely keeps the pain at bay for 2 hrs Many times I am awakened around 5 am with these symptoms Any idea if Gerd or acid reflux or gallbladder or hiatus hernia Did you ever get this figured out I have the same issue This is always a difficult question I always want to let patients know that the best thing for it is actually an icepack Get a package of frozen peas out of the freezer If you dont have one handy or available thats the best substitute if you dont have the gel pack or one of the ones you can instantly use The most important thing is to get that cold pack on it and then try to get out the stinger Thats really the key to relieving the pain There are topical anesthetic products like Dermoplast which is kind of a numbing spray you can use that too but ice usually takes care of it Monitor the site to make sure it doesnt continue to stay red or oozing and if you cant get the stinger out then you need to see a physician or another healthcare provider to help you get that out to avoid any type of infection But ice is really the key No butter mayonnaise things like that No condiments on the bee sting I would definitely recommend seeing a doctor or a healthcare provider One of the common causes of insomnia is pain and we all are realizing now that your level of pain is different than my level of pain and that could be the cause of it The other thing is what pain pills are we taking Are they taking a lot of acetaminophen or Tylenol Are they are also taking Motrin or ibuprofen What other sleep aids are they taking on top of that Do they realize that Tylenol PM has Tylenol in it on top of all these acetaminophen they are taking So we want to make sure that the healthcare provider or doctor is aware of this situation The pharmacist needs to be aware of this situation in case they are taking any prescription medications on top of it and their pain really needs to be assessed Even though they say its doing okay there are some prescription medications or they may have to go to physical therapy which should be better options for them and they may not have to rely on so many medications They may also not be feeling well in general The side effects from the medication the drowsiness or upset stomach could lead to bigger problems down the road So I would highly encourage that person to definitely consider seeing at least a primary care physician for just an evaluation and to make sure everything is in check This is a great question Osteo BiFlex is a very popular product Its actually a vitamin and herbal supplement It contains Glucosamine and Chondroitin Its supposed to help with joint pain Now there are studies that go back and forth as to whether or not it really works But one of the things that we dont really have is good data on does it interact with medications So once again I recommend it to patients that they need to have a medication list on them at all times that contains all their prescription medications as well as things like this So I can doublecheck to see We dont know longterm if it will interact with any of the medications but its fair to be safe and check it out and if they have any types of adverse reactions or breaking out in rashes or maybe the medications arent working as well it could be because they are interacting We do know that Osteo BiFlex can interact with certain diabetes medications and with blood thinners So once again we want to be really precautious about giving patients this particular overthecounter supplement Doctors physicians nurse practitioners physicians assistants everybody needs to know about everything that you are taking Its just that important This is a great question As a pharmacist I recommend each patient has what we call a medication list which is a list of all of your medications Use one pharmacy We have a lot of people who say they go to different pharmacies and what they dont understand is that I cant see the medications you are getting filled at other chains Or other independent pharmacies I only can see what you have filled in my particular store So I need that medication list to make sure that there is no duplications of therapy Similar medication that may have the same ingredients in them but dont realize because they have different names to them Get to know your pharmacist on a first name basis We are the medication experts thats why we went to pharmacy school All of our years are dedicated to learning about medications and how they work So when I am able to see all of this information I may be able to point out a few things and therefore call your doctor or healthcare provider and say by the way did you know that Dr such and such prescribed this they may have never been aware So there is a possibility that you could be taking too many medications Thats our role as a pharmacist is to look out for the patient make sure that you are safe and that you are taking your medications in the right way This does depend on the patient Some of my elderly patients they may last a little longer because they are slowing down a little bit So their body systems like their kidney and their liver are not working as well So they may have an effect thats a little bit longer as compared to you or me So pharmacists want to have a patient that comes to me that tells me about this particular medication and saying that its not working I have to ask him a few questions I want to find out if they are applying the patch in the right way Sometimes patients dont understand that they have to apply a patch to a certain area of the body They also may not understand that one of the things that they need to do is take off the patch that they shouldnt leave the other patch on and then put on another one So I tend to ask a lot of questions about how you are using this patch I will also ask them if they are keeping a diary about how their pain has been since they started it Now my skin is going to be different than your skin So patches the drug is actually absorbed through the skin and gives the effect So if your skin might be a little more thicker than mine it might take longer for that drug to pass In this case I also want to ask the patient if he has made the physician fully aware of how he is using the patch and maybe we need to switch him to a different company Because they all make different platforms of how the drug is absorbed into the skin so he might need a different type of patch Also maybe we need to increase the strength of the patch and see how he does on that So its a step wise approach and individualized therapy The physician probably wants to try this because at some point because of the past medication he was on he may have developed a tolerance to that medication and it wasnt really treating his pain So the doctor is probably looking at other options instead to make it a little more easier for the patient Valium is actually safe to continue to use especially when you are under a physician or healthcare provider supervision Its good to hear that it worked but you want to be careful about mixing it with other medications You also want to be careful about drinking alcohol with it because alcohol can make the drowsiness side effect more intense You want to take it when you need it and then see how you feel I always tell patients when they are using muscle relaxers that in some cases it might make you more tired than what you think So take it at home first before you go out driving or operating any type of machinery and see okay I am a little too tired I am not going to go to the store right now I am going to wait till I feel a little bit better about it But once again keep a diary to make sure that its working for you If you have some more side effects talk to your pharmacist We will look it up and see if thats a common side effect and possibly refer you back to your physician or healthcare provider Teething pain is very common and there are a few things that parents can do to help Give your baby a freezable teething ring or a pacifier that you can stick in the freezer The cold can help decrease the inflammation which is really what causes the pain Wet a washcloth with cool water and let baby gnaw on it a bit to relieve some pain and inflammation Massage your babys gums with your finger Infant acetaminophen Panadol Pediapap or Tylenol may help as well It will help with the pain wont cause any other sideeffects and baby may actually sleep a little bit better The FDA issued a warning about teething medications that contain benzocaine such as Anbesol Baby Orajel and Orabase They have advised parents and care takers not to use products with benzocaine in children younger than age 2 Benzocaine has been associated with a condition called methemoglobinemia that can affect a babys oxygen levels This is a great question Tylenol PM is actually not recommended in pregnancy because of the fact that not only does it contain Tylenol but it contains an antihistamine like Benadryl or Diphenhydramine And thats really not recommended for use in pregnant moms So you want to avoid that Tylenol is actually the safest painreliever to use in pregnant women but I want to make sure that you use it for shortterm used only And if you are going to take it make sure you check it out with your doctor first And if you have any questions come and ask us Codeine and hydrocodone can be very harsh on the stomach And a lot of people complain that it makes their stomach upset and that they dont feel right and that it contains a lot of pain in their stomach just alone If you have ulcers it definitely will probably be something that you would not want to use Because of the fact that you already have some type of irritation to your stomach So thats where you have to work with your physician on figuring out what might be some other alternatives There may be some pain medications that arent as harsh on the stomach that could be used In the case of using Tylenol thats okay But to be honest with you for severe back pain we might need to find out a little bit more And as the pharmacist I might actually ask this patient what other medications are they on Are they seeing a specialist Have they had scans done of an MRI or a CAT Scan to find out what is really causing the problems And based on that figuring out what medications may be appropriate working with their other physicians healthcare providers coming together and figuring out what might be the best treatments for this patient is probably the best answer Unfortunately spider bites have a tendency to cause infection and I believe we may be at this point in this situation This could be the start of cellulitis which is a bad skin infection I would advise seeing a health care provider as soon as possible An antihistamine like Benadryl will not help I would have your mouth looked at as soon as possible by a dentist There is a possibility that you could also have an infection due to the burn I would really like to ask how you feel and if this is taking care of the pain If you are still is pain have you spoken to your doctor or health care provider to let them know You should not take more than what was prescribed What we are finding out is that pain therapy has to be individualized and that is why its important to let your doctor or health care provider know if you are still experiencing pain  they may need to adjust your medications It is fine to take the naproxen and Robaxin together because they work differently to treat pain Good question I would need to ask some additional questions around why they are on an antibiotic and what kind of pain are they having and for how long I would then ask if they have a personal medication record so I can see what other prescription and overthecounter medications they are taking If acetaminophen seems like a proper choice I would advise taking it as directed on the package and make sure that you do not exceed the daily dose of 4000 mg Because you are allergic to most of the medications used to treat pain the only option that would be left is acetaminophen or Tylenol Thanks for submitting a question today Due to the fact that you have tried ibuprofen and that did not seem to help I am concerned with the level of pain that you are having and the area that you are having it in and strongly suggest that you see a health care provider for further evaluation It could be a sign of an infection and it is very important that you have this looked at Thanks for submitting a question today This caught my attention because I would like to ask what types of aches and pains have you been experiencing that you need to take this medication as frequently as you do Have you spoken to a doctor or health care provider about your pain and has it been evaluated There may be better options for you once you are evaluated I would like to know if you went to see a doctor or health care provider when you fell and if you are still seeing them It is very important that you advise them that you are still in pain so they can reevaluate your condition and possibly prescribe treatment At the end of the day your quality of life is the most important and if you are on the right medications it will actually help When pain is not treated properly it can cause other issues like insomnia and depression not to mention the fact that you may call out sick from work or not be able to focus on work  something that is called presenteeism This is a good question that you can always ask your pharmacist You can be on both of these medications at the same time I would recommend staying home if possible when you take your Relpax with the Norco so you can see how they make you feel it may be hard to distinguish between the possible side effects and a migraine Make sure that you carry a personal medication list that has all of your medications including overthecounter medications and make sure you show that list to your pharmacist doctor and other health care providers Shingles is tough because it typically requires evaluation by a doctor or health care provider and prescription medications to help speed the recovery and for the pain There are no overthecounter creams that can be used for the pain and stinging Great question Lorcet contains a different pain medication than Percocet so there could be a possibility that you are allergic to the Lorcet Stomach upset is common in pain medications so you can also try taking the medication with some food more of a meal rather than some crackers I would suggest that you talk to your health care provider about your reaction to Lorcet and also let your pharmacist know They can put a note in your profile about this reaction I would recommend going to the ER and have it checked out Chest pain and not being able to breathe could be signs of a heart attack Its better to be safe than sorry Make sure you advise them how long this has been going on for and what medications you took to try to resolve the problem Due to the fact that you have tried some overthecounter medications and it has been three days and you do not have any relief not able to drink or eat anything and still severe pain I would strongly recommend calling your doctor or health care provider as soon as possible or go to the ER to have it checked out This could be a sign of something serious As a pharmacist I have to ask who prescribed the pain medication and did they know you were pregnant Many motherstobe experience back pain when they are pregnant Vicodin is a pregnancy Category C drug which means we do not have data necessary to determine if it is OK or not I would call your doctor immediately and advise him if he was not the physician who wrote for the Vicodin in the first place When using a drug like Vicodin the risks and benefits have to be weighed If you have any questions about safe medications to use during pregnancy ask your pharmacist We are the medication experts Based on the fact that you are having so much pain and that you dont want to walk I would advise seeing a doctor or health care provider immediately This type of bite can lead to a serious skin infection so you want to have it checked out especially due to the pain It can be a warning sign of some type of infection How long has he had the pain I would also want to ask if he has had any blood in his stool because this could be the signs of an ulcer Has he been to the doctor recently and did he mention it I would recommend holding off on the PeptoBismol until we can get more information Minocycline is a medication that is typically used to treat skin conditions like acne Antibiotics should not be used to treat the common cold It will not have any benefit and due to the fact that we have been misusing antibiotics for things like the common cold we are running out of options for infections and very bad ones called superbugs The medication that you are on is a combination product that uses two medications to combat pain on two different levels Acetaminophen 660 mg is an effective pain reliever and is used in combination with the hydrocodone 10 mg You want to take the medication exactly as prescribed by your doctor or healthcare provider Shingles is tough because it typically requires evaluation by a doctor or healthcare provider and prescription medications to help speed the recovery and for the pain There are no overthecounter creams that can be used for the pain and stinging In the front I had pain and bloating for three years I tried all those medicines that I was prescribed I had an upper GI two ultrasounds two xrays a nuclear test and blood work No doctor could figure me out I tried their medicines I tried herbs and nothing seemed to work Finally I found mastic gum I started taking two in the morning along with Aloe Vera Within a week my pain was gone I have given mastic gum to a couple of other people who were miserable One of them had been off work for two months This guy was back to work the next week Another person who was having some testing done to figure out their problems took this stuff and the pain was gone within two hours I dont take it everyday anymore just when I need it I also try to eat very healthy and stay away from high fat foods especially I hope this helps I had a heel spur and surprisingly someone recommended wearing penny loafers The heal spur disappeared I have no idea why but hard soled shoes may be an answer It certainly helped me I just got cured of it less than 15 minutes ago Mine took 2 months and only because I just had it pop back in during my sleep I just woke up from feeling the same pull and hearing the same pop as I let out a high pitched shriek and instantly realized that I had lifted my arm up over my head same position of how I hurt it see below and I felt immediate relief Im right handed and it was my right arm so I was constricted from regular normal use for closing a car door and even sleeping Hi sorry to hear thatif its more than 2 days now and shes experiencing the same symptoms please take her to a doctor Im a mother of 4 grown children She may be lactose or casein intolerant which comes from many dairy products or it could be another form of stomach problem She may have caught a bug at school or have a virus Im sorry for your pain That severe muscle spasm in your lower back is what is most likely causing your pain I would get it check out by an Orthopedic since it may be a lower back as in bones not muscles probIem A long time ago my little brother had the tummy flu so my dad gave him a pitcher to throw up in but he threw up on the stupid bed Oh well Hes much better XD RIP guy thats fking gonna die soon Let me first start by saying I am not a doctor just your fellow WebMD follower and I have had Crohns Disease for 12 years and know a little something about bowel movements Two important questions My first question is is the blood red or black Red blood means there is irritation either from a hemorrhoid or rectal bleeding which generally is not concerning It either means you need to start drinking more water andor taking stool softeners You usually can tell if you need more water by bleeding and large hard stools My next question would be If the blood is black or the stool is tarry this is where you need to see a doctor This means there is bleeding up high in the colon or intestine a colposcopy is highly recommended I suspect what you are feeling is a large hemorrhoid when you feel inside Again I hate to say it but see a doctor andor stick to extra water stool softeners and continue with you yogurt as this will balance you physical therapy After surgical removal of the gallbladder it is possible to have a retained or recurrent stone in a bile duct such as the common bile duct CBD The CBD carries bile from the liver and gallbladder to the small intestine An ERCP endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography procedure is commonly performed in the treatment of bile duct stones Studies do not show that saw palmetto reduces prostatitis symptoms Saw palmetto has been shown in some small studies to help symptoms caused by an enlarged prostate benign prostatic hyperplasia These symptoms include weak urine stream and frequent urination There are other studies that do not show that saw palmetto is an effective treatment for these symptoms Prostatitis is sometimes but not always caused by an infection Often treatment will consist of several weeks to months of antibiotic therapy if it thought to be a result of infection Its good that you are seeing a Urologist for evaluation and treatment Your doctor should also be able to recommend treatment for your pain if you are not already taking pain medication httpmenwebmdcomtcprostatitistreatmentoverview Hypothyroidism underactive thyroid can cause many symptoms You asked about joint pain  yes joint pain and muscle aches can occur in people who are hypothyroid Other common symptoms of hypothyroidism include weight gain fatigue feeling cold constipation dry hair and skin and slow heart rate Here is a link to an article with more info httpwwwwebmdcomatozguideshypothyroidismunderactivethyroidsymptomscausestreatments Take care This is normal Your body is cold so it compensates by decreasing blood flow to your extremities hands and feet The redness and swelling is your body trying to warm its extremities by increasing blood flow The rewarding phase does hurt and depending on how cold you were it may hurt A LOT For me I get cold toes and fingers from the house being 68 degrees Put on some socks and a jacket or more layers if needed The black stool concerns me that often means you have a bleed in your upper GI Make appt to see your doc  My daughter who has not had a baby has the mirena too She was implanted about 1yr ago Had heavy bleeding for the 1st few months with huge clotting I actually would have to pull the clot out of her and took her to the dr with the samples Now she only spots for few days  sometime with clots and sometimes no clots I think since you stopped nursing your hormones are changing again and that why you started spotting My daughter sometimes spots or has a period I dont think anything is wrong Soon your uterus will adj to the medication and your periodsspotting will go away Thats what the dr informed us would happen wmy daughter She loves the mirena for the most part She doesnt like the thickened discharge or the spotting which comes and goes She doenst have her period anymore just spotting But its better than having a baby or hormones going through your whole body like the pill or depo With the mirena the hormones are confined to just your uterus Youll be fine  soon it will go awayit just take a litlle bit of time for your body to adj Hi it could be I would take himher to the vet as soon as possible Ten years old in dog years is about 60 or 70 in our years so it could just be starting The vet will do a thorough exam including xrays She may also recommend your love bug lose a few pounds Best wishes You should tell your doctor to run a Urinalysis to check for possible kidney infection I seriously doubt it but I guess it could be possible But very very unlikely I had mine out years ago Its an easy procedure these daysdont waitthe pain gets worse and the very micro stones that I had went down into my liver and I was not in good shape Dont put it offfind a surgeon Really late on answering this question but thought it might help others I had that some years ago and it was after being in the ER and having injections in my IV port which went directly into my arm It caused severe pain and I could feel the pain travel up my arm as the medication went in I had an ultrasound done some weeks later from the pain that didnt go away and I had what I call like a rubber band as tight as could be that you could feel from my fore arm all the way into my armpit I ended up with phlebitis and blood clots in my arm from it all I had to give myself 2 injections of lovenox a day for 2 weeks to dissolve the blood clots Go see your Doctor is my best advice YES any time you have chest pain to be safe get to the ER or Call your Dr I would go to ER this is not to be ignored  The kind of swelling youre describing doesnt sound typical to me at a guess Id say it may mean that you have an infection That doesnt necessary mean an STI BTW  it can be a typical gardenvariety infection But make an appointment to see a urologist so he or she can assess it live and in person and let you know how it should be treated Too many men decide to just ignore things like this because theyre embarrassed but keeping an eye on penis health is really important Guys need to check themselves out every day just to see if there are any changes that might indicate something It also can help to use a good penis nutrient cream health professionals recommend Man1 Man Oil regularly One with vitamin A can also help to fight penis odor a common problem for many men Good luck I have a device that I lay on floor and stretch my neck to help relieve some pain form bulging discs in neck You can get shots for rotator cuff pain How long the shots last is different with every individual Ive learned not to do certain things with my shoulder Surgery can fix them all but thats not an option at this time for me I take over the counter pain med dont want to start anything stronger thats up to every individual You might try going for an evaluation at a communitybased health clinic They offer comprehensive healthcare services on a sliding fee scale You can find a clinic by searching the US Health Resources and Services Administration website wwwfindahealthcenterhrsagovSearchHCCaspx There are ways of getting free or lowcost dental care When youre covered by a PPO and seek care outside of your insurers network you face higher costs Outofnetwork providers dont hold a contract with your insurer so the skys the limit in terms of what they can charge It sounds like this is a medical rather than a dental issue even though the pain may be in your mouth If thats the case Medicare should cover the cost of treatment I would contact Blue Cross and Blue Shield directly to discuss your situation and to see what steps you need to take to get the care you need covered through your Medicare benefits There are a few ways you can look into getting your dental needs taken care of at a lower cost Without insurance you can consider using an urgent care center in your neighborhood to have your condition checked out Youll generally pay a flat rate for the care you receive It doesnt replace a relationship with a doctor which you may need if you have a health condition that requires ongoing care but at least you can get some idea as to whats going on Without insurance you can consider using an urgent care center in your neighborhood to have your condition checked out Youll generally pay a flat rate for the care you receive It doesnt replace a relationship with a doctor which you may need if you have a health condition that requires ongoing care but at least you can get some idea as to whats going on Workers comp  I assume thats what WC stands for  operates differently than other types of medical insurance Health insurers cannot deny you coverage any longer because of a preexisting medical condition However care covered under workers comp functions differently Typically to be covered by workers comp your medical condition must be the result of an injury directly related to your work Your employer pays the bills for injuries or worsening physical condition caused by an injury that happened on the job If it can prove that you had the same condition prior to filing the claim your employer can argue that the condition already existed and is not the result of a workrelated injury In that case you may not receive coverage In that case you would need to have your condition covered by your health insurance assuming you have coverage Most doctors today are quite happy to accept cash instead of dealing with insurance companies so I dont have an answer for you as to why your offered is being turned down I cant speak to your clinical issues but you will have the chance to obtain health insurance again for next year starting November 15th Your situation is exactly the reason why even if were otherwise healthy having insurance is important  its often required for access to the care you need and it can prevent financial ruin I cant speak to your clinical issues but you will have the chance to obtain health insurance again for next year starting November 15th Your situation is exactly the reason why

just to the bottom of your ankles ice will relieve the pain 20 minutes on and 20 minutes off really helped me I am no expert but the stomach growling could be from the juice a lot of juice can cause things in your stomach to shift and resettle especially if it is helping in digestion The pain in your right side of your back could be gull not sure if this is spelled correctly stones My girlfriend had it recently though it caused her a lot of pain at times The doctor said that gull stones can shift either up or down and get stuck there causing pain They told us that if it persisted that she would need to get her gull bladder removed because it can cause an infection in her pancreas if the stones didnt dislodge and return to normal Again she had sever pain and they only told us if it persists that that would need to be done Do you take Stool Softeners or Laxitivesr eat a lot of Fiber Too much Fiber or raw fruits and vegetables will cause gas and bloating in the lower bowel Sometimes it becomes trapped between stool that you are unable to pass If this continues you might see a good Specialist You may have a condition that would cause this problem that could be easily treated with the right medications Possible Neuropathy in Hands and joints You should be checked by a Specialist to get the right diganosis I had terrible buring in my toes and feet I am not Diabetic but have Severe Nerve Damage to my Spinal Nerves and Spina Biffida Occulta After seeing a Specialist I was diaganosed with Neuropathy of Both legs and Feet caused by Nerve Damage and Chronic Sciatic hello there firstly congrats on being independent and living on your own its a big step but a great one and at times yes you may feel down or irritated but this can all be helped your anxiety can also be controlled and personally i think you should be doing this through eating the right foods including lots of raw fruit and vegetables dairy free milk such as oat milk soy milkalmond milk or if you do not like that at least low or no fat milk cut out on all processed foods that contain presertitives flavours or flavor enhancers artificial colors added sugar and high salts this all has effects on the body and is UNnatural just changing what you eat will help your thought processes decent exercise is also a great way to relieve anxiety and depression DOING GOOD WILL MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD and lots of good uninterupted sleep is very important too at least 810 hours i dont think the Zoloft is doing you any good these are synthetic chemicals that do more damage to your head and body in the long run join a yoga class or do some volunteer work getting out and meeting people will make you feel good try to learn something new everyday and keep your mind active dont let bad thoughts get in the way of enjoying this precious life you have hope this helps you in some way  keep positive sounds like your rib is out of place I have had this many times it is very painful i usually push on it to pop it in place or go to my chiropractor for an adjustment I think it would be a good idea to be seen i hope its nothing but you may have nerve damage I have the same problen with my shin the skin is numb to the pint where I scratch it and dont feel it if I press on my upper inner thigh it tingles and starts to hurt very bad in my ankle and shin area and once it starts to tingle and itch I have to try so hard not to scratch it or it starts to hurt really bad You can get a pregnancy test with a 99plus percent accuracy rate online for less than 10 Why not just buy one and find out for sure I paid less than 9 total for mine from a site called httpwwweganmedicalcom Im pretty sure they recommend you wait at least 24 hours although it would be optimum to quit  sometimes that is a little harder said than done I was lucky to make it one hour when I smoked lol  Chronic pelvic pain can be caused by various problems Certain underlying causes of chronic pelvic pain such as endometriosis  pelvic inflammatory disease PID and fibroids can affect a womans ability to get pregnant However other causes do not The first step is to talk to your doctor about your symptoms If the cause of your pain is identified your doctor can recommend treatment for the underlying cause This often improves symptoms and helps avoid complications such as infertility If the cause isnt identified your doctor can provide treatment recommendation to manage the pain It would be best to discuss this with your primary orthopedics doctor Given your medical history of knee problems and procedures it may be helpful to get a second opinion from another orthopedics doctor Having copies of your previous MRI reports and medical records that you can share with the doctor would also be helpful You could have a Meniscus TearInflammation This happened to me a while back My treatment was cortisone shots every couple of weeks until the inflammation died down If it is very painful and chronic you can get an operation to fix it this is assuming that is the issue You could have an hernia I would have it checked out by your physician Most beds tend to conform to your body not really supporting the spinal chord I would say a very soft bed can be detrimental while a firm bed would be better Hard to tell and also depends on your body type if you are overweight etc I had a total knee replacement in March of 2010 and I too had some swelling it will go away with lots of Physical therapy exercise and lots of ice Try Yoga The knots are due more than likely to stress So Yoga is a way to let go of stress and probably do something nice for your heart too i am a yoga guru in India Been in the field for 12 yrs I also have been suffering from arthritis for some time  in the neck  hands and low back Believe me I am not taking any medicine I have been able to manage only with Yogaanasas Yoga nidra or Corpe poseYou have to learn from an expert and not self learn It is a good pain reliever It might be arthritis Turn to Yoga practice and you will find good relief from the pain POSSIBLE BOWEL BLOCKAGE I HAD A SIMILAR PROBLEM BACK WHEN I WAS 12 DO U REMEMBER WHEN UR LAST BOWEL MOVEMENT WAS So much more needs to be known if you dont mind answering Age Exercise body type prior injuries stroke blood pressure take herbs repetitious movements IE sports work those are all symptoms of a migraine if you havent been diagnosed with them see a neurologist Its fallin off buddy Try switching formula All natural may cost more but will keep you out of the Droffice Shaklee has amazing products If I was you since you said an ER Dr I would seek a SPECIALIST Go see an OBGYN first and if needed they will send you to another Professional i have same problem except i use to get wet before i had a hysterectomy but i have never had an orgasm either and if i did i did not reconize it It sounds like internal hemrroids When bowel passes through the spincter muscles it could be causing the pain Hi It can simply be heartburn but you should definately not ignore this If you expierience chest pains you should go to an emergency room as soon as possible Especially if its happening often Sweetie I would not waste anytime at all you need to see a doctor ASAP No sweetie it is not normal and I would say that you need to go see a different dientest because apparently she doesnt know what shes talking about At your age darlin I would say NO Have your parents take you to a foot specialist and possibly have special orthopedic shoes made Good luck God Bless Possibly stress related I would take NO chances I would go to your family doctor and ask them to see possibly a cardiologist Better to be safe than sorry Good luck Strress but I would take NO CHANCES get in and have a cat scan Can cause that and or constipation consult your doctor and possibly change to something else before things get worse Short answer yes Once you break something it will NEVER heal 100 Maybe 99 but never fully It has been 4 years since my fermus accident and it still hurts on some days The best thing to do is to talk with your Dr and take some sort of physical therapy The pain will decrease as long as nothing is still wrong Now if you have worse pain TALK TO YOUR DR Something could still be wrong or you could have had a reinjury Adderall is not associated with the side effects you mentioned MS Contin may cause swelling of the hands and feet as a side effect However it is not associated with causing joint pain I suggest you talk to your healthcare professional if you are having symptoms that are bothersome Yes it is safe to take acetaminophen with Vyvanse There are no drug interactions You should always ask your pharmacist before taking any over the counter medication to be sure it is right for you She would have to speak with her obgyn to find out what she can take while pregnant While some overthecounter medications are considered safe in pregnancy different doctors have different rules on what they allow their patients to take To answer your question I would need to know which medications you take for heart failure and how severe your heart failure is Vicodin and other narcotic pain relievers can cause breathing difficulties if you take too much People with congestive heart failure who often already have breathing difficulties may be more prone to that side effect In reference to your question about specific drug interactions I would need a list of your medications to answer that question I suggest you talk to your pharmacist who has a list of all your current medications and can discuss the potential for drug interactions with you If your husband is experiencing pain and fatigue that is new and unusual he should be examined by his doctor to make sure everything is OK and his diabetes is being managed appropriately A basic multivitamin is usually OK to take  Also you should make sure he is eating a healthy and wellbalanced diet that contains fruits and vegetables This is the best way to get all your vitamins and minerals Mobic can be taken safely with those two medications There are no significant interactions between the medications you listed Mobic is an antiinflammatory medication and does have a slight tendency to raise blood pressure when taken regularly So it is important to watch your blood pressure while you are taking it I am sure your doctor will be monitoring for that Also to avoid dangerous drug interactions its always important to have all your prescriptions filled at the same pharmacy so the pharmacist has access to all the information he or she needs to take the best care of you Also new prescriptions will be screened against all the other medications you are taking to ensure there are no problems Robaxin is a muscle relaxer and it can be taken with ibuprofen to relieve pain There are no significant interactions The three OTC pain relievers available are acetaminophen ibuprofen and naproxen None of these interacts with amlodipine So any of them would be considered safe to use for shortterm management of pain or fever Ibuprofen and naproxen when taken chronically for pain can raise blood pressure In this case acetaminophen would be best There is more to consider in finding the right pain reliever than just the other medications you take I would suggest you talk to your pharmacist who can evaluate your entire situation and help you find the best pain reliever for your needs see a doctor right away you may be allergic to it Could it be allergies Could it be the Sciatica wat is tht frist word me im srry im not used to big words lol There are several types of pain associated with PD Hip or shoulder pain  particularly on the side most affected by PD  may be an early sign of PD However other joint pain is likely from arthritis Muscle pain from PD may be divided into a cramping type pain usually from a wearing off from medications or stiffness from lack of medications Treatment includes medication adjustment and exercise  particularly light stretching Facial and jaw pain is common in FM Several structures including the head scalp and brain neck TMJ and facialjaw muscles all have nerve branches to the face that can lead to pain numbness and altered sensations called dysesthesias If the pain comes and goes in relationship to another area of pain ie TMJ jaw neck then it may be referred pain from myospasms or TM joint etc If it comes spontaneously and feels like shocks or stabs then it could be more neuralgiamediated like trigeminal neuralgia Rarely in someone with FM a different cause such as MS Bells palsy acoustic neuroma or even a viral infection cold can cause face and jaw pain But these other conditions are usually evident by additional symptoms or a different clinical course that your doctor can determine by evaluating you I try various treatments on my patients with facial pain including meds that block nerve pain ie antiseizure meds SNRIs serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors tricyclics and topicals with helpful meds patches compounded cream Therapies including TNS trail or injections or bite splints or other treatments can be tried depending on the individuals cause of pain As usual I cant provide specific advice for anyone here but I encourage you to work together with your doctor for your symptoms Leg pains are very common in FM including referred pain nerve pain restless leg syndrome and muscle spasm pain Other causes of leg pain can include disc problems pinched nerves peripheral neuropathy vascular disease joint disease etc Could prior work injuries could be involved Please have your doctor look over any new or persistent pain problems Antidepressents are known to help FM pain in many people Theres been an accumulating body of medical evidence demonstrating how different antidepressant meds selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors serotoninnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors like Effexor and tricyclic antidepressants can help decrease FM pain Its common for patients not to first realize how much a med may be helping until they go off of it They may understate or underappreciate the meds painrelieving benefit while on it but realize it must have been working because the pain level escalates once off the med Discuss with your doctor possible additional medicine strategies Steroid shots can help fibro pain for several reasons 1 They reduce pain in the inflamed areas from conditions other than fibro thus one feels better overall 2 They calm down these inflamed areas thus reducing the signals that were aggravating the fibro in the immediate areas and even the overall body so indirectly the steroids calmed the fibro 3 They may directly calm down the fibro flareup perhaps by combined analgesic antiinflammatory and adrenal mechanisms involving FM   Great idea on starting a food log Since you have both nerve damage and fibromyalgia you are going to have to ease change into your life So you dont stir your symptoms up Also a quick phone call to your doctor to make sure they are OK with you exercising would be a good first step as well After you have your doctors OK here are a few ideas These type of exercise bikes have a chair seat and are much more comfortable for individuals with back problems Start slow with just 5 minutes three times a week then as your tolerance builds add a second session of 5 minutes later in the day until eventually you can work up to either 215 minute sessions a day or 310 minute sessions a day By splitting your sessions up that should make you more comfortable and avoid aggravating your spine and your fibromyalgia By moving in water your heart and muscles get the benefits of exercise without all the stress on your spine Look around your community and Im sure you will find a number of places that offer these On the day of your first class arrive early and explain to the instructor your limitations so they can provide you with some modifications to exercises that might exacerbate your problem Click on the hyperlink below to be taken there Youll find tons of info on how to maximize your health There is also a community forum that enables you to talk with others with fibromyalgia that way you can find ideas and strategies that worked for them Pick one item and work on it then when youve mastered that move onto the next item For example now that writing down what you eat is a habit pick another oneexercise for example Call around and find a water aerobics class and set a goal of attending 2 classes a week Once youve completed that goal then pick anothersleep for example After you visit the fibromyalgia center you will be amazed how many people are living active lives and managing their symptoms You can definitely lose weight just take it slow Karly This is not a question that can be answered in this format You really need to set up an appointment with your doctor and discuss it with them Sorry This is DEFINATELY hypochondriayou DONT have ALS I thought I did too and it led to me believing a load of other things Stop thinking about it and you will be fine But if your still worried get a check up at the doctors office so they can assure you that you are fine which worked for me The flow issues you report are actually quite common and believe it or not in general have little to do with our estrogen levels going down Actually the first thing that happens to many women is that we stop ovulating real well and we stop making progesterone very well progesterone is the hormone our ovaries make after we ovulate I describe progesterone to my patients as the policeman of the lining of the uterus  estrogen causes the lining of the uterus to grow and without police action you can get some very crazy bleeding patterns  too frequent not coming regularly and very heavy flow when they do come One of the ways we actually can manage the crazy flow is with progesterone Often gynecologists will suggest to our patients that we give them 12 days or so of progesterone every two or three monthsif they havent had a period That will cause the lining of the uterus to think you have ovulated when you stop taking the progesterone the uterus will say time for a clean out  but since youve taken the progesterone you should have a reasonably controlled bleed Another way we often deal with these issues in nonsmokers are lowdose birth control pills  especially if one is having hot flashes etc and crazy periods Now the kicker here is I dont know what to make of your chest pain Chest pains can be related to menopause however women do start experiencing more true cardiac issues around the time of menopause So I would check in with your primary care medical doc who may even suggest you check in with a cardiologist  presuming they do rule out heart disease then you can proceed on the attack the menopause front Again help should be available for all of your problems no I have not started taking the Chantix yet but the medication that I received from the Pfizer Patient Assistance Foundation has 3 bottles of blue pills and I keep reading the posted direction attached to the medication reading

this article  The best thing to do is have her see her pediatrician It could be her teeth or another issue like reflux or oralmotor problems Shortterm decreases in food intake are usually not a problem but if its causing her food intake to decrease permanently or causing food aversions you need to take action Two year olds cannot always communicate what exactly is going on with them Good luck I have the same problem Dont really remember hurting my leg but have had an indentation on it for a couple of years and seems to be getting deeper It is bruised and is always feels hotter than the rest of my leg It normally donst hurt but lately when I walk sometimes I can feel the pull on my shin with slight pain Nipple pain is a common in women who are pregnant or breastfeeding The nipples may become more sensitive and tender during pregnancy Poor latchon by the baby when breastfeeding can also cause nipple pain In women who are not pregnant or lactating nipple pain may be due to skin abrasion from tightfitting bras or other clothing or dry skin around the nipple More serious causes of nipple pain include infections Pagets disease of the breast or certain forms of breast cancer If nipple pain doesnt go away in two weeks or if you also have nipple discharge call your doctor Yes Chest pain has many possible causes some are harmless but some like a heart attack can be lifethreatening Part of the problem is that the heart and other internal organs have a type of sensory nerve conduction where it is sometimes difficult to precisely pinpoint the exact origin of a painful sensation Pain due to something wrong in the heart lungs or belly can be vague or feel like something else This is why chest pain can be such a difficult problem for those who have it as well as for their doctors Gas causes swelling in the intestines and a bloated feeling When gas causes pain its usually in the abdomen belly However the pain may also be felt in the chest If pain is due to gas it should go away within a short time Other causes of chest pain not due to the heart include problems with the esophagus gastroesophageal reflux disease GERD musculoskeletal chest wall pain problems in the lungs and many others Studies have shown that even doctors have a hard time identifying the cause of chest pain just through conversation or physical examination Laboratory tests a chest Xray and an electrocardiogram are generally needed to know for sure that chest pain is nothing serious No one wants to call 911 or sit in an emergency room to be treated for what turns out to be gas pain However playing a waiting game when you are having chest pain can be a gamble with your health or maybe your life If youre having chest pain in almost all cases a doctors recommendation will be to seek medical attention Yes  CIP also known as  is one or more rare conditions where a person cannot feel and has never felt physical pain Paitents with this dissorder can still feel touch they just can not feel pain It is a neurological problem You should get checked out by a neurologist to make sure everything is okay what other possible antibiotics are used for this  In caring for patients with chest pain the doctor distinguishes whether the pain is related to a lack of oxygen to the heart muscle as in angina or heart attack or is due to another process Many conditions are considered that can cause similar chest pain Examples include Pleuritis pleurisy Inflammation of the lining of the lungs pleuritis causes sharp chest pain which is aggravated by deep breathing and coughing Patients often notice shortness of breath in part due to their shallow breathing to minimize chest pain Viral infections are the most common causes of pleurisy Pericarditis Pericarditis is inflammation of the lining around the heart Symptoms of pericarditis are similar to that of pleuritis Pneumonia  Pneumonia bacterial infection of the lung causes fever and chest pain Chest pain in bacterial pneumonia is due to an irritation or infection of the lining of the lung Pulmonary embolism Pulmonary embolism refers to blood clots traveling from the veins of the pelvis or the lower extremities to the lung Pulmonary embolism can cause death of lung tissue pulmonary infarction Some common causes of blood clots in these veins is deep vein thrombosis Pneumothorax Small sacs in the lung tissue alveoli can spontaneously burst causing pneumothorax Symptoms of pneumothorax include sudden severe sharp chest pain and shortness of breath One common cause of pneumothorax is severe emphysema Mitral valve prolapse Mitral valve prolapse is a common heart valve abnormality affecting 5 to 10 of the population Chest pain with MVP is usually sharp but not severe Unlike angina chest pain with MVP rarely occurs during or after exercise and usually will not respond to nitroglycerin Aortic dissection The aorta is the major vessel delivering blood from the left ventricle to the rest of the body Aortic dissection tearing of the aorta wall is a lifethreatening emergency Aortic dissection causes severe unrelenting chest and back pain Costochondritis rib fractures muscle strain or spasm Pain originating from the chest wall is usually sharp and constant It is usually worsened by movement coughing deep breathing and direct pressure on the area Muscle spasm and strain can result from vigorous unusual twisting and bending The joints between the ribs and cartilage next to the breastbone can become inflamed a condition called costochondritis Fractured ribs resulting from trauma or cancer involvement can cause significant chest pain Nerve compression Compression of the nerve roots by bone spurs as they exit the spinal cord can cause pain Nerve compression can also cause weakness and numbness in the upper arm and chest Shingles herpes zoster infection of the nerves Shingles is nerve irritation from the infection which can cause chest pain days before any typical rash appears Esophageal spasm and reflux The esophagus is the long muscular tube connecting the mouth to the stomach Reflux or regurgitation of stomach contents and acid into the esophagus can cause heartburn and chest pain Spasm of the muscle of the esophagus can also cause chest pain Gallbladder attack gallstones Gallstones can block the gallbladder or bile ducts and cause severe pain of the upper abdomen back and chest Anxiety and panic attacks Anxiety depression and panic attacks are frequently associated with chest pain lasting from minutes to days The pain can be sharp or dull It is usually accompanied by shortness of breath or the inability to take a deep breath Since there is no test for panic attacks patients with chest pain usually undergo tests to exclude coronary artery disease and other causes of chest pain The treatment of neck pain depends on its precise cause Treatment options include rest heat or cold applications traction soft collar traction physical therapy ultrasound massage manipulation local injections of cortisone or anesthetics topical anesthetic creams topical pain patches muscle relaxants analgesics and surgical procedures Home remedies for treatment such as Jacuzzi treatment neck pain relief exercises and stretches and neck pain relief products such as neck pillows for sleep and hot pads can be very beneficial for relief of some forms of neck pain There are many treatment options depending on the particular neck problem and past treatment experiences Alternative treatments that have been used for chronic neck pain include acupuncture Neck pain is commonly associated with dull aching Sometimes pain in the neck is worsened with movement of the neck Other symptoms associated with some forms of neck pain include numbness tingling tenderness sharp shooting pain fullness difficulty swallowing pulsations swishing sounds in the head dizziness or lightheadedness and lymph node gland swelling Neck pain can also be associated with headache facial pain shoulder pain and arm numbness or tingling upper extremity paresthesias These associated symptoms are often a result of nerves becoming pinched in the neck For example compressing the nerve of sensation to the back of the head which comes out of the neck causes headaches in the back of the head Depending on the condition sometimes neck pain is accompanied by upper back andor lower back pain as is common in inflammation of the spine from ankylosing spondylitis Methadone is used both for treating pain and for treating narcotic addiction In order to prescribe it to treat addiction the physician must have special certification from the DEA Drug Enforcement Administration However any licensed physician may prescribe methadone to treat pain Methadone is a very effective drug for treating chronic pain However it has unique characteristics that separate it from the other pain pills which has prompted warnings from the FDA The FDA has noted that the pain relief from methadone lasts about 48 hours but the drugs elimination from the body is much slower taking up to a week This means that if you rapidly increase your methadone dose the methadone can accumulate in the body with the risk of stopping breathing Further methadone is associated with abnormalities in heart rhythm potentially leading to death In addition the breakdown of methadone in the liver is very complex and interactions with the metabolism of other drugs can lead to changes in the blood level of both the methadone and the other drugs Finally methadone is secreted in breast milk and can be passed on to nursing infants Prolonged appropriate use of any opioid including OxyContin for a legitimate medical purpose can lead to a situation where you might undergo withdrawal if you stop the medication This situation should not be considered addiction It is a normal response to the use of the medication There are many medications we use which should be tapered off slowly discontinued when no longer required For example if you are on steroids certain high blood pressure medicines or antiseizure medications these drug dosages should be slowly reduced tapered rather than abruptly discontinuing the drug This is a medical issue and should be handled by your prescribing doctor In like manner tapering off of your OxyContin is a medical issue and should be handled by your doctor in case you do have any withdrawal symptoms There are many ways to wean off of medications Generally if you have time gradually lowering the dosage of the drugs is the easiest Rehabilitation centers tend to focus on people who are taking the medication because they have a craving for the opioids where they give up social activities because of the opioid use and center their life around getting the drugs  rehabilitation centers focus on people who are addicted As a rule people who are taking the opioids for a medical reason dont need to go to rehabilitation centers to get off the opioids If they do it is because they find the withdrawal symptoms to be a problem rather than that they need the support to control any desire to keep taking the medications Abdominal pain is pain that is felt in the abdomen The abdomen is an anatomical area that is bounded by the lower margin of the ribs and diaphragm above the pelvic bone pubic ramus below and the flanks on each side Although abdominal pain can arise from the tissues of the abdominal wall that surround the abdominal cavity such as the skin and abdominal wall muscles the term abdominal pain generally is used to describe pain originating from organs within the abdominal cavity Organs of the abdomen include the stomach small intestine colon liver gallbladder spleen and pancreas Occasionally pain may be felt in the abdomen even though it is arising from organs that are close to but not within the abdominal cavity For example conditions of the lower lungs the kidneys and the uterus or ovaries can cause abdominal pain On the other hand it also is possible for pain from organs within the abdomen to be felt outside of the abdomen For example the pain of pancreatic inflammation may be felt in the back These latter types of pain are called referred pain because the pain does not originate in the location that it is felt Rather the cause of the pain is located away from where it is felt Hi Sorry to hear about your husband I too have been passing out at the oddest times often hurting myself Ive been to a Neurologist have had an MRI EEG Now I am working with a Sleep Specialist FINALLY maybe he has some answers for me This has been driving me insane for almost a year now Its not like I go to sleep and get up and sleepwalk These incidents happen during the day and evening when I am usually wide awake This specialist is accredited important and has ordered another Sleep Study for me I need to get this done ASAP as I need to have some surgery done and the surgeon will not put me under anesthesia unless the Sleep Specialist clears me If it matters I am also in remission from two different forms of cancer  LymphomaHodgkins Disease and Invasive Squamous Cell Carcinoma I feel like  you name it Ive had it  Any way I hope this may be helpful in some way Sleep Specialists dont just deal with issues than happen while youre in bed sleeping Best of luck to you and your husband Melissa Hi I would suggest asking for a different class of pain meds There are a plethora of choices I believe it might also make a difference as to when you take the med Is it labeled take with food or take on empty stomach Also the inert properties within the Tramadol pill or capsule that you could be allergic to I realize this may not be much of an answer but I hope it helps Also I hope you feel better soon Melissa  I am glad that you are feeling better Earaches can be pretty miserable An earache often follows a cold or allergy flareup Heres what happens Normally the middle ear is kept free of fluid by a tiny tube called the Eustachian tube This tube drains the fluid out of the middle ear into the back of the throat A cold or allergy can cause this tube to become inflamed and swollen This traps fluid in the middle ear behind the eardrum This fluid can then get infected with bacteria or viruses causing pressure and pain Earaches often do get better on their own after a few days But often some of the fluid is left behind This fluid can again become a breeding ground for another infection It can also interfere with your hearing WebMD has a good slideshow that shows exactly what happens with an ear infection Have your doctor take a look to see what is going on Depending on the cause there may be medications or prescription nasal sprays that can help If this is a persistent problem ask to see an ear nose and throat specialist Rarely a tube may need to be inserted into the eardrum to get rid of the fluid I am very sorry to hear that you are sick but your specific question is not one that can be answered in this type of information forum If you have had diarrhea for 4 days and are having severe pain you really do need to see a doctor now Symptoms such as this can have many causes ranging from a virus food poisoning or diverticulitis all the way to a surgical emergency There is no way to tell what is going on without a physical exam and more information Any treatment will depend on what is causing your symptoms Start by calling your family doctor now Explain your symptoms Tell the doctor that you are unemployed and are having money problems Most doctors that I know will try to help you by reducing the fee or working out some type of payment plan He or she will also know what resources are available in the area and can give you further advice If you do not have a family doctor your city or county may have a free clinic But this will only help you if you can be seen right away Some areas have urgent care centers that may be able to see you right away for a fee If there is no way that you can see a doctor right now then you can go to the emergency room of your local hospital Once this health crisis has passed look into whether you can get help from the government You are eligible for Medicare If you are over 65 If you are younger and meet certain financial criteria you may be able to get medical assistance I hope you get the help you need now I do not speak professionally on this topic but I have also been seeing doctor for a yr with plantar fasciitis followed by pain on top of foot In my case there is a subchondral cyst that caused fracture of 4th metatarsal which only showed up on MRI not x rays Stick with all follow ups until you determine the cause of pain I was told yes that its normal for a couple days after gallbladder removal For most people a knee replacement can predictably eliminate pain and restore function This is not to say that the operation is not without complications I think that we as physicians do a good job of presenting these complications to the patient preoperatively but I am not sure that we are always great at preparing our patients for the recovery after knee replacment The first couple of weeks can often be very challenging and the patient is truly doing a lot of work in physical therapy They likely are requiring pain meds antiinflammation medications and icing in between and around the therapy sessions We often generalize and tell patients they are about 75 percent recovered at 68 weeks and that they will continue to make some improvement often out to at least one year All patients are different and this schedule does not apply to all Unfortunately there are some patients some research has suggested approximately 1 in 5 that may have some pain in there knee after the surgery and when the recovery is complete Most of these patients are better than they were preoperatively but still not 100 percent pain free Mild back pain will often resolve on its own without seeing a doctor However if the pain doesnt start getting better after a day or two call your doctor If its slowly getting better but you still have pain after a couple of weeks call your doctor as you may need treatment to help it resolve If youre having any other symptoms with your back pain including chest pain or the pain is severe youre unable to move part of your body or you have weakness tingling or numbness in an arm or leg see your doctor In other words if you just have mild to moderate back pain no other symptoms and you can relate it to a specific injury it should resolve on its own Of course any time youre concerned about any symptoms at all call your doctor Heres information on how to treat back pain at home  There are many potential causes to this including a nerve problem Given how long its lasted and the fact that is hasnt gone away its time to get your doctor to check you out You need to have an examination by your doctor to determine what followup tests you may need to get to the bottom of the pain As you said these arent typical headaches and the description of your symptoms does not automatically point to something in particular There are many possible causes of kidney pain Your doctor would need to examine you to figure out whats going on The description of your symptoms does not point to any obvious cause of your pain so call your doctor and get checked My best guess would also be gas which can cause strange symptoms if the gas gets caught in an area of your intestines or colon Of course the best way to get to the bottom of it is doing exactly what youre doing The colonoscopy will tell if there is anything going on with your colon The CT scan looks at the entire abdomen so it doesnt appear there is any obvious structural problem If the colonoscopy doesnt find anything and you continue to have the problem the next step may be an endoscopy which looks at the stomach and esophagus You just have to go through a process of elimination to see if something pops up as possibly causing the sensation But the description of your symptoms doesnt bring anything else in particular to mind at this point You definitely should see your doctor The shortness of breath is a concern and you dont want to ignore that In addition your lack of bowel movements and change in size of stool is also something that should be checked by your doctor I would go ahead and make an appointment so you can get to the bottom of whats happening Shingles is contagious so there is the potential that you could pass the virus to one of your patients particularly babies and children or adults who have not either had the chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine As long as you have new blisters appearing you are contagious You should likely avoid contact with patients during this time as it will be difficult to know if theyre immune Once all the blisters have crusted over and no new ones are forming you are no longer contagious and can return to normal work duties You can ask your doctor about antiviral medicines for shingles as that may help shorten the duration so that you can safely return to work sooner The symptoms you describe can be signs of early pregnancy I have no way of knowing if this is it or what your GP suggests which is also a possibility A few days after conception the fertilized egg attaches itself to wall of the uterus This can cause one of the earliest signs of pregnancy  spotting and sometimes cramping Thats called implantation bleeding It occurs anywhere from six to 12 days after the egg is fertilized The bleeding and cramps however are slight Heres more information on pregnancy symptoms I can suppose that you have intervertebral hernia It would be better if you go to the doctor and get MRI The pain on ur right side could b a number of things Such as gallbladder appendix ovarian cysts kidney infection or uti Tylenol isnt gd for u to b taking all the time it can cause liver damage Go to the Doctor possible infection I had a friend who had his knee replaced and it took approx 69 months before pain went away completely Remember you have a foreign object in your body The body needs time to adjust If it continues for a long period of time after done exercising yes otherwise its prolly just your muscles U R Dehydrated Drink fluids mainly water i suggest I have an insect bite that is spreading outside of the wound It could be Endometriosis It runs on my moms side of the family quite heavily most of my aunts had it and my mom had it the only thing i know to do is see a gyno tell them your pain im almost 21 and was told that i have beginning stages of it since im now pregnant i dont have periods and no pain but i have to be checked out after i have my daughter I remember my mom being in loads of pain they put her on birth control that didnt work they gave her hormone injections and that didnt work so finally they did surgery so my advice is see a gyno get checked out and go from there good luck If at all possible see a doctor ASAP kind of sounds like Swimmers ear i had it a lot growing up water gets trapped and cant be expelled have her lay on the bed or couch on her side with her sore ear facing up try putting a cap full of rubbing alcohol and vinegar in it until it feels like it drained in her ear then have her flip her head over and lay on her ear for about a minute if that doesnt work you can try it again if it doesnt work then go to the ER because loss of hearing is something serious i hope this link helps httpwwwwikihowcomRemoveWaterfromEars Hope this helps httpwwwwebmdcomatozguidesbrokennose i would call here obgyn and schedule an app i am having some chest pain as well it started with swelling about a week ago and the pain seems to be getting worse everyday my breast is burning and feels very heavy i am more tired than usual and my armpit is sore also This is very normal There are lots of nerves associated with the teeth and mouth so swelling and pain is to be expected Quit agitating itIt came from some type of medication with sodiumReduce your sodium intake gradually Chryrosurgery might alleviate it with Floxin antibiotic seek a certified OBGYN Have her blood tested for leukemia God bless I have been in your position and I know how you feel however I am going to repeat what my Dr whom I get suboxone from told me just last week Then you will have the information to make a educated decision It is illegal to prescribe suboxone to anyone who is pregnant The program that I have been in for over a year caught alot of heat when one of the patients who had been taking suboxone was found out to be pregnant I understand that you are worried about the withdrawal affecting the fetus but if you are getting through 28 days of the month without taking anything I doubt you would withdrawal if you stopped taking those 2 suboxone Your body starts going into withdrawals once the medicine has left your system if I skip a day of my suboxone I can tell the next day by how my body reacts If you are really taking 2 a month you would be going weeks at a time without taking anything Your body would have already adjusted to not having the suboxone in your system Your just starting the cycle over again when u take one This seems like an odd amount to be taking and feeling like you really need them However Im not gonna judge your situation I do know from doing research that their are other medicine options for people who are addicted and pregnant I read online that some addicts are prescribed methadone when they are pregnant instead of suboxone Im not sure how accurate that statement is but if you really need something you could google it and see what others have been prescribed Regardless once ur due date approaches I am sure that most Drs lower ur dose and try to wean you off any medicine at all otherwise your baby will be born addicted to meds as well It will be in your babys system when they are born and they will have withdrawals once they are not in your womb anymore and not getting their dose of medicine through you I would consider all of this and decide what option works for you if your worried now your concern will only get worse the further along you get Guilt is a hard thing to live with My daughter plays fast pitch softball and had the same symptoms She caught a line drive up the middle and flung it side armed at 1st She said she felt a pop When it didnt go away after two days we took her to a orthopedic He said it was strained and would be fine after a two week rest After the rest she was pitching and she caught another line drive on the pitchers mound She felt something pull and we noticed her arm slump and she said she couldnt move it We took her to a different doctor He did a MRI that showed a tear in her Labrumthe ligament that holds the arm in the socket If you continue to have this issue and they havent checked that yet you may want to ask the doc about it If she tears hers again she will have to have surgery I wish you good luck and a speedy recovery I used to have terrible back pain and now none Four things I did not sure which one worked the most but probably a combination of all 4 I had this problem The pain was always worse when I first stepped on it in the morning I went to the Dr and they said I had plantar fasciitis Its inflammation of the heal Mine got so painful I could barely walk I got a night splint at CVS and wore it every night and whenever I was sitting I also took Ibuprofen and put ice on the heal I found that filling a soda bottle just over 23 of the way with water and freezing it then rolling my foot on the frozen bottle helped with the pain and swelling There are also stretches you can do to stretch your foot it helps to do it several times a day If this doesnt help you will need to see your doctor I did finally end up getting a cortisone shot in one of my feet Of course going to the doctor isnt a bad idea to begin with Good luck Sounds like a cracked or broken rib you should go see a doctor My husband had exact same symptoms when he broke his Doctor taped his ribs with some kind of medical tape and gave him some pain meds took a while to heal Hope you feel better soon I recently had mine removed I had dull to severe pain depending on what I ate between my lower shoulder blades Sometimes I would have Attacks that would feel almost like a heart attack they start off by being uncomfortable and gradually get worse until you feel like you cant breathe My attacks ended up making be vomit They got worse every time but sometimes it would be three or four months in between each If I stayed away from greasy high fat foods I would be fine but as soon as I had something I shouldnt I suffered Hope this helps Yes you can

found this piece of information it could help just for reference This is any fluid that leaks or seeps out of the nipple in a woman who is not pregnant or breastfeeding Nipple discharge may be clear white yellow green rusty or bloody Although nipple discharge is not necessarily abnormal it should be evaluated by a health care provider Nipple discharge is rarely a sign of breast cancer Least worrisome is milky or colored but not bloody discharge that occurs when the nipple is squeezed such as during self breast examination Most worrisome is bloody discharge that occurs on its own spontaneous Your provider may test the discharge for blood and cytology abnormal cells and may order an ultrasound and mammogram There are many benign not cancer causes of nipple discharge such as medications breast infection pregnancy imbalance of the hormone prolactin and excessive breast stimulation Take care to avoid nipple stimulation including frequent checks for discharge because stimulation actually makes the discharge persist This is from httpswwwdeltamedixcombreastcaredeltamedixbreastcarecommonproblemsphp Nipple discharge accompanies some benign breast conditions Since the breast is a gland secretions from the nipple of a mature woman are not unusual nor even necessarily a sign of disease For example small amounts of discharge commonly occur in women taking birth control pills or certain other medications including sedatives and tranquilizers If the discharge is being caused by a disease the disease is more likely to be benign than cancerous Nipple discharges come in a variety of colors and textures A milky discharge can be traced to many causes including thyroid malfunction and oral contraceptives or other drugs Women with generalized breast lumpiness may have a sticky discharge that is brown or green The doctor will take a sample of the discharge and send it to a laboratory to be analyzed Benign sticky discharges are treated chiefly by keeping the nipple clean A discharge caused by infection may require antibiotics One of the most common sources of a bloody or sticky discharge is an intraductal papilloma a small wartlike growth that projects into breast ducts near the nipple Any slight bump or bruise in the area of the nipple can cause the papilloma to bleed Single solitary intraductal papillomas usually affect women nearing menopause If the discharge becomes bothersome the diseased duct can be removed surgically without damaging the appearance of the breast Multiple intraductal papillomas in contrast are more common in younger women They often occur in both breasts and are more likely to be associated with a lump than with nipple discharge Multiple intraductal papillomas or any papillomas associated with a lump need to be removed

explanations for excessive blood in the uterus 1 HematometraThis is a collection of blood or unexpelled menstrual blood trapped inside the uterus I have seen this condition where the cervical canal has scarred over eg from a laser or LEEP procedure such that the blood can not pass out into the vagina I have also seen it after an abortion where the cervix is temporarily swollen shut so blood is retained Lastly some congenital abnormal structures of the uterus can prevent flow from escaping This later cause is usually found only in young teen women Retained blood in the uterus can prompt abdominal pain and an enlarged tender uterus 2 A toothick excessive uterine liningIn this scenario it is not blood rather an excessively thick lining inside the uterus This is way more common than a hematometra The usual cause of a too thick lining is missed ovulations The concern with a thickened lining is the development of abnormal precancerous cells This would not cause abdominal pain You mentioned having had removal of your right ovary last month It is unlikely for blood related to your surgery to be trapped inside the uterus It would be possible that you could have missed several ovulations due to the stress of the surgery and any right ovary problems The consultation with the GYN should give you the most for sure answer They can clarify what exactly was seen on ultrasoundblood in the uterus or an excessively thick lining Bottom line both are readily treatable Yours Jane Thats Jane Harrison Hoher RNRNP here on WebMD Do hope this helps you Good Luck Hi Try

would have much of a sex life Hope this helps you Good Luck Hi Sounds like a Sebaceous Cyst found you this info its from a forum by a nurse It sounds as though some of you have abcessesnot sebaceous cysts An abcess abscess starts out small red and hard It may have little to no discomfort but after a while it may get larger harder and more painful When you squeeze and mess around with it youre spreading staph bacteria around and youre only inflaming it more DONT DO THAT As soon as you see an abcess abscess either apply witch hazel or try a sulfurbased drawing salve KEEP THE AREA CLEAN No matter how clean you are staph bacteria resides on your skin Try keeping it as clean as possible with soap and water and dry thoroughly If you intend on using witch hazel or drawing salve put some on a sterile pad first aid pad and put it on the area By doing this youre not only putting the ointment on but youre keeping the area clean Change it when you use the restroom but be sure to follow the instructions on the drawing salve Most say 12 times per day The drawing salve actually breaks down the skin over the abcess abscess until it eventually ruptures on its own Yes its gross Light yellowbeige looking pus may ooze out with a combination of blood as well DO NOT TOUCH IT WITH YOUR HAND Use a clean sterile pad to blot it and place the pad over top of it to keep any outside bacteria from entering and spreading through your system Wash your hands with antibacterial soap thoroughly before and after each bandage change Keep the area clean I cannot emphasize this enough DO NOT try to squeeze it or get any more pus out of it  leave it alone If you dont leave it alone you may find yourself heading to the doctors to have HIM lance it and you dont want that Lidocaine is injected around the area and then the abcess abscess is lanced You think thats bad The doctor then goes in with special forceps and breaks apart the bacterial abcess abscess  this is painful as the lidocaine cannot numb this area The doctor will probably pack it with sterile water dressing and cover it He will prescribe you with antibiotics and you would have to come back three days later for a dressing change SO DO NOT POP IT DO NOT SQUEEZE IT LET IT DRAIN ON ITS OWN by following the directions above I am not a medical doctor but I do have medical training So Hope this helps you Good Luck Hi How

mastalgia or breast pain are not very well understood and the treatments are not well defined either When suffering from mastalgia start by going for a full breast check up which should include an examination by your doctor possibly followed by an ultrasound or mammogram to detect any hidden problems If there is no lump felt on breast exam or mass seen on mammogram then the pain can be treated nonsurgically If there is a cyst seen on ultrasound in the area of pain or tenderness the cyst fluid may be aspirated with a needle in the surgeons office So from what you have said you have done all of the above with no results Breast pain can be cyclic or noncyclic Cyclic mastalgia is breast pain that has a clear relationship to the menstrual cycle and may indicate a hormonal imbalance Mastalgia is often experienced as an early sign of menopause for women in their 40s Breasts are made of glandular tissue which swells with the accumulation of fluid when influenced by hormones During pregnancy this results in the manufacturing of milk During other states of hormonal flux the result is pain So in all your tests have you had a blood test for your hormones Caffeine coffee teas and chocolate causes increased swelling of breast tissue as does a diet high in salt There is evidence that fatty foods and diary products can contribute to breast pain The most common medications to blame are birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy and occasionally antidepressants and others Stress is a major contributor to mastalgia due to the link between hormone secretion and our emotions Treatments include the use of topical applications natural supplements or medication in more resistant cases Reduce or avoid foods that worsen pain while adding Vitamin E and evening primrose oil Exercise and stress reduction may help Topical applications of iodine or antiinflammatory creams may be effective Do hope something here helps you Good Luck Hi Is this just from one position or from

testing in clinical practice Thus \t\t\tmany urologists and STD doctors are unable to identify Chlamydia as \t\t\ta causative pathogen As a result they often make general \t\t\tdiagnosis such as nonspecific urethritis prostatitis andor \t\t\tpelvic inflammatory disease PID etc And they frequently \t\t\tprescribe a variety of ineffective broadspectrum antibiotics making \t\t\tthe patients condition more complicated weakening the immune \t\t\tsystem causing antibiotic resistance failing to address causative \t\t\tpathogens and allowing the infection to spread etc Do hope this helps Good

its a lot better than I could write Brown Discharge between periods is one of common concerns of girls and women Not all cases of brown vaginal discharge are cause for concern Brown vaginal discharge between periods is most often associated with old endometrial tissues Once you start puberty a white andor clear discharge is normal The vagina is selfcleaning This same discharge increases the closer you get to ovulation and when you are sexually aroused You can have this normal discharge for weeks months or even years before getting your first period It will also continue after you get your period Sometimes you can have few times brown discharge before your first period Your first period can look like this also If your period is late you might get a brown rather than red discharge It could also mean that for whatever reason during your last menses the entire uterine lining failed to make a timely exit Brown Discharge may happen right after periods and is just cleaning out your vagina Old blood looks brown This may occur when you are ovulating in the middle of menstrual cycle Brown vaginal discharge between periods can also be a symptom of a medical concern that is much more sinister than leftover endometrial cells Some of these conditions include Pelvic Inflammatory Disease PID menopause sexually transmitted diseases gonorrhea chlamydia or genital warts or cervical cancer Brown vaginal discharge between periods could be a result of dysfunctional endometrial elimination hormonal dysfunctions Each of the other conditions mentioned have much more noticeable symptoms of their own in addition to brown discharge Some of typical additional to brown discharge symptoms are pain discharge that is watery or yellowish depression vaginal dryness pain during intercourse frequent urination infertility dysfunctional uterine bleeding burning itching rash hot to touch mouth ulcers and loss of appetite If the cause of the brown vaginal discharge between periods is simply old uterine cells then the treatment may be simple life style suggestions such as better nutrition regular exercise and drinking more water If you discover that the brown discharge is a result of another condition better visit your doctor Just hope this has help you Good Luck Hi See Above Answer Hi Give this link a good read it may be able to help you out of your problem or has

you if not get to your doctor Good Luck well like i said ive been too busy at the job so havent masturbated in over a month I noticed it when the morning wood started turning into morning rubber  Discharge could be a number of things Youll never know for sure until you get tested Id recommend you go see a doctor just to be on the safe side Try searching for a free clinic in your area Any doctor would first and foremost advise you to rest and take things easy for a while Pinched nerves can be recovered from within a few days or weeks However depending on the severity of the pinched nerve a brace andor surgery would be required Like always go see your doctor and heshe will know whats best Best wishes  The boot being too small could have created a callus on your toe killing the skin there which would discolor it and numb it If so dont worry about it Go see a dermatologist as soon as possible I would agree make the appointment to see your doctor ASAP Thats the best thing to do One possible explanation could be achilles tendinitis I had achilles tendinitis when I was younger and I would feel the pain whenever I would play sports or be active I know you said the pain is persistent but if youre a very active person or have a job that requires you walking around a lot achilles tendinitis is a possible answer Regardless if you want the best advice see you doctor Depends on cause Is it sciatica or neurapathy Is it bone pain or joint pain Look to his diet Increase his fiber and avoid all antihistamines It could be a number of things but it sounds most like it might be a bulging disc I would start by going to you doctor or to a physical therapist In some cases you can get steriod shots to relieve the pain but thats dangerous because you could risk further damage too I would check with your doctor before doing any other kind of strenuous labor like moving heavy items lifting furniture carrying heavy packages etc I would check with your doctor to see if it might be a bulging disc in her back which can be extremely painful and would require surgery If its usually brough on by stress though it might just be tension that is building up I would try to buy her a massage gift certificate at a spa I used to have a lot of lower back pain brought on from stress and running but now I try to get a massage about once a month to reduce tension in my back that builds up Hope this helps its definitley discouraging if doctors dont believe your pain is real If you are eating too quickly and taking too large of bites without chewing thoroughly enough the pain could actually be hapening in your throat when you are swallowing Especially with raw carrots since they are so hard it could definitly hurt while swallowing if you dont chew thoroughly enough I have had this problem for years Sometimes the pain is worse below ball of foot I have found that I can place a tennis ball on floor and take my foot and roll ball around I seems to help Our bodys natural response to pain is to transform fat to sugar for energy to use to flee from the cause of pain or fight the cause of the pain Diabetics have impaired ability to utilize or regulate sugar so the blood sugar rises this also happens with stress or illness  In my personal experience Yes I tapered down dosage from twice to once a day for two weeks Then only once a day every other day for two weeks Finally once a day every three days for one week Because I have to go off and back on the medication every six months this is the only way that prevents that tingly sensation if I just stop completely Go see a physical therapist its what they go to school for If I were you Id get my ear examined by an ENT specialist I had a problem in my ear in the past and visited a general physician who cleaned my ear  gave me some antibiotics advised me to visit an ENT specialist if the problem persists The problem persisted and I visited ENT specialist and was treated for the problem which was cured in 4 weeks Do not massage the leg massaging the leg can move the blood clot allowing the potential to move to heart lung or brain I suggest calling the doctor but I would take pain med like Tylenol I dont know what type of medicine shes on do aspirin may interfere with it so Tylenol would be safer the pain is from lack of circulation I want to say warm soak in tub to open up vessels Call the physician and ask No it is by prescription only go see a doctor It could be I know it was for me My first pregnancy early I developed horrible horrible pain in my lower back which can be mistaken for sciatica but Im pretty sure it was my SI Joint With my second one week after conception pre pregnancy test I started feeling my back in that spot I told my husband I was pregnant and he didnt believe me but sure enough LOL BTW icing my back helped Several problems can cause pain in the area of the ovary If the pain started after your surgery then you may have developed scar tissue that can cause a pulling sensation or sharp pains with movement bowel movements or intercourse If the pain was there prior to having surgery it is likely it was never due to the ovary to begin with Pain in this area can be caused by endometriosis trigger points sensitive areas in the soft tissues like muscle joint hip disease bladder disorders colon disorders and many others Pain can also be referred from other areas so it feels like it is the ovarian area but it is actually originating from somewhere else You should discuss this pain with your doctor The pain in the belly button may just take some time to improve but you may also have a hernia Again I would recommend that you see your doctor for an exam Not an expert just saying maybe lay flat on your back with your knees up a bit propped on a couple pillows or something to relieve some of the pressure off your lower back until you can get help Im not quite sure because I started to mix my word  numbers Im on strong pain killers daily and now on Norspan patches as wellstarted last May on 5 mrg and the dosage has been steadly increasingtoday the doc put me on 25mrgI dont see any difference with my writng but I noticed that when overly stressed everything increasespain fog jumbling letters and numbersso its the stress or the pain killersI wish I knew the right answer good luck knotted muscle pulled muscle have her checked for appendicitis You could have a fibroid Or you could be pregnant and in the process of miscarrying I am not a doctor just have had friends that these were the dianoses when they experienced the same thing Could be many reasons Lack or insifficient lubrication which can be corrected with increased foreplay or an artificial lubricant It could also be the size of your partner which again is corrected by increased foreplay lubrication and taking it slowthe ambience is a major factor if its the size because you need to be relaxed and you will stretch Then there is always the possiblity that you have a medical issue and need to have that ruled out by your gynecologist But I would try romancing first being that this is not life threatening U truly need to have a work up done on ur heart Nothing to play with and it does sound more serious than just take a pill and chill im no medical doctor or anything but it sounds like it could have something to do with a nerve if you have a sinus infection youre gonna need antibiotics unless its a fungal sinus infection then you will need an anti fungal medication but it could also be sinusitis in that case its inflammation from allergies or a viral infection you should go see a doctor about it if he thinks you have a sinus infection hes gonna give you the antibiotics or anti fungal prescription but if its just sinusitis he will probably give you an antihistamine or possibly antiviral medication depending on what kind of sinusitis it is the worst case scenario is probably fungal I am not a doctor i just picked up a little bit of information about this so do not hang on what i tell you see a professional change your diet start eating more fiber 24 grams per day sunflower seeds are great for fiber and you dont want to eat too much of one thing then you get an inconsistent stool that might also account for your nails the tooth decay is just you need to brush your teeth more often go see a dentist and get your teeth fixed and then start brushing them and keeping them clean the jaw popping could be related to the underbite youre gonna want to get braces maybe if youre losing your hair that may not be a big deal if it comes out in the brush thats normal if its like you go to wash your hair and it starts falling out like on the grudge you may wanna get checked out Yes several years ago I was told I had a Ulcer I do not have insurance so I can not go see a doctor Thank tou for the replies I got my MRI finding two buldging disk in my lower back forgot which ones lol and severe artritist in my hip and problems in my SI join They RX hydrocodone 5325x2 daily and flexeril x3 a day which made me too tired so they took me off I had the lumbar steroid injection which left me in more pain than before But Im going to give it one more try because I rather try anything to have my life back Instead of seeing the actual doctor Ive been seeing the Nurse practitioner and she had been amazing and Ive been building a relationship with her which is great She has also changed my meds to hydrocodone 75325x3 a day and robaxin x3 d day So far this combo is slightly helping but I still am having trouble sleeping at night it seems like thats when I hurt the worse She said on my next appt we will try a anti anxiety med to help me sleep Thanks again for your replies nice to know Im not the only one out there God bless Hi thats not nice kinda in the same situation as u Ive read the symptoms of your questions and it seem rather the same to gal stones Yes your pain could be cardiac it also could be ulcer related among other things You really need to have this evaluated especially to rule out a cardiac event Good luck and God bless  Whenever anyone gets a pain in their heart its always a good idea to immediately check with your doctor We can never assume this is either anxiety or panic until we have ruled out that it might be a medical problem True it might be panic or anxiety but please have it checked out See a rheumatologist for an arthritis evaluation I myself can not help you but I to have had femur repair and my pain is very excruciating unbearable pain No one has dx this and I read your in the very same condition as I Some doctors just said it will go away I would like to know how youfound the hole in the muscle mri cat scan please help me May God Bless you and I prAY FOR YOUR COMPLETE HEALING DID THEY SAY IT WILL MEND ON ITS OWN tHANK YOU pATRICIA aNN Hello snick1899 First you should get evaluated for possible serious injury or pathology You need also to rule out a spinal disc bulge or herniation at the level and region of your symptoms This is possibly a musculoskeletal straining injury that has not been allowed to heal sufficiently If you dont get this professionally treated try an overthecounter antiinflammatory medication regimen for about 5 days following instructions and warnings carefully on the product Longer use of pain relievers warrants a physician evaluation Just as important is limiting physical activity for a couple of weeks to give sensitive strained chestwall muscles ligaments and cartilage a chance to fully heal also the possible thoracic spinal disc injury You probably keep aggravating the healing process undermining your return to good health I currently am dealing with pain and spasms similar to what you describe and while it is very difficult to avoid activities I am determined as you might do to properly rest take OTC antiinflammatory medication and recover fully Best of luck and selfrestraint you may have bone spurs go to a doctor to have it looked at it may need to be removed I am having the same problemMy Stomach is so tender and soreI have excruciating pain I have had a lot of test and all the Doctors said was Gastritis and Colitis I am not taking any medication for this and just wondering what I should do I cant live in this kind of painThere should be some kind of cure for this I dont have Diarrhea or sick stomach Depends on how much has consumed Remember Lettuce is mostly water and roughage Consider also where the Lettuce came from  as if a salad bar  there may be bacteria such as ecoli or salmonella Best to have a stool culture taken if this continues beyond two days People just simply refuse to wash their hands  and contamination spreads Also depending on sprays  if it was washed before it was consumed Protein fats and starches are first all related  simply depends on the breakdown First thought to me would be gallbladder  but the location of the pain pins things down a bit more Now I know space here is limited  but again one needs information How much of these proteins fats and starches are you eating and in what forms Pizza Pork Chops all with pasta and bread Everyone needs these 3 items within their diet  but if any are overdone  BAM All take time to digest within the stomach breaking down into smaller more tolerable items before the hit the gut  the small intestine duodenum jejunum ileum  there is a lot of activity that goes on here So from what information you have here  my first suggestion is see your MD Other than that  Id suspect a esophageal spasm due to gastritis of the stomach or a night of heavy alcohol use The other thing to consider is a hernia of the diaphragm between the lungs and belly called an Hiatal Hernia Diagnosed by a barium swallow at your local hospital XRay department  piece of cake Get er done 1 When we were able to it was about once a month Now its to painful to even try 2 Yes 3We are not using sex oils its more like spit 4 No I have also been tested for every STD every test was negative He was also tested he got negatives as well No No No Anxiety is a terrible thing It can make you feel like you are going to go off the deep end There are meds out there that a not addiction and that will most likely help you If you have had it this long maybe it is time to start taking something Research the meds out there and go see your doctor to let him help you Dont lose anymore days of your life to this and good luck could be your ovaries you should go get an xray or whatever your doctor orders just to be safe yes liver Unfortunately the only way to know for sure that its IBS and not something else is to see a doctor and there is still no guarantee that they can tell you with 100 certainty What they can do is make sure it isnt something more serious Yesdefinitely get checked out right away I did the same thing a while back fell exactly on my tailbone hurt like heck took a few days for the bruise to come all the way in and was incredibly sore and sensitive for a few weeks maybe a month before really back to normal and I couldnt do any floor exercises for about two weeks either and mine was only bruised not broken My little girl was colicky as well and nothing helped but soy formula Its not harmful at all yo your child Your baby may have a sensitivity to milk based formulas Colicky babies seem to do better on soy because its seems to soothe there Stomachs and possibly a premature digestive system can cause flare ups of colic Have you ever got a second opinion Had bad stomach and Back pain at the same time with a loose stool with blood in it but the stomach and back pain was severe not hurting right now though First of all are you flatfooted If so you may want to consider getting orthopedic inserts for your feet If not you may just need to change the type of shoe or boot youre wearing Another thing to try is to lay flat on a hard surface for at least 2 hrs this will allow your lower back to relax and should alleviate some of the pain You might also consider changing the type of mattress you use I have had the same symptoms It could just be a pinched nerve or disc damage To find out for sure youll need to see an Orthopedist Neurosurgeon or Neurologist and get an MRI I had surgery for mine and was pain free the next day Please see a upper GI specialist Like yourself my stomach was in so much pain with eating and drinking and anything over the counter would not work I had out patient procedure today by the upper GI and the ulcers were confirmed I am now being properly treated and am on my way to feeling better Rai Starr on FB or raistarr1 on Skype Feel better soon Blessings HI I am eight weeks postop and still have pain and swelling albeit much less then it was a couple of weeks ago I do exercises every day I

would have to ask Is it going down Are you yelling timber Was that a night you dont rambler was the one you dont forget DRINK LOTION YOU WILL BE BACK TO THE OPERA HOUSE IN NO TIME BABI If you have had unprotected sex before your symptoms started its possible you may have a STD One possibility to be explored with an MD would be a chronic irritation of the valve which regulates food and water transmission into the stomach I would suggest that you be evaluated by a GP or a Gastroenterologist before deciding that medication such as Prilosec is an appropriate way to address this problem Note though technically trained and a long time advocate for chronic face pain patients I am not a physician You need to see somebody who is Red Lawhern PhD That might depend on the nature of the vision problems you are concerned with and the medications you are taking for them Some cases of pain in the trigeminal distribution can be caused by discrete benign tumor AVM aneurism MS plaques or other structural anomalies close to the trigeminal nerve Youll need high resolution imagery of the brain to resolve root causes for this sort of thing I write as a nonphysician patient advocate for chronic

to offer Regards Red Lawhern PhD Moderator Living With TN Endocet is Oxycodone and Tylenol Acetaminophen There are other and more powerful pain medications But you will want to be advised by your physician on which are most appropriate for the medical conditions which are causing your pain There is no one size fits all answer to a question like yours Im afraid I write as a technically trained medical layman who advocates for chronic facial pain patients many of whom use opioids However I am not a physician Regards Red Lawhern PhD Does not hurt in back only front around groin area It could be a pinched nerve or God forbid an aneurysm PLEASE see your doctor or go to the emergency room immediately This is NOT something you want to take any chances with You are the best advocate for your health take advantage of that and take care of any problems that come up with your health  and take any preventative measures to make sure you stay healthy Youll need to take a break and rest your elbow Depending on if the numbness is constant or not and how long this has been going on you really need to see your doctor to make sure nothing serious is going on Good luck Pain typically radiates in between shoulder blades Where is the initial pain Are you male or female That is pertinent to answering this question Also where is the pain Also contrary to popular belief avoid dairy products Although milk may coat your stomach it makes your stomach produce more acid to break down the enzymes in it If yours has been only for about a month lucky you Ive had mine for almost 4 mos and nothing is helping I dont eat spicy food drink alcohol or do dairy and still cant figure out what to eat It also depends on what kind of ulcer you have If its from bacteria try asking for antibiotics They can do blood tests to find out I was instructed by my Endocrinologist that if my blood sugar level tested 300 or higher twice in a row I was to go to the emergency room immediately following the second high reading You need to do the same I had neuropathy pain in my left foot but I never took medication for it My A1cs had been 5360 for several years but the pain was still there In 2007 I started using an insulin pump My adjustments on my pump enabled me to be in the range 70130 almost 90 of the time That improvement resulted in greatly reducing my pain I have an occasional twinge of the neuropathy pain but it rarely bothers me now Many diabetics can reverse their neuropathy by improving their control Many many things can cause chest pain although we worry about the heart being a cause of it typically first as heart disease can carry some serious consequences At age 17 the risk of artery blockages leading to chest pain would be very unusual except in some cases of congenital coronary abnormalities It is important that you have a complete history and phsyical exam by a physician to help look for causes of this persistent pain They will ask questions about your activity level for example can you and do you exercise regularly without difficulities and carefully exam your heart lungs and blood vessels You deserve to get an answer for something like persistent pain and at age 17 its a good time to be reminded of hearthealthy living with things like eating healthy exercising regularly avoiding tobacco products etc Any chest pain that occurs in someone that has known coronary disease as you do with the three stents should be evaluated by a physician especially if the symptoms are consistent with those occurring before the stents were placed Other concerning symptoms are chest pains or discomfort that occur with exertion or stress While there are many causes of chest discomfort please take seriously these symptoms given the past history and talk with your doctor There are many normal aches and pains of pregnancy Many women suffer from restless leg syndrome during the night and have many leg cramps Another problem that women suffer from is sciatica pain This pain is typically noted to start in the buttock and go down the back of the leg This at times can be very uncomfortable This is related compression of the nerve supply from the enlarged uterus The other problem that can occur is related to lumbar disc problems which can be more severe and cause possible significant problems As always you should consult with your physician and make him aware of your concerns There are a number of women who experience this as the uterus grows Usually women describe it as sharp stabbing pain in the vaginal area This may be related to the uterus growing and stretching If you have vaginal bleeding you should contact your physician The other question is whether you have had an ultrasound to confirm the pregnancy is in the uterus If you have not you should definitely contact your physician to make sure you are all right This should be a normal finding The real question is what type of back pain are you having Is it constant or intermittent If it comes and goes you may be having contractions and should contact your physician If it is constant then it most likely is related to nerve impingement related to the pregnancy Exercise is a very good idea You may want to take a warm bath keeping the water temperature less than 104 degrees preferably around 100 This may be relieving Depending on what the pain is your physician can possibly provide you with ideas on how to better handle the problem There are different exercises alternative type of therapies and there are safe medications that can be used to help as well Yes Melatonin helps calm the nerves and muscles in ones body and also allows a good night sleep No the eardrums DO NOT MOVE OUT OF PLACE They are fixed in position and stay right there They can however retract be sucked in or bulge depending on the middle ear pressure but they sure do not move out of place Assuming you did not strain or injure your arm I feel that it is related soley to your flu shot I think it important to address this issue with your doctor Sometimes the needle used for the injection can cause a hematoma  a pocket of blood at the injection site This can cause an sterile abscess or even an abscess that is secondarily infected Get it checked out The vaccine itself is not likely the issue but rather the injection Hidden under our opaque skin and subcutaneous tissue are nerves The nurse may have given you the shot in a wrong location or used a needle a bit too long or it may have been a fluke  hitting a nerve that shouldnt be there You will need to see your medical provider and perhaps see a neurologist Many times these postinjection neuropathies will selfresolve but you need to be examined Your inability to lift your arm is not something that can be ignored I dont believe that any of the overthecounter pain medications have SULFA Check with the pharmacist just in case when you purchase them but I think you are good to go It would be nice to know the CAUSE of the eye pain before addressing ways of dealing with it See an eye specialist first As you know you cannot be diagnosed blindly over the Internet You need to see a good orthopedist find one who has an expertise in shoulders and yes you probably will need an MRI See a pulmonary lung specialist or allergist I have never seen ibuprofen cause nighttime wheezing like you have described Although it is possible I think it would be unlikey as the sole cause Sounds like it is time for you to see your medical provider so that you can have your throat and ears properly examined If you have an infection that is causing the pain your medical provider can help Painful urination with blood especially in someone who is diabetic is a urinary tract infection until otherwise proven Yes you need to see a medical provider but not necessarily the ER this is not an emergency a regular medical office or urgent care facility would be fine and less expensive In the meantime drink plenty of water As much as I would like to help you no one can be blindly examined and diagnosed over the Internet You have had this problem for 6 months At what point to you think it would be a good idea to seek proper medical care There can be hundreds of reasons to account for your symptoms and it is your responsibility  as trustee of your body  to take care of it The only way that you can get to the bottom of these symptoms is to SEE a good medical provider  one who can take a thorough medical history perhaps run a few diagnostic tests Unfortunately without the ability to examine your foot I would have no idea if you will be able to play in your tournament a few days from now Medical providers do not like making blind decisions like this so you will need to be examined A tetanus vaccine prevents tetanus but does not prevent INFECTION Deeper wounds like you have described could become infected if not cared for properly Orchitis would be higher on the list than a testicular cancer but both need to be considered You need a testicular ultrasound Doppler as soon as you can get it and of course a visit to a urologist Testicular cancer does not really act like this It is not very helpful to worry unnecessarily about these things until you get a diagnosis I am sorry that I cannot be more specific but making these blind guesses is not something that medical professionals are fond of doing We like to see these problems firsthand look at the imaging studies and THEN and only then make a presumptive diagnosis Hang in there my friend no pun intended Please dont try and post the pictures Pictures may be worth a thousand words but if the picture of genitalia those words may not be appropriate The penis is covered by skin and the skin is capable of all kinds of skin conditions including pimples tiny sebaceous oil gland cysts folliculitis hair follicules heat rashes eczema etc Many of these little bumps are completely innocent You cannot accurately diagnose ANY skin condition based solely on a description so it is off ot your primary care or better yet a urologist  someone who specializes in the this part of the anatomy Rather than stress out over selfdiagnoses it would be best to have an answer from a medical specialist  one who can see these bumps firsthand If I cant SEE itfeel this lesion firsthandI cant identify it This is why you need to have a proper medical evaluation Take nothing  unless you specifically get the okay from the surgeon AND the anesthesiologist otherwise your surgery could be abruptly cancelled That is really up to you I dont have enough information about the type of pain severity location duration of the pain your age etc to really make that decision for you The only way you can get this problem properly evaluated to SEE your medical provider I see no point in waiting at all Adderall is a powerful stimulant  the same as methamphetaminesspeed  and can mostdefinitely cause anxiety reaction and agitation It does not typically cause back pain etc so other sources need to be medicallyinvestigated Your doctor may need to try you on a different medication for your ADD or whatever reason you are taking the Adderall httpwwwwebmdcomdrugsdrug63163AdderallOralaspx You may have chronic balanitis perhaps due to yeast Make an appointment with a good urologist so you can get to the bottom of this six year old problem You cannot be blindly diagnosed over the Internet based solely on your brief postingyou need to be examined If the test was not Strep then it was most likely viral One virus in particular tends to last longer than the typical weekthat is the EBV virus the virus that causes mononucleosis As you know I have no way of examining your throat over the Internet but I would strongly suggest that you have your medical provider order an EBV panel a mono test I have no idea how long your throat will be sore since healing and recovery is very individual If you do have mono it could be weeks before you are feeling better Insurance or not making an accurate diagnosis is required BEFORE a treatment plan is determined I know this injury is untimely but these things happen If your car broke down your car insurance wouldnt fix ityou would have to come up with the money to do it The same deal goes with your husband Borrow moneycharge the visit to a credit cardhave the facility bill you and pay latereither way the evaluation needs to be done FIRST There is absolutely no way for me or any medical professional to be able to tell you the reason for his side pain since we dont even know which side or the location on that side Without knowing his medical history I couldnt even recommend ibuprofen Get him the care he needsworry about paying for it later An urgent care facility is a fraction of the cost of an ER so this is what I suggest Most even have their own xrays I would be reluctant to use medical marijuana on an elderly person who may have problems with memory and mental processing as it is However a pain managment specialist may have different ideas This 95 year old should really see a pain specialist so that hisher pain can be pharmaceutically managed taking into account ALL of there medical history Personally I have never prescribed it for these reasons Yes your finger could be broken IF the xrays did not clearly show your finger The palm of your hand is a different area called the metacarpals so make sure the xray viewed this area as well or you may need another film Sprains do not show up on xraysjust bones Since I cant examine you you may need to see a medical provider again if the treatment is not helping Yesyou need a medical evaluation You may have had trauma to your kidney or bladder Save money some other ways but do avoid seeking a proper medical evaluationj for abdominal discomfort and hematuria Let him do it Sometimes bad experiences help The answer is No If you try and burn a nerve there is a very good chance that the pain will be worse A lith is a stone In your case the stone is in the distal end of the appendix This does not mean you will need surgery unless of course you have appendix PAIN appendicitis Cervical neck disc disease will not cause thigh pain but degenerative disc disease in your low back lumbar area could certainly do this If you have not had imaging studies of your low back this should be done The bleeding is the most concerning He will need to call and see his surgeon It is really not normal to be bleeding from one of the laparoscopic sites for this long Since he is also having pulling pains in his groin there could be some internal bleeding going on as well I have plenty of ideashundreds in fact but an idea is not a definitive diagnosis You need to see a medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated You may need some diagnostic tests like a chest xray to rule out pneumonia or asthma Since I do not know anything about you your medical history or have any way of examining you my best advice is for you to be carefully examined You need to find out what this something really is so you need to see your medical provider or a proctologist for a proper examination It could be an internal hemorrhoid but this would need to be confirmed I could also be a rectal prolapse part of your rectum coming out and going back in Incidentally hemorrhoid creams do not cure hemorrhoids they just reduce some inflammationthey are still there You are having pain and you are getting worse according to your posting At what point to you seek medical care My advice would be for you to make an appointment The most common cause of sore throat is a virus and most will last about a week unless of course you are developing a particularly nasty viral infection called mononucleosis mono If your sore throat does not resolve in a week your doctor should consider ordering a mono test EBV panel Hopefully you had a culture done takes 23 days since rapid Strep tests are not 100 accurate As far as what to do about your extreme pain I am at a loss since I really have no way of seeing your throat or review your medical history Gargling with warm saline 14 tsp of table salt with 8 oz of warm water can help Ibuprofen can help Again it is not typical to have extreme pain with a simple viral sore throat so you may need to be reexamined I dont know I do not know anything about your daughter not even her age and more importantlyI have no way of examining her over the Internet take a detailed medical history or run any diagnostic tests You will need to have your daughter examined by a medical professional You may have the answer Abdominal discomfort and inability to have a bowel movement in a five year old is typically constipation the pain may be caused by gas or even stoolholding a condition where the child does not want to defecate and tries to hold it If the continues to have pain and is not defecating he will need to be properly examined If constipation has been a longterm issue he will need to see his medical provider anyway or some specific dietary intervention or perhaps the addition of a stool softener in his diet Most minor cases of pectus excavatum do not need surgery and that may include you The fact that your teammates outrun you may have little to do with the pectus If you do have surgery there are several different procedures and the recovery time will vary You cant have surgery just because you want it It would only be done if the surgeon determines you need it No that would not be considered normal People who use catheters are very prone to urinary tract infections so it would be wise for your father to get this urinary pain properly evaluated by his medical provider As you know health experts on this site have absolutely no way of looking at your eye across the Internet so you are getting a blind guess A red painful eye could be conjunctivitis pink eye assuming you did not have any traumainjury to the eye Viruses and bacteria are the main culprits and treatment is usually with prescription antibiotic eye drops A small yellow lump on your sclera as you call it may be a harmless pterigium I hope I spelled that correctly Look up this common eye disorder on the Internet or on WebMD to see if you can find a picture There are two possibilitiesfirst you may have completely packed your waxfilled ear against the eardrum In this case your eardrum cannot move and thus your hearing would be diminished Second you may have ruptured your eardrum or at the very least caused trauma to the eardrum even if you did not see any blood For a wax impaction a warm water lavage would likely remove the packed wax however if the integrity of your eardrum has been disrupted requires an otoscopic exam by a medical professional washing out your ear would be contraindicatedan ENT or a trained professional would need to carefully remove the wax impaction Stop using Qtips They are dangerous and earwax is NOT dirtit is a beneficial protective coating for the ear canal The medical provider is quite skilled at smelling tobacco on your breath but there will not likely be any telltale signs of your smoking from just looking at your tonsils You are more prone to tonsillitis and other upper respiratory infections BECAUSE you are a smoker Dont be a fool my young friend When you start smoking young you are more likely to start having serious consequences at a younger age so dont be surprised in the future when a doctor tells you that you have cancer or some type of other serious cigaretterelated illness STOP NOWnot because it is illegal but because only stupid people and people who do not plan on living a long and healthy life smoke Most of these little tears I am assuming it is little will heal rapidlyin just a few days There is really little that you can put on this area but a vaselinebased ointment or just plain vaseline will protect the area from urinary irritation Just keeping the area clean during a shower is usually sufficient and of course avoiding intercourse until you have completely healed There is no thing called average when it comes to a personor a person who has knee surgery Every person on this planet is different when it comes to their ability to deal with pain and not all knee surgeries or the surgeon performing them are the same either So there are no average times for pain duration The ONLY person that could give you a rough estimate would be the surgeon who did the procedure  someone who is familiar with the case and someone who knows what kind of surgery that was done I would have to see his scrotum and examine him to really make a comment so I would suggest that you bring this up to his pediatrician At age five the testicles are small and tend to be migratory can travel up higher in the scrotum rather than hang low like in a man If your doctor was not able to find a reason for your ear pain and hearing changes then you need to see an ENT specialist for a higherlevel examination TMJ and bruxism grinding the teeth doesnt cause hearing loss but it can cause ear pain Many dentists now specialize in TMJ disorders so finding one would be quite helpful in tracking down the reasons Ear pain can be caused by infection or referred pain from other head and neck areas like your throat lymph nodes salivary glands cervical spine tonsils if you have them sinuses and nerve disordersJust because one doctor could not find a cause does not mean a second medical provider like an ENT will have the same conclusion Ibuprofen IS the ingredientthe only ingredient A 200 mg tablet of ibuprofen is available over the counter without a prescription but a 600 mg or 800 mg tablet requires a prescription I cant offer you a definitive answer since I have no way of examining you over the Internet but this could be a small spermatocele  unrelated to your varicocele I would suggest that you see your medical provider so that you can be properly examined and diagnosed If you do have a lump on the testicle itself this will need to be confirmed If the bleeding is coming from those hemorrhoids they may need to be surgically removed The colonoscopy is going to determine if you have internal hemorrhoids polyps or other reasons to account for your bleeding Prednisone will NOT help hemorrhoids in any way Even NSAIDs like aspirin can cause more bleeding so this may not be the best pain medication for you Then it is time for you to see a medical provider so you can have that painful elbow properly examined be diagnosed and treated  not something that can be blindly accomplished over the Internet It has been seven months so dont wait another seven months The Rule of Threes  A child over THREE weeks old and under THREE MONTHs who cries more than THREE HOURS a day mostly in the evening more than THREE DAYS A WEEK Does this fit your granddaughters pattern The may have COLIC If so the good news is that it may miraculously disappear soon after age three Colic remains a mysterious pediatric problem that has plagued sleepdeprived parents for ages As a seasoned parent yourself your kids may not have had it Colicy kids can scream for hours and drive new parents and grandmothers wacky Obviously this is just a blind guess over the Internet but I have seen this zillions of times in my primary care pediatric practice Yes there could be other reasons but since her doctor did not find a reason colic is definitely on the possibility table Do an Internet search on colic Use only medical sites please like WebMD or the American Academy of Pediatrics Making the diagnostic call requires an exam not something that can be accomplished over the Internet I pilonidal cystabscess is a possibility but so are other skin abscesses like sebaceous cysts I would suggest that you see a medical provider and have this painful area properly examined so you can have a definitive diagnosis and treatment plan Having a UTI  especially one that is under appropriate treatment  would not prevent you from using a hot tub However since you are having back pain which may or may not be related to your UTI you should consult your medical provider to make sure you are on the correct antibiotic Hopefully you had a urine culture taken that would answer that question Even though the CT scan was normal if you are continuing to have this troublesome array of symptoms you need to be seen by a neurologist for a higherlevel diagnostic evaluation The only way to know conclusively if you broke your thumb is to have an xray Pain in the flank does not indicate a bladder infection that would bladder pain the bladder is located in middle above your public bone Pain in the right or left flank area could indicate KIDNEY problems musculoskeletal disorders or even gastrointestinal problems Right flank only Gall bladder or liver can be included in the wide array of possibilities Left flank Referred pain from the pancreas or spleen If the CAUSE of your ten month flank pain has yet to be determined I would be very concerned Have you had an abdominal MRI or CT scan Are you seeing a specialist It is very very important for you to have a dicussion with your doctors about the next diagnostic steps that need to be taken Why arent you wearing wrestling head gear that is designed to PROTECT your ears Yes you may have a hematoma  an accumulation of blood in the pinnae outer ear Unless this hematoma is properly drained and managed it may turn into a cauliflower ear  a terrible and preventable cosmetic deformity You need to get this checked out immediately It would be best to see an ENT specialist but any primary care medical provider should be able to help you Take this problem VERY SERIOUSLY my young friend Inform your parents and get that ear properly examined as soon as you can Maybe Lymph nodes enlarge or become tender in response to an infection or inflammation in their immediate drainage neighborhood Since your doctor was not able to find a source for this pain or inflammation it would not be inappropriate to have some basic tests first like a CBC  complete blood count Many things including dental disorders can cause an enlarged lymph node so consider a visit to your dentist as well Get a second opinion from another podiatrist You should always be concerned about chest pain but it would not be likely this would be related to your tetanus shot in any way I dont know anything about you  your age risk factors or anything about your medical history  so if you are concerned enough to post you should be concerned enough to see a medical provider  someone who has the ability to examine you and determine the reason for your chest pain and irritabiltiy This may be normal seminal fluid from the prostate A bowel movement can milk a small amount of this fluid from the prostate gland as it passes Assuming you are not having any penile discharge associated with a sexuallytransmitted infection or have signs of prostatitis prostate infection this should not be an issue Nothe trigeminal nerve does not go down you arm or to your hand The nerve that services this area comes from your neck cervical spine Your doctor needs to prescribe a prescription pain medication shingles is VERY painful Unfortunately I do not know anything about you or your case to suggest a specific medication so is really your doctors obligation to provide you with some help A narcotic medicationfor a week or sois very appropriate To recommend that you only take overthecounter medications for pain control is an underestimation of your pain level There are stronger medications for the itching too Yesit is painful when you urinate You feel the need to urinate again even after you finished You are going to the toilet frequently If the kidneys are involved you may have flankback pain That would be a reasonable course of action Sinusitis can be a bit tricky to treat and often one course of antibiotics may not do it In light of the fact that you are still having facial pain and pressure and are still congested and coughing you may need further care  perhaps a stronger or different antibiotic assuming you had an antibiotic the first round and something more to control your symptoms I dont know your ageor more importantly have any way of seeing your toes and examining you but it may be onychomycosis  a nail fungus See a podiatrist or your primary care medical provider I cant examine you so I have no way of confirming or disputing the diagnosis but there is a sinus mastoid sinus located behind both earsthe bony prominence that you feel The mastoid sinus connects with the middle ear so usually there are earrelated symptoms There are also lymph nodes in this area Right shoulder Yes that is possible Low back No Cervical nerves do not go to the low back area It could be prostatitis or something more serious Your husband needs to see a urologist for a proper and thorough examination Dont let me talk you out of itthis is important No but it can sure destroy your liver Why overuse acetaminophen OopsI mean dont let HIM talk you out of going to the urologist Men can be stubborn about medical care sometimes You need to have your arm by a medical providerand have an xray Symptoms alone are not sufficient to determine if you have a fracture or not Gonorrhea and Chlamydia can be detected by a urine test DNA probe but not a simple urine dipstick test I think you answered your own question An old rule in life if it hurts dont do it If you have found that the redness and odor is directly related to your masturbation ritual then back off a bit You need to see an orthopedist and have an MRI You have given your conservative treatment enough time so you need a higherlevel diagnostic evaluation Not likely A toe injury should not cause the systemic symptoms like you are describing You most likely have something else going on perhaps a viral infection in addition to your injured toe There are no rules in medicine that states that a person can only have one issue at a time or that all symptoms must somehow be connected I cant see your rash but onesided blisters are more likely to be shingles Kidney stones do not cause rashes and the type of pain is extremely deep NO it is normal It is time for you to see a back specialist and get a diagnostic workup perhaps including an MRI There can be many possible causes Back pain isnt just for older people Before talking about a cure or even an effective treatment you need to have a definitive diagnosis  not something that you may be doing accurately I assume you are not a podiatrist and not something that I can blindly determine based solely on your brief posting You need to be examined by an expert so I recommend that you see a podiatrist You may also need an xray of that painful foot In the meantime you may get some relief with antiinflammatory medications assuming you can take this sort of drug and a shoe insert to help relieve the pressure You may have sustained a small corneal abrasion from this incident Corneal abrasions heal quickly but are at risk for a secondary infectionand chickens are not known for their high levels of personal hygiene You can see your optometrist and urgent care facility or your primary care provider Most will have the ability to fluoresceinstain your eye check it for an abrasion but always ask first when you make your appointment This visit should be as soon as possible Having your husband or a trusted female friend would be great Talk to you women friends too Having someone with you will make you feel safer t may not be the exambut the examiner so consider getting a female nurse practitioner or PA or find a very kind and compassionate gynecologist To many unfortunately this intimate exam is so routinealmost like a dentist looking in your mouththat they may not take the time and care to do it gently Again ask your friends for a referral to someone they find to be helpful Your primary care medical provider can give you a shortacting antianxiety medication if you ask Something like Xanax at a lowdose may be helpful Look deep inside yourself to see if there was a stressful event in the past that may be surfacing when you are having a gynecological exam If so a counselor may be able to help you deal with this very specific anxiety There can be many reasons but it would not be possible for me or any medical provider to be able to specifically determine that cause you YOUR testicle pain blindly over the Internet You will need to see your primary care medical provider or a urologist The tibia is a weightbearing bone and it takes quite an impact to break it however a person can have an occult or stress fracture of this bone If this has not improved in a week it would be wise to consider a handson examination and an xray In stress fractures the xray may be negative so your medical provider may need to get a bone scan if you continue to be symptomatic Dont take a drug that expired FIVE YEARS ago I dont knowI have no way of examining you or ordering any diagnostic tests but it could be sciatic nerve compression perhaps due to a bad or degenerative disc You need an MRI and a visit to a back specialist YesAdvil ibuprofen wears off in about six hours and these two drugs are medicallycompatible You need to be medical examined If the ER is your only option than yes use the ER Your hernia can also be examined by your primary care provider or an urgent care facilityconsiderably lessexpensively and perhaps even faster You will eventually need to see a surgeon  really the only definitive way to fix an hernia is to have it surgically repaired Breast feed your baby The chance of you or your baby getting Reye syndrome or having any consequences after one dose for the tiny amount of salicylates aspirin in the Pepto Bismol would be highly highly unlikely What is more important is that YOU stay wellhydrated and nourished until the virus has abated If this is not possible you can temporarily switch the baby to supplemental formulas or any stored breast milk until you are up to the mission again Get better You baby will be fine if you resume breastfeeding This is an example of acoustic injury like a gun shot or explosion A dog bark of course is not usually as loud as those but it can cause pain and ringing In most cases this will resolve in a week or so as the ear heals from this event If not you may need to see an ENT for an examination You may have two different types of ear problems The ear that was prescribed drops assuming these are antibiotic or antibioticsteroid dropsyou didnt say would be for an EXTERNAL ear infection like swimmers ear otitis externa Your other ear that is painful could be due to middle ear pressure or even a middle ear infection in progress The eardrum may not have been red or bulging at the time of this exam but the pressure could still cause pain Since I have no way of making that determination blindly over the Internet you would need to contact that medical provider again  someone that can reexamine your ear Obviously an accurate diagnosis is the key to and effective treatment Yes weight loss would help Heel spurs can be treated by surgery steroid injections and orthotics special shoe inserts I dont have any way of knowing if your vaginal discharge is an STD or not since I cant examine you look at the discharge under a microscope or test it in a lab nor do I know your sexual history or your boyfriends sexual history The only thing you can do if your doctors treatment is not working is to go backbe reexamined and be tested this time by a vaginal culture or smear A person can have a yeast infection AND something else so if you are worried about an STD that something else will need to be specifically tested See your gynecologist There could be a discoverable reason why you are having painful sex so you wont have to use EMLA an anesthetic cream These are vague and nonspecific symptoms Unfortunately it would be impossible to blindly diagnose your friend based on such little information This person should be seen by a medical provider so heshe can be properly examined diagnosed and treated  three things that cannot be accomplished over the Internet Most throat infections or throat pain is caused by viruses Viruses do not respond at all to antibiotics The only way a medical clinician would recommend azithromycin for a throat infection would be for a penicillinallergic person who has labdocumented Strep and does NOT have mononucleosis I do not recommend selfdiagnosis and selftreatment using leftover antibiotics or antibiotics there are prescribed for someone else when it comes to managing a throat infection No A sty would not cause this other pain As you know I have no way of seeing your throat taking a more detailed medical history or examining you over the Internet I can make a blind guess but a guess is NOT the same as a diagnostic opinion  one that can only be accomplished by seeing a medical professional or ENT specialist You may want to look up tonsilliths tonsil stones These are common accumulations of food and other debris that can get trapped in or around the tonsillar areas Again dont diagnose yourselfsee a medical professional for these matters Back exercises and stretching is the best nonsurgical way of dealing with sciatica If you are overweight the extra lbs need to go You can find lots of Internet references for the proper exercises called Williams back exercises or ask a friendly physical therapist for a list Going to the hospital ER is really not the best place to evaluate a twoyear old eye injury with residual symptoms andthere is really nothing over the counter that I could recommend over the Internet since I do not know anything about you your medical history age extenttype of injuryetc You need to SEE an eye specialistan ophthalmologist someone who has the training and ability to conduct a highlevel evaluation Before ANY treatment one must first have a definitive diagnosis Have your gynecologist perform a pelvic exam during this time or order an ultrasound A bimanual examination or the ultrasound may reveal the answer One possibility of many could be an ovarian cyst Keep in mind that not all of your symptoms need to be linked to one universal cause Fatigue sore throat for a month Think mononucleosis Your doctor can order a sensitive EBV panel not the lesssensitive mono spot test Lump in breast in a 17 year old male I assume This is most likely adolescent gynecomastia You can look this up on the Internet This is quite common and related to hormones but it may NOT go away in a few months It can last longer Yes Basically that is plantar fasciitis The medical provider who is treating you for Strep is not really doing it correctly If you do a brief search on treating Strep with azithromycin you will see that the standard Zpack is not sufficient Strep should be treated with two pills 500mg every day for five days twice the dose you have been given The purpose of any antibiotic in the treatment of labdiagnosed Strep I hope you had a confirmation test to prove you did indeed have Strep is to prevent complicationsNOT to treat the associated pain Antibitoics are not good pain medications so I would suggest that you take an appropriate dose of ibuprofen or have your medical provider prescribe something for you I have no way of assessing the severity of your injury over the Internet nor predict if you will get a subsequent injury In order to get those answers you would need to be examined firsthand no pun intended by a medical professional and perhaps have an xray of your hand to rule out a subtle fracture I am assuming this is genital herpes but since I do not know your sex or the extent of your outbreak it really is impossible to offer you any patientspecific advice I can offer you some general suggestion You may find that an antiinflammatory medication like ibuprofen to be more effective than what you are taking Short of seeking medical care in the country you are in and using some cold compresses there is little that can be done Herpes is a virus that tends to run its own course from a mild outbreak to a severe one If you are female you may also want to cover the area with some petrolatum jelly Vaseline to limit the burning effect when you urinate wear loose cotton undies and curse the person who gave it to you yet again Whether she wants to go or not is irrelevant She NEEDS to go because she is having signs of a urinary tract infection perhaps one that is involving the kidney like a pyleonephritis She could also be passing a kidney stone Either one of these could be serious so waiting is not a logical option As you know it is not normal to pee blood hematuria Since the kidneys are located high in the back it would be in her best interest to seek medical care so she can be properly diagnosed and treated It may be up to use to convince here Typically kidney pain is felt in the flank area your sides of the back just below your ribs however some kidney pain is referred to other areas like the groin Isnt sex pleasurable enough without putting menthol on your penis Your partner may not like this cooling sensation either Is it harmful I suspect it is fine but I seriously doubt that the company tested this product on genitals It is usually for sore joints and muscles One can have allergic or adverse responses to ANY product that is used for something that it was not indeed to be used on so obviously your menthol days may be over This unpleasant sensation should end soon Try a little overthecounter hydrocortisone cream to relieve the inflammation It depends on what she considers a partial hysterectomy If she still has one ovary and a uterus she is capable of conceiving but is she does not have a uterus the chance of a pregnancy is zero Based on the detail of this story I would seriously doubt its validity Yes I suspect your sore tongue will improve on its own Not all hymens are created equally Some are thin and break or retract on their own even without intercourse Using tampons can do it I examine many young women have have never had intercourse and do not have a hymen Some are very thick and may bleed when they are stretched or torn during intercourse but not always I dont know if you are a male or female but the urethra of both sexes is very sensitivity to irritation This irritation can come from soap residual or just minor trauma from toilet use It can be caused from a minor infection like yeast This is called urethritis and there can be many different causes Without the ability to examine your friend firsthand and make my own decision whether an xray or other imaging studies are needed there is very little that can be done blindly over the Internet A description no matter how extensive is not a substitute for a proper examination As much as I would like to help she will need to see a medical provider if she would like those important answers In the meantime ice compresses elevating the leg and some ibuprofen will help Perhaps but this would only be used if the causes of your throat or chest pain was thought to be cause by a bacteria that would be sensitive to this potent antibiotic If you are selfdiagnosing and selftreating using an antibiotic prescribed to you in the past that you did not finish or getting an antibiotic prescribed to someone else I would not recommend it You may not have enough for a complete course or you may be taking an antibiotic for a viral infection it would not work at all Most sore throats are viral and the ones that are bacterial tend to be Strep and ciproflxacin is not the drug of choice for a Strep throat There can be many many different causes of chest pain and chest pain is not treated with antibiotics unless of course the cause of the pain was felt to be bacterial Bronchitis for instance can cause chest discomfort but the underlying cause is usually viral Againciprofloxacin would not be appropriate in this case Taking the wrong antibiotic at the wrong dose for the wrong reason can make these worse It is possible but unfortunately I have no way of accurately diagnosing you based solely on the information you have provided It would not be inappropriate for you to try a vaginal yeast medication available overthecounter The pharmacist can help select one for you I am very sorry but without a handson examination and a detailed medical history it would not be possible to blindly offer you a definite diagnosis determine if this mass was cancer and suggest a treatment In order for you to be properly diagnosed I would suggest that you see a surgeonsomeone who can examine this mass perhaps do a biopsy and address this tenyear old problem That would depend on the location of the herniated disk If it was in lumbar area then this would be possible If the disk was in your neck thenno You most definitely have the signs and symptoms of vaginitis but it would be up to your medical provider to determine if this is due to an STD or not There are many types of vaginitis that can cause odor and discharge from bacterial vaginosis and trichomonas so this discharge may need to be microscopically examined or tested in the lab A retained tampon is also a common cause of a malodorous vaginal discharge You will need to see your medical provider so that you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated Bright red blood is almost always coming from the distal parts of the GI tract namely the rectum or anal area The blood can be from a polyp again a hemorrhoid internal or external an anal fissure tiny tear that opens when you have a BM or  There is no way to be sure what is going on unless you see your medical provider and have the source of this blood determined by an exam This is too important to just guess There are plenty of best hospitals I found this to be a reasonable source httphealthusnewscombesthospitals They are listed by specialty including ENT Yes you can rebreak an arm but it will take an xray and a careful examination to make that determination The fact that your arm is hurting more and more each day is an indication that you need to seek handson medical care While there are many other nonfracture reasons for arm pain these cannot be sorted out blindly over the Internet No canker sores aphthous ulcers resolve on their own over time Lidocaine will not cure them but it takes away some of the discomfort during the natural healing process It would not be possible to blindly determine over the Internet if your prior injury  8 years ago  is somehow related to your current symptoms I think it would be wise for you to see an orthopedist and have a handson evaluation and some imaging studies Then you will hopefully know Call the pharmacist that filled this prescription for you They have a list of your medications and may be able to quickly identify it Many generic medications now used by pharmacies will have conflicting numbers or colors and the accurate identification of this drug is really vital You should never take anything that a was not specifically prescribed for you and b not in the original labled childproof container that the pharmacy provided Go with her to her next doctors appointment or inform the prescribing medical provider that she is addicted and abusing this dangerous narcotic You are wise and caring for being concerned but only your wife can stop Have her seek help from a selfhelp 12step program If she is truly in pain seeing a pain specialist is the best way to go Her doctor can refer her There is really no way for me or any medical provider to make blind pain medication suggestions since we do not know her particular case She needs help and you can help her get this help You will need to specifically ask this question to your medical provider  someone who knows the details of your medical history Maybe Anything that throws off your normal gait or balance can cause a domino effect See your medical provider to determine a reason for your symptoms Keep in mind that a person can have more than one issue going on at the same timeyour hip pain could be totally unrelated so get it checked out An Orthopedist would be the best place to start If the pain is worse on your antibiotics then you need to consult your treating medical provider today You may need a change in your antibiotic therapy based on your urine culture hopefully this was done a stronger antibiotic or further evaluation of your kidney pain Perhaps you have a kidney stone Your medical provider may order a kidney ultrasound Genital herpes is painful VERY painful since the herpetic virus involves the nerves in this area Hopefully your medical provider has given you the appropriate antiherpetic medications as well as something for pain This may last for a while and genital herpes tends to be recurrent The antiherpetic medications will help reduce future outbreaks too It would be impossible to diagnose you blindly over the Internet without a thorough medical history review of your test results and a handson examination Just because your current medical providers have not been able to find the cause of your symptoms does not mean that another specialist will come to the same conclusion Get a second opinion from another specialist neurologist or neurosurgeon The most important step is to be properly diagnosed There can be MANY reasons for your elbow pain but tendonitis would be high on the possibilities Once you are properly examined and diagnosed the medical provider can than select the best individualized treatment plan Dont just blame this on your age since tendonitis can affect people of all ages It may include antiinflammatory medications and home physical therapy modalities The spleen is located in the LEFT UPPER QUADRANT under the ribs in a man OR woman There are other anatomical parts in this area the splenic flexure of your intestine left kidney etc that has the potential of causing pain Pain is subjective  only felt by the person with pain  so it is really up to you to determine if your pain warrants a medical evaluation In my opinion ANY undiagnosed pain and any level that is uncomfortable for you or persistent regardless of the location should be medically evaluated An ultrasound is only as accurate at the technician doing the exam so yes things can be missed A cystic mass spermatocele should be able to be seen but if the spermatocele is calcified and no longer filled with nonviable sperm it could be easily missed Spermatoceles are usually no big deal if you are not having symptoms but if you are concerned see a urologist for a higherlevel evaluation Here you go httpchildrenwebmdcomguidegrowingpains I agree with youtesting him for Strep would have been prudent although he was not experiencing a severe sore throat There can be other reasons intestinal virus to account for his array of symptoms Preventing dehydration is essential I suspect he is nauseated so there are medicines that can be prescribed so that he can drink fluids without vomiting Call his medical provider Some immediate signs of dehydration includes lack of tears dry mouth and a reduced urine flow If he is experiencing these he should be reevaluated immediately by his medical provider Call the orthopedistthe one that performed the surgery You are going to need to be reexamined today in most cases If you are still in pain you will need to see a medical provider so you can be properly examined You did not provide sufficient information for me to comment and obviously I have no way of examining your injured testicle over the Internet That diving incident may have caused a traumatic rupture of your eardrum Now when you get water in your ear it is causing pain perhaps because this rupturehole is still open The ONLY way to confirm this possibility and to provide you with some appropriate treatment would be for you to see a medical professional specifically an ENT specialist Dont wait You need to go to the ER again Black tarry smelly stools usually indicate a gastrointestinal bleed stomach esophagus etc that can be lifethreatening GO NOW I dont know the age of your son or if he is having bedwetting issues but frequent nighttime urination could be due to many things For instance if he has a tendency to overdrink liquids in the evening he would more likely need to urinate throughout the night Sometimes little a boy will get irritation of their penis from soaps not rinsed well after a bath or shower laundry detergent or dryer softener residuals left in their clothing etc This can cause an irritant urethritis that makes him feel like he needs to urinate Less common but not out of the question would be a child who is developing diabetes Type 1 It would be wise to discuss this with his medical provider and have some lab tests Another possibility could be a deficiency of a natural hormone called ADH antidiuretic hormone The hormone is supposed to keep us from urinating often at night so if there is a deficiency the body will continue to process urine like we were awake during the day This is one cause of nocturnal enuresis otherwise known as bedwetting He could potentially be a bedwetter but instead is just waking up multiple times to urinate perhaps not sleeping well for fear that he will wet his pants or the bed If he does have an ADH deficiency this can be corrected by a medication called desmopressin DDAVP His medical provider will be able to determine if this would be helpful Get him in to see his medical provider Viral gastroenteritis is very prevalent this time of year Please keep in mind that this is just a blind guess since I have no way of examining you The most important thing is FLUID REPLACEMENT You must stay wellhydrated Dont eat very much for a few more daysmost of these viral infections resolve in about 710 days so hang in there At least you are not vomiting so be greatful In my practice we do not treat diarrhea with drugs at least at this stage but your doctor may have other ideas Your stomach pain may be cramps or gas but if you are concerned the only way that you can be sure is to see your medical provider so you can be examined You can stay will hydrated Sara but it really sounds like you should be examined by a medical provider to determine the reason for your array of abdominal symptoms There are many many causes for abdominal pain and you should not be selfdiagnosing or trying to avoid seeing a medical provider Yes your period can be adversely influenced by an illness but yours has been late for three months Perhaps this is why it is late this month but as you know there can be many reasons for this as well Are you concerned that you are pregnant Chest pains if they are from a cardiac cause are ALWAYS concerning and yes can indicate a dangerous or lifethreatening condition You are at a higher risk for heartrelated problems when you have high cholesterol and are in your 60s While not all heart murmurs are considered dangerous  I do not know what kind you have You should contact your medical provider immediately about these on and off chest pains This could be angina Severe chest pain is a true 911 call so if this is what you are experiencing you need to have immediate emergency intervention Do not discount or ignore these possible warning signs Your body especially your heart could be sending you important messages so it would be wise to listen Could the pain be from your ovary Yes of course Because you are also having problems conceiving you need to make an appointment with your gynecologist for a full workup diagnostic lab tests and some imaging studies of your ovaries I have not heard that calcium citrate is an effective way to relieve menstrual pain I typically recommend ibuprofen or Aleve Obviously I cannot examine you son but he most likely has ADOLESCENT GYNECOMASTIAa hormonal sideeffect of good ol puberty Yes these can be tender Ibuprofen may help and obviously he should avoid trauma to this area or trauma from teasing brothersfriends who like to pinch them or give him a painful twister or purple nurple Ask you son and he will explain what this isThese things can add to the normal discomfort of course Research adolescent gynecomastia on the internet If you are concerned you can see his regular medical provider for a consultation I am sorry but I cannot Without the ability to examine you firsthand there is really no way for me to blindly guess what is causing your pain or bleeding Have you considered seeing a different gynecologist for an official second opinion Since your current one has had several attempts at solving this medical puzzle perhaps a second set of professional eyes will be more successful Two doctor heads are better than just one in these morechallenging cases I dont know enough about your particular case nothing in fact to know if you are a surgical candidate or not I think it is a big jump from failure of antiinflammatory cream to the operating room however A choice of specialists depends on where the nerve impingment starts If it is in your back a neurosurgeon or an orthopedic surgeon would be the specialist of choice Tylenol acetaminophen is not an NSAID It will help pain but not inflammation You are apparently trying to get pregnant since you are not using any form of contraception Assuming your partner is capable of fathering a child it should only be a matter of time assuming you are capable of getting pregnant These things of course cannot be determined over the Internet Take a pregnancy test but be prepared to repeat it in a week or so You can also see your gynecologist for an exam or more sensitive pregnancy blood test Since you are also have an array of symptoms that may or may not be related to a pregnancy an exam would be highly recommended There can be other causes for black stools other than a gastric stomach bleed Bleeding from the stomach melena causes black TARRY stools Blood in other areas of your intestinal tract may be occult hidden or appear as brown bright red in your stools either mixed in or streaked If you stool tests for occult blood are consistently negative you need to do several on different days over a longer period of time then you most likely do not have bleeding as a cause of your darker stools Spinachleafygreens and the bismuth in Pepto Bismol are common nonbleeding causes Keep working with your doctor to get your relativelymild anemia in control and certainly investigate the reason for pain under your breastsince it still could be gastrointestinaly related The first and most important consideration would be an infection so please try and get a sooner appointmentsome things should not wait so call the doctor personally if you can There are other anatomical problems tiny fissure cuts impacted tampons etc that can cause vaginal odor andor pain but again an examination is essential A guess based solely on vague symptoms is not the same as an accurate diagnosis and treatment You will need to get examined by a medical provider Testicular pain can be caused by many thingsorchitis an infection of the testicle itself or epididymitis an infection or inflammation of the sperm collecting tube There are other causes of course The ONLY way for you to have this twoweek old issue properly assessed is for you to see a medical provider for a careful examination As much as you may be avoiding this exam your testicles  both of them  are important and deserve an examination I do not know anything about you or your medical history but based solely on the brief information in your question I would say that worsening painand an enlarged spleen would meet the criteria for going to the hospital instead of waiting It should not be a problem He has not been taking it long enough for a physical or psychological dependence It is always best to check with his doctor however who may want to decrease his dose rather than stop it Pain specialists often have there own method of management One possibility for sudden excruciating foot pain usually the big toe is the most painful would be  Assuming you are not having muscle cramps a spider bite or an injury this possibility would be high on my list You would need to see your medical provider right away so that you can have a simple lab test If your medical provider feels that you do have gout this can be promptly treated and you can get some immediate relief True keloids are just hypertrophic scars They are not cancerous and they typically do not itch or cause pain so it would be best to see your medical provider so this keloid can be properly examined No Marijuana is not safe in pregnancy There are other medications that may be help but your OB must prescribe them That is a safe dose but you may not be taking enough The maximum dose of ibuprofen is really 3200 mg and you are taking 400 mg Since I dont know your medical history or your weight so you can address you dosage with your doctor Medically you may be able to your dose to 600 mg each time up to 3 or 4 times per day if your arthritis warrants it I have no idea with KIND of blood work your doctor has ordered You do have a right to know so you will need to ask your doctor or the lab The code you have listed is a diagnosis code  not a type of blood test You should wait at least 60 or 70 more years before you consider smoking again Specific recommendations regarding smoking after a tooth extraction should ONLY come from the oral surgeon that did the work Those sutures are most likely the dissolvable type and it can take weeks for them to dissolve Call your oral surgeon and serious consider permanent smoking cessation Migraines are vascular headaches and not all headaches are migraines Migraine does not mean a severe headache it is just one type of over a hundred different kinds of headaches The type of headache you may be describing is one of the more common typesa muscletension headache but the pain under the breast is not a typical symptom Muscletension headache can certainly come from the neck Since you cannot be blindly diagnosed over the Internet I would suggest that you see your medical provider for a proper examination There are only a few things that can be done for middle ear effusion fluid 1 You can wait it out but after three months you need to see an ENT 2 Decongestants nasal corticosteroids etc have all been used with limited success Sometimes it helpssometimes it doesnt Antibiotics are not usually helpful since this is more of plumbing and ventilation issuenot an infection 3 An ENT may need to surgical drain the fluid tympanostomy or suction and place tubes in your ears If you were properly diagnosed with influenza Tamiflu will not help any other viral infection know that this drug does not cure the flu or treat specific symptoms It briefly shortens the course of the flu and alleviates the severity Immediate or dramatic improvemenst in flusymptoms are usually not seen If you are still having a sore throat on day two of the flu then you can treat this symptom separately gargling with warm salt water taking ibuprofen for the paininflammation and drinking lots of fluids Throat lozenges can also help Yesyou can use probiotics but that will not solve the sore bottom Not all diaper rashes are the samesome are caused simply by the acidic irritation of having diarrhea but some can be yeast or even bacterial Each would be treated differently of course Since I cant diagnose your baby over the Internet I can make a little suggestion that I use for my own patients Use a combination of an antiyeast cream over the counterthe pharmacist can help you pick one AND 1 hydrocortisone cream for the inflammation Rub a small amount well in those sore areas and then cover this with a barrier cream or ointment AD Desitin zinc oxide Vaseline etc Change the diaper frequently and make sure you wipe of ALL traces of stool even if you have to give them a bath If the area is bleeding or getting worse you will need to have it examined by the pediatrician You dont have to be asking any questions let her medical provider do that for you during an examination Finding a specific cause of severe pain is more than just asking questionsit is analyzing the answers and correlating those answers with physical examination findings lab tests and imaging studies You did not provide any information about the type of pain location etc that your daughter was experiencing so it is important that she see a medical professional If this is a testiclar torsion you need to go to the ERnow A torsion is a medical emergency Unfortunately I have no way to reach out and examine you and order a doppler ultrasound to make the diagnosis You will need to be examined by a medical provider to find the source of the bleeding It is most likely that the sexual practice caused some trauma to your vaginal area Andyou will need to have a long serious talk withyour boyfriend about good touch and bad touch He will need some lessons on proper foreplay I feel that you should be MEDICALLY diagnosed first a chiropractic assessment is not sufficient Before any home treatment of back pain that has lasted a month it would be wise for you to see a back specialist MD and have some diagnostic tests first There are plenty of exercises and stretching regimes but getting a definitive diagnosis is the most important thing first Of course Many fractures go undetected so you will need to see your medical provider and have an xray By this time you may see xray evidence of an OLD fracture but the fact that you are still having pain indicates a need for a good examination to find the reason Ibuprofen is a safe and effective pain medication with antiinflammatory benefits You may need to see TWO professionals a dentist and your primary care medical provider if this ends up not being a dental problemunlikely See the dentist first You need to see your medical provider so you can be properly examined to find the source of the blood Bright red blood tends to originate from the anal area or lower rectum so a source can usually be found relatively easily Some possible causes include an anal fissure a small tear at the anal opening often caused by constipation hemorrhoids or even polyps It is very important for you to be examined I have no way of determining if your arm is broke over the Internet since I dont know the details of the injury location severity or have the ability to examine you Only an xray can give you that answer Other causes to consider that may account for your symptoms would be nerve compression from the contusion sustained during the incident Again you will need to see your medical provider to have a definitive answer  not something that can be done in this forum These could be pilonidal sinus TRACTS or openings based on your description These areas are capable of forming cysts or infections abscesses but as long as you are not having any problems just leave them alone If you are a male make sure to keep hair from these areas Mine went away when the podiatrist told me to wear different SHOES Yes the possibility always exists for it to come back depending on the aggravating circumstances Sometimes This is called referred ear pain Because of the muscle connection from your neck to the area behind your ear the mastoid area pain in this sternocleidomastoid muscle can cause pain to be referred to the ear Pain can also be referred to the ear from problems in the mouth TMJ lymph nodes salivary glands and throat so if you are having problems in any of those areas please see your medical provider so you can be properly examined Dont forget that ear pain can also be a problem IN the ear too A skilled phlebotomist can find a vein by just feeling palpating it A visual view is not necessary Apply a warm compress and allowing the arm to hang down prior to the blood draw would be helpful and ask for a phlebotomist that is skilled drawing blood from  They are used to those tiny hardtofind veins Because of nerve pathway medical problems in the mouth may cause pain to be referred to the ear Allow her to be examined by her primary care medical provider first There may be a logical reason for her symptoms and hopefully and easy solution The pain may not be originating in the spermatocele Conditions like epididymitis can also cause pain in this area as well as tortion twisting or infection It would be in your best interest to see a healthcare provider so you can have this new symptom properly examined Yes This is called referred ear pain Because of the nerve pathway a dental problem can cause pain to be felt in the ear See your gynecologist to make sure there is not an underlying structrual or anatomical issue like a retroverted tilted uterus etc Unless your sexual partner is a trained psychotherapist he should not be diagnosing you with an emotional problem or implicate a trust issue Most of these issues can be solved but more information is needed Many things can cause heel pain from heel spurs rough areas on the heel bone to tendon and plantar fascia problems Even improper shoes can cause heel pain Your first and most important step is to see a good podiatrist for an examination This is really the only way you can be accurately diagnosed and treated Treatment would depend on your diagnosis of course and may include medications orthotics shoe inserts recommendations for a different type of shoe or in severe cases of spurs even surgery Six months is a long time Get it checked out so you can start walking without pain again The left upper abdomen is the location of the spleen and splenic enlargement is common with mono If you were TESTED for Strep rapid Strep test or culture then your diagnosis was probably accurate but if the medical provider just looked at the throat and pronounced that you have Strep then there is a 50 chance your original diagnosis was about as accurate as a coin toss Ask for a mono test EBV panel and get that abdomen properly examined That would depend on the NAME of the pain killer Both men and women have equal chances of getting adverse side effects of medications Call your dentist so that you can be examined again This is not normal I cant really answer that important questionnamely since I have no way of seeing this skin eruption first hand by examination One of many considerations should be shingles herpes zoster but this is just a blind guess based solely on your very vague description I would suggest that you see a medical professional so you can have this properly diagnosed and treated That is what the acupuncturists claim but that depends on the CAUSE of your pain and the skill of the acupuncture expert They only way you will known is to try it yourself but discuss it with your medical provider first Sureassuming you can medically take ibuprofen it will be just fine for orthopedic pain control It would not be prudent to make a blind guess Since I have no way of examining you no photos please I suggest that you see your womens health specialistgynecologist or primary care provider for an exam Not knowing your age it could be a cystocele or rectocele but again it is important to get properly examined As you knowI cant see or examine you and your description is vague Look up ganglion cyst on the Internet  this is one possibility of many I dont know anything about your boyfriendhis medical history his habits medications etcto be able to blindly offer treatment over the Internet for his abdominal pain While the pain could be related to gas distention from being constipated there can be NUMEROUS other considerations that can only be sorted out by a medical provider during an examination Prednisone has plenty of sideeffects but it can be very beneficial when properly used It does not cause fibromyalgia however As a matter of fact no one really knows what causes fibromyalgia I have no way of examining you over the Internet to give you a definite answer only your doctor can do that but one possibility would be a common and temporary condition of preteens and teenagers called SEVERS DISEASE  You can look this up on the Internet and run this possibly by your doctor Female jock itch tinea cruris would not be high on my list based on your brief question I suspect she has FOLLICULITIS  an infection of the hair follicles common in those who shave their pubic area  a fad that is now all the rage in the teen and young adult crowd Public hair tends to be coarse or curly prone to ingrown hairs but a relative dull razor can cause numerous microcuts that can become easily infection She is more likely to have a bacterial component than fungus Since this in this much pain a call to her medical provider may get a prescription for an oral antibiotic or at least a potent antibiotic cream stronger than the overthecounter A firsthand examination may be required so prepare her A gastroenterologist is a licensed and highlytrained physician Many were primary care clinicians before they specialized While a vaginal exam may not be integral part of hisher practice finding the underlying reason for undiagnosed abdominal pain may require more than just a short trip up the colon or down the throat to the stomach Pelvic causes for abdominal pain are really high on the list so this clinician is most likely being very thorough They are definitely allowed to do this exam if there is a justifiable reason to do so Now if your podiatrist or a chiropractor wanted to do a vaginal exam I would call that highlysuspicious I was unable to view your pictures but even if I could a pictures is not worth a thouand words when it comes to an accurate diagnosis Since I cannot examine your toes firsthand a blind diagnosis is not possible Since you have had this problem for years my suggestion is for you to see your primary care medical provider or a podiatrist for a proper examination diagnosisand treatment How about seeing a medical provider today so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated You may need a prescription antibiotic NSAIDs are considered to be safe if you have hypertension but I have no idea if they are safe for YOU since I do not know the details of your medical history or the type of blood pressure medications you on My advise is for you to get a patientspecific answer from your medical provider  the one treating your high blood pressure Are you running or exercising naked There are penile conditions that can cause this reaction but you would need to see a urologist to be properly examined Penile retraction can occur because of a ample fat pad in this area or weaker connective tissue Exactly why your penis is deciding to hide during exercise is really a mystery until you see a urologist Since this is causing your pain when you pull your penis back out from its temporary hidden position I strongly advise you to get it properly examined There can be but keep in mind that a person can have more than one medical problem going on at the same time so your symptoms may be unrelated See your medical provider so this can be properly evaluated The bladder stones may have started in your kidneys and migrated south to the bladder Some of the small ones can pass in your urine but bigger ones can be problematic especially in your kidney Passing a stone even a tiny one from the kidney to the bladder is a very painful experience Hopefully the doctor you are seeing is a urologist If not you will need to get a referral This is not rare I have been theredone that Kidney stones should be analyzed so you may be given a screen or filter to strain your urine The stones can be sent to the lab to determine their composition This may help your doctors prevent new stones from forming You need to drink lots and lots of water Stones that are trapped in the kidney may need to be pulverizedblasted with sound waves until they can pass This procedure is called a lithotripsy Sometimes larger bladder stones ureter stones or kidney stones will need to be surgically removed Just an odd coincidence There would be no medical explanation for this Of course you need to get it checked out I am surprised that it took you a year to get to this point There are many many causes of ear pain including many causes that do not involve the ear itself It is going to take a thorough systemic diagnostic workup to get to the bottom of this yearlong issue Gastritis from his alcohol ingestion would be high on the list of possibilities Alcohol use can lead to gastric bleeding and ulcers as well There is no way to accurately diagnose your husbands stomach burning over the Internet so I would strongly suggest that he a stop drinking and b see a medical professional to start the diagnostic process As you know I do not know anything about you or the details of your casesurgeries to be able to address this very important issue My heart goes out to you You need to find the BEST spine surgeon in your area or even out of your area for a highlevel evaluation Make sure to collect all of your medical records and imaging studies before seeking this second opinion A tapeworm or gallbladder disease in a fiveyear old is extremely rare so instead of trying to diagnose her it would be best for her to see a pediatric gastroenterologist for a diagnostic workup There is really no way to blindly narrow down the many possibilties over the Internet There are no set rulesevery person every UTI every treatment regime etc is uniquely different It is even possible that your lowback pain is unrelated to your UTI Since I do not know anything about you your medical history details of your UTI it would not be possible to specifically comment about your particular case My advice would be for you to contact your medical provider  the person who is currently treating you and familiar with your case Since you are still having symptoms it is likely you will need to be reexamined and perhaps have some additional diagnostic tests to make sure your UTI has indeed resolved I cannot believe that you are worried or embarrassed by a crooked butt crack You are who you are crooked crack and all As you know I cant see it to specifically comment and please do not post a photo but I do not know of any medical conditions that would be considered hazardous due to this condition Plastic surgery can do wonders if you want to spend the money to have a butt reconstruction Underwear works fine too and is a lot cheaper Dont show your butt to anyone that doesnt deserve to see it If they deserve to see it then they will most likely be very understanding and kind Tell anyone who asks that this is a genetic aberration common in royal families Human beings are full of anatomical variations  big ears funny eyes weird hairlines ugly feetyou name it and I have probably seen it I find them fascinatingIf everyone looked the same it would be boring You cannot be adequately diagnosed by symptoms alone You will need to SEE a medical professional for a proper examination and thorough medical history in order to narrowdown the MANY possibilities that can account for your pain This cannot be done blindly over the Internet Harmful No but often unnecessarily I agree with youjust take the medication that you need to help control the annoying symptoms Some combination cold medications do not even make senseincluding a decongestant that drains mucous combined with an antihistamine that dries it up and a cough expectorant that makes you cough combined with a cough suppressant that stops the cought That is really like taking Kaopectate and a laxative at the same time The anus and the stomach are on opposite ends of the gastrointestinal tract  quite a distance away I would not think that an anal fissure would cause any stomach pain at least pain as a direct relationship Certainly if you are having severe anal pain this may potentially cause nonspecific constitutional symptoms upset stomach nausea headache etc but as a rule they would be considered two isolated symptoms Those medications are chemically compatible to be taken at the same time assuming you currently have clinical indications to take BOTH It is never a good idea to selfprescribe an antibiotic left over from a previous infection Can I assume he is in a long leg or short leg cast or is he in a boot Any child known to have a tibial fracture one who is screaming in pain needs to be evaluated by his orthopedist as soon as possible This would not be considered normal one and half weeks after the injury The next step would be to see a gastoenterlogist  someone that can visually inspect your stomach with a fiberoptic scope or at least run some additional diagnostic tests Medications used to block or reduce your stomach acid or an antispasmotic medication taken prior to meals would be one treatment consideration once you are properly diagnosed You need to see your medical provider so you can be properly examined There is absolutely no way to blindly determine the cause of your symptoms without a detailed medical history location of pain severity associated symptoms etc and a thorough examination of your abdomen Any medical provider should be able to help You most likely have an infection but a concern would be a retained foreign body a tiny wood sliver so make sure the health care professional considers this possibility Many things epididymitis orchitis kidney stones testicular cancer Dont try and solve this problem yourself based on Internet information See a UROLOGIST and have a thorough examination Testicular pain is not something a man should ignore The ENT should be an expert in these matters and hopefully have the equipment in the office to clean the ear canal usually a vaccuum It is possible that he inadvertently ruptured your eardrum in the process but this is just a guess since I cant examine you You could see another ENT but there will be an expense If you go to the ER there will be a BIG expense If the ENT caused the problem he should bend over backwards to fix it I am not sure what kind of drops he gave you but your pain may settle down soon Even if you did have an accidental eardrum rupture it should quickly heal Unless a medical provider could examine you firsthand and take a detailed medical history it would not be prudent to make a blind guess over the Internet as to what this lump might be A picture is not helpful unfortunately A medical provider would need to carefully examine not only this lump of concern but examine the entire area from the neck up It could be a lymph node cyst or yes it could be a sign of a serious mass  one that may need to be imaged CT or MRI or perhaps even biopsied You cannot make this determination from a photo or a vague description You are the trustee of your body It is your responsibility to take this seriously and be properly examined Many things can cause an accelerated heart rate including certain types of nasal sprays For you alcohol may be acting as a stimulant so perhaps you need to cut back on your intake to see if it is doserelated You should run this by your medical provider so you can have your heart properly examined Your ovaries are small and usually buried under a significant amount of intestines and other abdominal layers of fat and other tissue It would not be likely that you could see or feel your ovaries Since you cannot be examined over the Internet it would be in your best interest to see a medical professional for a firsthand examination to determine the true nature of this bulge you are seeing Not enough information Rather than spend your time in selfdiagnosis from the flu to reasons for your head pain like sinusitis it may be more beneficial for you to seek proper medical care The appendix is in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen the right kidney is located just under the ribs on the right flank different locations Kidney stones tend to cause blood in the urine obvious blood or microscopic blood seen on a urinalysis appendicitis does not The answer is often solved by a careful medical history examination and a CT scan Only if your TMJ and knee pain is BOTH caused by a type of arthritis otherwise most clinicians would consider them to be separate problems I am not sure what type of doctor you are seeing but you need to be carefully examined by a ophthalmologist  an MD that specializes in eye disorders Maybe your doctor should refer you to a back specialist orthopedist for a higherlevel evaluation Musculoskeletal issues in the neck can be very complex so you will need a careful medical history thorough examination of your neckshoulders and most likely some imaging studies Dont ever worry about asking your doctor too many questions They are not working for freethey get wellpaid to address your concerns Unless your doctor actually did a test rapid strep test or culture to CONFIRM that you have Strep the diagnosis could be incorrect You may have a viral infection or even Mono Obviously since I cant examine you I have no way of making that important diagnostic call Most viral infections improve on day four even if you do nothing so if you are not improving you need to see your medical provider again A coincidence Blood donation does not cause kidney pain There is really nothing topical in the form of a cream that will help the skin lesion discomfort There is an analgesic syrup for the inside of the mouth viscous lidocaine by prescription that you can swab if her medical provider prescribes it Ibuprofen helps with the lesions on the skin unless her pediatrician gives her a codeinecontaining pain medication I do not believe there are any scientific studies that proves acupuncture will reduce bone spurs but if you are feeling better with this therapy it really doesnt matter A reduction in pain and inflammation may be all that you need at this point so if acupuncture is providing help keep it up Lots of thingsarthritis tendonitis and even gout See your medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated The doctor can prescribe whatever limit he or she feels comfortable with and what the insurance company will cover Because many narcotic pain medications are diverted and resold on the market for quick cash doctors are very careful about prescribing large quantities of these highlyaddictive and potentially dangerous drugs No doctor will want to lose their medical licenses over this so many will not even prescribe them at all If you are having painpain so severe that it requires chronic narcotic medications you should be under the care of a pain specialist It is not possible to offer you a number  your statistical chances of becoming pregnant There are just too many unknown factors to consider I can say that the Depo Provera is an excellent contraceptive but not 100 When you have unprotected intercourse you are really taking a chance with just about any contraceptive method short of sterilization tubal ligation Could you be pregnant Yes that would be possible You would need to see your medical provider and have a very accurate pregnancy test ordered or take a few home pregnancy tests There can be many reasons for a woman to have sharp lower abdominal pain other than a pregnancy so you would benefit from having a handson examination This is really the only way to get a sure answer The back pain you are experiencing may have nothing to do with your scoliosis but may have everything to do with problems in your LOWER back I would suggest that you see a good back specialist orthopedist for a thorough examination Talk to your parents and have them take you to see a medical provider right away It would be impossible to adequately evaluate a person with a headache blindly over the Interent let alone determine if they had a brain tumor I dont know the details of your casewhy you have been on narcotics for a long timebut perhaps it is time for you to see a new pain specialist Gonorrhea is one of the main causes of PID Pelvic Inflammatory Disease and yes this can be very painful You need to be under the ongoing care of a primary care medical provider or gynecologist until this STD has been cured Without the ability to examine you firsthand it would not be possible to determine the cause or significance of the pain you are experiencing now Only the medical provider who is treating you and has examined you can make that important call The most common complication of a burn a second degree burn based on your description would be a secondary skin infection A burn that is now red angry and painful may be infected The only way for you to be sure is to see a medical professional and be examineda description is just too vague to make a decision like that blindly See an ENT if you do not improve Otitis media middle ear infection with effusion fluid can cause vertigo but so can inner ear disorders Since I really have no way to confirm or dispute your diagnosis or justify the use of steroids in your case seeing an ENT for a higherlevel diagnostic examination is appropriate however two days of treatment has not given the treatment plan an adequate trial Nothe rate of fingernail growth will not changeaccelerate if the other nail is removed As a matter of fact the old nail can help protect the very sensitive nail bed as the new nail gradually grows out again This is an issue that only your urologist can or should answer Anytime that you see blood in the toilet it can only be from about two sources the urine or the bowels Since you recently had surgery for kidney stones you are likely to form more so another CT scan of the kidney may be in your future especially since you are in pain Even tiny kidneys stones can cause severe pain if they are lodge in the ureter so it would be best not to ignore these symptoms and consult your urologist If you cannot see your urologist quickly then an emergency room visit is appropriate They will most likely order an immediate CT scan of the kidney with your history and symptoms I have been there and done that stent and all so my heart goes out to you It would not be likely that any vaginal yeast infection would cause right lower back pain White strips are not a clinical sign of Strep so nothis is not typical If you had a confirming lab test rapid strep or culture then your diagnosis was most likely accurate and you will be feeling better soon assuming you are on the correct antibiotic If you were diagnosed clinically  just by a visual examination  then there is a 5050 chance that your diagnosis was incorrect and you do NOT have Strep but rather a viral infection Viruses do not respond at all to antibiotics and one virus in particular  the one that causes mono can actually become worse when you are taking antibiotics Having agonizing pain is NOT normal You need to immediately contact the doctor or clinic that performed this procedure and be examined as soon as possible I dont know the details of your case not all fractures are the same to be able to determine if pain is appropriate four weeks after casting but my guess would be NOit is not normal You need to see your orthopedist again for a reevaluation Sometimes improperly placed casts can cause painful pressure areas or your fracture may have shifted As you know I have no way of looking at your eardrum over the Internet to give you the okay to fly You would need to see a medical provider to make sure you do not have middle ear effusion fluid or an infection You most likely have ETD Eustachian Tube Dysfunction so there are no quick fixes The Sudafed was a good try but shortacting nasal decongestants like NeoSynephrine may offer temporary relief if you do it before you fly assuming you can use this type of medication Many people will take ibuprofen before the flight for the antiinflammatory benefits Most planes are wellpressurized so landing may be your problem Chew gum so you can frequently swallow and then hope for the best Strep assuming your selfdiagnosis is correct can cause kidney infections as well but I would have no idea if they are related in your case without a handson examination and a thorough medical history White pockets on your throat is NOT a definitive sign of Strep Why dont you see your medical provider for a rapid strep test urinalysis and a proper examination This would answer your kidney stone and infection concern Your mother needs to be seen and examined by a medical professional There is no way that the severity of her injuries could be determined blindly over the Internet A child is not likely to die from a simple urinary tract infection In the unlikely event that the infection went to the kidneys and then caused septicemia a serious problem could emerge but she is fine nowon the right antibiotic so dont worry I am not sure either since I cant see or examine you As a matter of fact you cant see inside your own ear either so it would be advisable for you to see a medical provider someone who can The most logical reason for your ear pain is an infection so you are correct Fingernails are not the cleanest part of our body so when they scratch the very sensitive skin lining of the ear canal an infection can happen These infections can be mild and only need topical antibiotics or they can worsen and cause a deep painful infection called cellulitis Most cases of bronchitis are VIRAL and do not need antibiotics so this could be one reason why you are not getting better as fast as you though It is okay to take amoxicillin with ibuprofen If you have failed to get better on your doctors treatment regime you need to go back and be reexamined otherwise he will just assume you are better Inform him otherwise How do you know this is your right ovary and not your appendix located in the same area Since selfdiagnosis is often not accurate and severe abdominal pain needs the services of a good medical provider I would strongly suggest that you get properly diagnosed There can be many thing causing your painfrom an ovarian cyst a pelvic infection to appendicitis so please get it checked outTODAY Are you sure it is just a kidney infection and not a kidney STONE You may need a CT scan of your kidneys to be sure Keflex is an appropriate drug assuming the pathogen causing your infection has been identified and is sensitive to this drug Find out about your urine culture report IF you are still having severe pain you most definitely need to consult the medical provider who is treating you Ice compresses and ibuprofen assuming you can medically use this type of medication Wear opentoed shoes for a while Elevate your legfoot You may want to consider buddy taping your injured toe to an adjacent uninjured toe to give it more support You need to see your medical provider again You may have postherpetic neuralgia  a painful condition after having Shingles There are treatments for this but they are prescriptions Pancreatic cancer pain can be severe Since pain medication is very patientspecific it would be best to have a pain specialist manage this persons pain The best medication for one person may not be the best medication for another Any opioid pain medication can cause constipation Milder pain medicines like ibuprofen or acetaminophen do not If you need to take opioid medications ask your medical provider about taking concurrent stool sofeners at the same time This issue has come up many times on WebMDs Ear Nose and Throat Community  and there is a few things you can try You are correct The weight of your head on your pillow is either restricting circulation to your outer ear pinna or you are causing some nerve compression You can adjust your sleeping position to avoid this overcompression but old habits are hard to break An ENT colleague suggested that you get a foam pillow and cut out an earsized crater in it This way your ear can rest in a little bed of its own without causing undo compression It may work but this is not something you can buyyou will need to make it The worst that can happen is that it will not help You can try softer pillows or pillows of different shapes as well Some people will sleep on the other side of the bed so they will tend to turn their head a different way Even if you slept with your wrist flexed under the pillow you could wake up with a numb tingling hand so the the only answer to this problem is either changing your sleep position or creating that special pillow I am sorry to address this urgent concern so late but the answer is yes This is why you should NEVER use Qtips to clean the INSIDE of your ears Ear wax is not dirt and it does not need to be removed In most cases the damage was caused to your ear canal or you accidently ruptured your eardrum Most of these should heal without any permanent hearing loss but occasional a severe injury to the middle ear structures from a Qtip can cause some permanent damage If you are complete well nowand have normal hearingand no blood or drainage from the ears you are probably fine The only way for you to be completely sure is to see a medical provider and have your ears properly examined Nowgo throw away those Qtips It could be a serious problem if you ignore the symptoms so it would be wise to see a medical provider and have a proper examination A common cause would be an anal fissure  a tiny tear in the ring of the anus This is common in people who strain for bowel movements or who are prone to constipation Hemorrhoids are another possibility Lesscommon but possible would simply be perianal irritation caused by a bacterial or yeast infection Rather than worry about the cause or wonder if you have something serious take the very next important step See a medical provider and know for sure Yesyou can just stop taking Advil ibuprofen There will be no health consequences Why would you want to swtich to plain aspirin Aspirin can have more sideeffects than ibuprofen depending on your dose and how you use it so it would be wise to run this by your medical provider  someon who knos your medical history Yesthere are many different types of arthritis adn a 17 year old can definitely get it Unfortunatelly it would not be possible for me or any medical provider to blindly identify this blister based solely on your description You would need to be examined firsthand by a medical professional You cannot accurately diagnose a rotator cuff tear by symptoms alone and certainly not as a selfdiagnosis Even your doctor may have difficulty unless an MRI is ordered Take it from someone who had a rotator cuff tearYou need to see a good orthopedist and probably need to have imaging studies like an MRI Many offices have policies that they can only give HIV results in person You did not say you were tested but you should be testednot once but several times over the next year just to be sure If you had unprotected sex with someone who is HIV positive you were most likely exposed It is not possible to determine individual risk based on this one or more sexual encounters so this is why you need to be tested a few times and start using condoms In order for you to be properly diagnosed you would need to see a medical provider for an examination and possibly some imaging studies Appendicitis would be listed among the many possibilities to account for anyones abdominal pain but be advised that their are many Since you have been symptomatic for five days now it is time for you to get some handson answers An emotional trauma takes longer to heal than a physical trauma but everyone heals on their own time line There is no way to predict how long it will take for you to get over this event since we all have our own coping mechanisms You will need to see your medical provider for a thorough medical history and examination It would not be possible to determine a cause or a solution to this issue blindly over the Internet based solely on your brief posting Are you a male or female A topical anesthetic like lidocaine jelly can be used to help control the brief discomfort but you certainly cannot be placed under general anesthesia Pancreatic problems can cause left flank pain So can lower lobe lung problems intenstinal disorders and spine issues Even shingles can cause flank pain Make sure your medical provider keeps looking Persistent knee pain lasting over a month from a jogging injury where there was a loud pop could be many things but a full or partial tear of one of the ligaments tendons or menesci would be high on the list as well as cartilege tears It would be in your fiances best interest to see a good orthopedist he should have done this weeks ago He may need some imaging studies like an MRI of that painful knee Your first and most important step is to get an accurate diagnosis which is based on examination findings You may need to see an orthopedist for a higherlevel examination If the orthopedist feels that you would need imaging studies then so be it but right now getting an MRI may be premature Antiinflammatory medications can definitiely help but again having a definitive diagnosis is critical so get a referral to a specialist If your tinnitus is related to your VNG test it should resolve in a few days to a week As you may know tinnitus is common in many inner ear disorders like Menieres It could be just be a coincidence that you have tinnitus today but then again it could have some unknown association People getting a VNG certainly can having dizziness or even nauseavomiting but tinnitus would not be a common test sideeffect He may have adolescent gynecomastia  an unwelcomed hormonal gift associate with puberty This is relatively common but an embarrassment to boys Dont get me wrongteen boys admire breasts but they dont want to grow their own You can find lots of information about this temporary condition on the Internet so you both can read it This condition can last about two years and can involve both breasts not just one There is nothing medically that can be done to stop it and nearly all will eventually resolve I have seen thousands in my practice and only one had to have surgery to remove this breast tissue If he doesnt want to take off his shirt at home or wear one at the pool let him Dont let other siblings or friends tease him either Xrays basically only see bone air and areas of calcification An ultrasound can see soft tissue like cysts Having clinical information from both tests is often very helpful when your medical provider is trying to get an accurate diagnosis No spicy food does not cause ovarian problems Your GI system is the likely source if there is a relationship Depending on the size of the stone stones in the kidney can move into the ureter the tube between the kidney and the bladder If it moves to the neck of the kidney it will be painful as well Most people who have had kidney stones myself included will agree that kidney stones HURTSa lot When you are having a 9 on a 10 scale of pain how do we know you had just one kidney stone The one causing the pain could have been the size of a grain of salt and still cause incredible pain on its journey to the bladder I am guessing but I suspect that you passed a tiny one before the ER even did your CT scan Unfortunately humans cannot absorb water through the skin so it is back to the shaved ice again sucking on popsicles or just taking tiny sips through a juice box straw Hopefully his doctor gave him something for paina little Tylenol with codeine eliier will help him a great deal but you will need to get someone to call in a prescription for him If his throat hurts less he will be more likely to drink Signs of dehydration include a lack of tears a dry mouth and a reduction in his urine output I do not know anything about you or your medical history not even your sex and I do not have any way of examining you over the Internet As much as I would like to help you you need more than just a blind guesssomeone needs to examine you to determine the causereason for your symptoms Yes you most definitely need to see your doctor so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated It would be impossible to determine the nature and significance of this lump based solely on a brief description You can let it alone and wait until your body pushes it out extrication or your ENT specialist can remove it for you At age 17 most girlsespecially those that went through puberty at an early age will not be getting any taller If she is having low back pain it is not likely growing pains but rather related to muscleskeletal strain from her sports or dancing See a medical provider so she can be properly examined and diagnosed Assuming you are not hitting you head on the bed during this intimate moment one likely cause would be an orgasmic headache You can find information about this on an Internet search Keep in mind that there are hundreds of possibilitiesmuscle tension headaches a migrainelike vascular headache high blood pressure or  If this keeps happening it would be in your best interest to be professionally examined and diagnosed Many things can cause that type of pain and you cannot make a diagnosis by one symptom alone This is the location of your STOMACH and various stomach problems like gastritis or ulcers can cause pain There is a large portion of your large intestine in this area so even trapped intestinal gas can cause pain but not constantly The constant pain is the part that is most concerning Because of nerve pathways pain in the liver and gallbladder location on upper right side under the ribs as well as pain in the pancreas or spleen could be felt in this area The causes are numerous It is in your best interest to have a THOROUGH diagnostic workup including some special imaging tests to find that answer If you have classic signs of appendicitisworsening right lowerquadranat abdominal paintenderness then why wait In the past we would watch patients in the ER for several hours but now the diagnostic test of choice is an abdominal CT scan Most medical professionals would prefer that you do not wait I dont know if you are male or female but women would also need to consider ovarian or tube problems that could cause similar pain A CT would rule this out as well Get him in to see his medical provider RIGHT AWAY This is not normal and he will need to have some imaging studies of his brain MRI or CT or both as well as see a good pediatric neurologist They can use it if it seems to help but it is NOT going to cause them to loose weightor loose weight just in the belly The fact they are exercising and eating better is the KEY to weight loss not belly wraps Yeshydrocortisone ointment 1 overthecounter will help but you should also use a stool softener for a while so the fissures will not reopen when you have a bowel movement You may need a more comprehensive cardiac workup so my advice to you would be to see the best internistcardiologist in your area for some additional tests I dont know what studies were done in the hospital but you may need others perhaps even an angiogram If your doctor or neurosurgeon states that you need surgery then there should not be an issue Both companies will pay for the surgery if it is medicallynecessaryit should not take a year for approval It is time for you to become assertive and find out where the problem lies Drained Probably not It would be wise to be examined by your medical provider so this lump can be properly diagnosed and treated See a dentist that specializes in TMJ temporomandibular joint disorders You will need a thorough examination and some imaging studies Although I am sympathetic to your financial constraints the ONLY way that you can be properly diagnosed is to see your medical provider and be properly examined RLS does not cause the type of excruciating thigh pain that you are describing so you may need a diagnostic workup When our car breaks down we often have to get it fixed even if money is tight Your body deserves the same respect and allocation of your resources You can try calling your doctor  someone who knows you and your medical history  first and explain your problem but I suspect a handson examination will be recommended Any patientspecific treatment instructions should be done by the medical provider who is caring for you but if you do not need the pain relief from Vicodin now you can switch to ibuprofen at any time if your doctor is okay with it The Vicodin will not be bioeffective after six hours or so so anytime after that We have several friends who are bipolar and they do not steal There is no relationship to her stealing to the bipolar disordersshe just steals More concerning would be a possible addiction to narcotic pain medication Hide your pillskeep them out of your medicine cabinet where she is likely snooping when using the bathroom Put the pain medication bottle in there no pills with some MMs and note asking her to get some help Your gallbladder is located on your right side but gallbladder pain may not have anything to do with your position You can sleep in any position you wantit may not make a difference in your symptoms I dont know your medical history but I feel you should have that gallbladder carefully evaluated You need to see a good foot specialista podiatrist Not only will they determine the reason for your foot pain they will also suggest shoes or shoe inserts so that you will be able to walk painfree Should you be concerned Yes if you are not able to eat without vomiting You should discuss this with the GI specialist and give your acid reflux treatment a specific timeline There are many different treatments so perhaps you need a different medication or at some point consider surgery even if it appears to be small I have removed toenails for 40 years and my patients do not need any postoperative pain medications I am not sure how your procedure was done but pain should not be an issue unless there was a good reason such as an infection It would be best to give your medical provider a call  someone who is familiar with your particular case Yes of course Vaginal dryness can be uncomfortable for both partners so it would be wise to use a sexual lubricant next time Absolutely I have dozens of teens on birth control who have never been sexually involved Hormonal regulation menstrual pain heavyfrequent periodsand even severe acne also hormonerelated are some of the medical indications to use birth control pills Teens do have birth control access even without parent permission but when it is for a medical reason and not contraception parents should be involvedand supportive Any discharge from the penis should be considered suspicious and be properly evaluated If this cloudy discharge only occurs during a bowel movement or straining constipation then one possible cause could be prostatitis  a prostate gland infection or problem You need to see your primary care medical provider or a urologist to be properly diagnosed and treated You will need to be specifically cleared by the medical provider who is treating you  the one familar with the details of your case Healing time varies from person to person so there is really no set rules for when to return to strenous activities Talk to your surgeon but it is not unusual to have some leakage of blood under the skin or subcutaneous tissue south of the surgical incision that could involve the penis or scrotal area Blame it on gravity This would look like a deep bruise It may be red af first but then turns a bluishpurple as the body reabsorbs the blood Hernias can be lifethreatening and can only be repaired surgically A person can take a strong pain medication for appendicitis but they will still have appendicitis Dont mask the painthe pain is a message that your body is sending to call your attention to the hernia that needs SURGICALLY repaired I have no way of determining what you have based solely on your brief description I do not know anything about you your age your medical history etc In order to be properly diagnosed you will need to see a medical provider  someone who can take a more detailed medical history and more importantlysomeone who can examine you Your testicles are too important to rely on a blind guess via the Internet If you are sexually involved and NOT using any form of effective birth control there is always a possibility that you could be pregnant Just having lower back pain or bloating is not a definitive sign of pregnancy and is really irrelavant if you are more concerned about the possibility of pregnancy See your medical provider so you can be properly examined and find the reason for you back pain or bloating and the very least get a pregnancy test You may have ruptured your eardrum so it would be wise to see your medical provider It is not a true emergency but it would be good to be seen today or in the next two daysThis is really the only way to determine the extent of the damage With that said most traumatic ruptures of the eardrum will heal over time but you need to give up this unnecessary habit of using Qtips One in 12 men have a varicoceles and nearly all of them are painless Surgery is rarely needed unless there is a change in the size smaller of one or both of your testicles if your fertility has been affected or if a particularly large varicocele is causing discomfort A urologist should be consulted for a consultation If you do not use tobacco tongue cancer would certainly be lesslikely If you had this same lesion unchanged for ten years then this would not be consisent with a malignant oral lesion The reason why your doctors are biopsing this lesion is to find out what it is Soon you will have that definitive answer and also will no longer have this lesion to worry about Yesas a matter of fact my wife just had dental work today and she is on Advil and amoxicillin They are compatible That punch may have ruptured your eardrum This is just a guess however since I cant examine you Most traumatic ruptures assuming this is what happened will heal in a few weeks and hearing will return to normal levels It is unfortunate that you have to wait for an appointmentyou really need to see an ENT now There are more things that can cause neckback pain than scoliosis so I would suggest that you see a medical provider orthopedist for a consultation and higherlevel examination Neck pain is usually NOT solely related to scoliosis Having a comfortable bed is always good no matter what the reason for you back pain but you would have to try various mattresses and pillows to find the best combination for you What works for one person will not likely work for another If the blood was bright red then it is likely from a hemorrhoid or fissure Darker olderlooking blood can be from higher up in the intestinal tract and black tarry blood is usually from the stomach Dont panic There is a good chance that this is an innocent finding but you will need to be examined to determine the exact source of the blood In four days the edges of a repair laceration should be closing and not draining certainly not red and painful You may have a secondary wound infection and of course this could be keeping the wound from properly healing You may need antibiotics Dehiscence is certainly possible This wound needs to be checked and if possible but the person who sutured you You did not get gonorrhea from being touched by someones finger or rimmed You got gonorrhea from having sex anal andor vaginal with a guy that had gonorrhea and passed it to you because you did not insist on him using a condom You are not practicing safe sex so this may be the first of many serious health consequences you will be experiencing Your HIV and other STD tests may have been negative this time but unless you get smart and start protecting yourself it is only a matter of time before you will be exposed to something more difficult to treat than gonorrhea We have a saying in medicine Gone is Good Now that your pain has completely resolved it is debatable whether a handson medical visit would reveal the true cause It is really up to you whether to seek care or not You see your medical provider so that you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated Your kidney pain may or may not be related to your recently heatrelated event I dont know what thing you are talking about Was it an instrument to clean out earwax and other debris or was it just the funnellike tip of the otoscope the instrument with the light If your ears hurt during the examand still hurts the clinician most likely scratched or abraided the very sensitive lining of the ear canal You may need some antibiotic drops so CALL this person tell him the story and have him call in a prescription for you No sense in you paying for another visit unless he plans on doing it for free I used have that after my teeth whiting for about 1mth but my sensitivity is still here after a year do not whiten teeth not worth the pain its like needles going into every tooth I would cry with pain I used to be like that I bought ultimate flora 50 billion critical probiotic at vitamin shop its wonderful I would imagine so if the brain were developed enough to process it It would depend a lot on age and how old the fetus was That is indeed interesting do you have some kind of association with an injury you sustained while seeing people standing on hard surfaces Or is it associated perhaps with any sort of tension or anxiety I wish you the best in finding that answer The human mind is wonderful and odd indeed Along with OBGYN approved pain relievers a humidifier or a long hot shower may give her some relieve A saline rinse can help too as well as a salt water gargle Plenty of fluids and plenty of rest It can happen if your muscles are weak or the joints in your ribs are loose Ive seen it happen and it usally pops back into place on its own You might want to try core strengthening exercises if you are in shape for it My son is biracial and his dr said that its just his tyroid gland that its ok that they are swollenjust as long as there is no painHe said that alot of boys get it Thank you so much for the response i have an appointment with my gynecologist and will know whats wrong with me In the interim the bleeding has now stopped and its been a week this far I HAD THAT TOO ENDED UP HAVING A HYSTERECTOMY NEVER FELT BETTER To help ease the pain untill next month use orajel on the tooth or if you prefer natural use clove oil which contains properties that will help ease the pain She may have internal bleeding in the brain do not give her anything for it it can only cause the bleeding to get worse Get her to the doctor to

sexual pain disorders can wreak havoc in a mans life This is because there is a constant and nagging uncomfortable feeling about having sex This is because the very thought of sex is frustrating and dreaded due to the pain that is constantly felt in the genital region Male sexual pain disorders can be a real pain in both senses of the word and brings him nothing but fear and discomfort overall What is Dyspareunia Dyspareunia is a constant and nagging pain that is present in the genital areas of males and females This pain is always right along with sexual intercourse either right before intercourse or after the intercourse has been done The pain is said to be something that can be psychological in nature in some instances this is why it is a medical condition that does indeed require a lot of investigation into from the onset What are sexual pain disorders Sexual pain disorders are characterized by different things Some of these different things do include have feelings of extreme pain during the act of sexual intercourse Nonetheless the pain that is felt with this disorder is not just about sexual intercourse The pain can occur with any kind of stimulation that is done to the sexual genitals in nature This genital stimulation is something that doesnt have to be sexual in detail as well in addition A lot of these disorders do mainly happen to women but they also occur in men but not as much as in women it is apparent What are the causes of sexual pain disorders Sexual pain disorders are something that cannot be diagnosed This is because they do occur for various reasons What are some of these various reasons The answer to this question is that it could have originated directly from a biological condition or some form of disease Sexual pain disorders are thought to be psychological in nature not physical a good deal of the time This is the reason that a diagnosis is not made It is usually not connected to anything that is physical in description with most patients who suffer from it What are the treatments for sexual pain disorders Both physical and psychological therapy treatments are usually both the avenues to go for those who do suffer from sexual pain disorders Treatment does usually start off with a very frank and open discussion with a medical professional who does know all about this disorder There is a specific group of muscles ligaments and tissues that are responsible for supporting the internal organs that can be examined closely when trying to assess the exact cause of the pain that is being felt How common are sexual pain disorders Sexual pain disorders are something that do happen mainly to women The average number of women that can get these kind of sexual pain disorders is between 3 and 18 However men do get it even if comes in at much lesser averages than those of women Please do note that this constant pain is not just limited to sexual intercourse It can be with any kind of physical contact or stimulation of the genitals It also doesnt have to be sexual in nature either The pain comes just from coming in touch with the genitals in any kind of way that is stimulating overall Conclusion The best way to deal with male sexual pain disorders is very apparent You have to get some help for them There is no other answer other than this one Therefore do get help for your male sexual pain disorders if only to make your sexual health and sexual life a little more easier to like and accept overall Sexual pain disorder is indeed painful but the worst part comes along with being frustrated about it and this can only intensity the condition all the more No one wants to be made to feel pain especially when it comes to sex but somehow this pain just happens and a lot of the times it cannot be explained as to why it does happen This can only add fuel to the flame of the problem and make a patient feel totally fearful about even thinking about having sex in general with anyone My tests were normal also kept having pains then gallstones showed up on a sonogram had gallbladder removed the next day if you get a persistent or painful erection which is called priapism you need to be seen right away Believe it or not its common enough that everyone in the ER will have seen it theyll get you in the doctors will first try to ice you up hoping that they can chill it Sometimes you can even squeeze the blood out and the erection will fade and thats actually a good sign though it can be horribly painful There are these phasodilators medications that will allow the blood vessels to expand to allow the blood to leave they can have you inhale those and sometimes that works If that doesnt work and the other techniques dont work then usually the urologist will have to go in and actually extract the old thick blood causing the erection to go away and sometimes put in some fresh fluids to try to get the old sludging fluid to leave We numb up the skin put in a needle and basically aspirate out pull out the old thick blood thats no longer oxygenated its just static and getting old And that allows the erection to fade and usually in a very short time men have resolution of the pain The great thing about it is the sooner you act the better your chance for a normal sex life in the future If you wait and Ive seen some men that wait for 24 hours then your risk for complications permanent scarring permanent damage go way up The problem with erections is that its supposed to be for most men mostly a sexual response The blood flows in more than the blood flows out chambers fill up you get an erection If the erection lasts too long the blood in there is not changing it starts to become old and it can become very very painful and it becomes a true emergency So an erection that does not fade away after a couple of hours or if it becomes painful you need to go to the emergency room Now guys arent going to want to do that O walk in with this great erection to say I have this horrible erection its been here for six hours But the longer they wait the more likely of having permanent problems SL What are the permanent problems Permanent problems would be inability to ever get an erection again Or severe scarring Cutting off the blood supply you get scarring irritation inflammation and that continues long after the priapism has resolved Plus if you wait too long and we have to become aggressive with interventions sticking needles in that leads to scarring and leaking as well internally If you have a persistent erection that does not resolve when it should if it becomes painful that becomes an emergency and should be seen And if you delay if you think it might go away 3 or 4 or 5 hours later and it doesnt then youre increasing your risk of having a permanent erection disorder So call your doctor go to the emergency room have it addressed right away Blood in the semen is not a problem unless it is heavy and prolonged over time It can come and go and be anywhere from bright red to dark old blood to brownish to spotty It is scary that is a fact But it is not a problem that means anything about fertility or cancer If you are still worried then see a urologist get an exam a PSA and a urine check You have had a penile fracture and there is a significant chance you will develop scarring and curvature at that point For men with fresh penile fracture we tell them no sex of any kind for 2 to 3 weeks at a minimum You should see a urologist soon For severe fractures with severe pain swelling and extensive bruising we often fix those surgically if we see the man right after it happens If there is a delay or it is not severe we often manage conservatively So obviously this is a while later and I hope that you have seen your doctor and had your urine checked for infetcion Chills associated with infections usually means a severe infection usually with buring blood in urine pain urgency to pee having to urinate very frequently weak stream etc My guess is from what you said it was just the environment or somehting else but each person is different and for one person may be severe symptoms others may have minimal symptoms of same infection  it will get worse if you stop having sexi know exactly what it is and its awful as we age we loose our estrogen we can use creams with an estrogen in it but the side effects are pretty bad i no longer have sex  not by choice my partner has ED and will not get help for it so  i am celebrate and i hate it when we were having sex it was a lot better if you dont use it you will loose it What are you doing for exercise and stretching A lot of times back pain is caused by poor posture but also if you dont work your back on pulling exercises then if wont want to support itself There are many sideeffects that painkillers can have on women in particular and people in general In women before or after menopause narcotics can cause addiction issues or sideeffects such as sweating elation followed by depression nausea with or without vomiting headache dizziness confusion and drowsiness Less commonly they can cause excitement and insomnia instead NSAIDs can cause easier bleeding and stomach issues and sometimes lung inflammation they can cause allergic reactions all medications can cause those but of OTC painkillers NSAIDs cause more and they were the first OTC medications to carry anaphylaxis warning labels due to this I myself was nearly killed by an NSAID allergy Lyrica pregabalin commonly used for fibromyalgia which is more common in women can cause addiction issues or sideeffects such as weight gain edema retention of water in hands and feet and even ankles drowsiness clumsiness dizziness wordfinding speech issues wild mood swings including with rage episodes or suicidal thoughts and actions fainting and feeling chilly Check with your pharmacist regarding concerns about sideeffects If any medication causes rapid swelling of the tongue lips or throat hives or redness of the skin difficulty breathing or other severe allergic symptoms call 911 and go to an emergency department immediately True anaphylactic shock is fatal if untreated Sometimes it can in fact especially in women pain in the shoulder area rather than the chest isnt uncommon during a heart attack Check with your cardiologist If you have a known heart disease and experience sudden pain in the chest shoulder left arm and other sudden symptoms such as difficulty breathing or faintingcollapse call 911 and go to an emergency department immediately You need to get prompt medical attention for this Bloody urine hematuria is not ever normal and though passing a kidney stone can cause it I know from experience so can incipient kidney failure If you have pyelonephritis kidney infection you require antibiotic treatment Sounds like a canker sore and theyre awful but not serious OTC preparations are sold that can be brushed on these sores for temporary pain relief they usually go away in 7 to 10 days Check with your dentist to see if your mouth has the proper pH balance Sometimes you get so used to a drugpill that it starts to not work anymore it might mean that you should try a different pain reliever but it doesnt hurt to get it checked out just incase Your shoulder muscles could just be cramping up but you could also get it checked out It sounds to me like it is muscular skeletal But there are a number of conditions that could cause those type pains One could be related to a spinal condition but it could also be arthritic changes or Fibromyalgia You probably should see someone who will evaluate you for these issues Probably a Dr Who specializes in rheumatism or orthopedic conditions Tell your physician about it and he can send you to the right specialist  You should go back to your doctor because there are quite a number of reasons why your symptoms may have not be alleviated such as the cause of your sinus infection may have not been bacterial rather viral therefore antibiotics were futile to the infection and so on Sounds like low potasium pills should help but if pain gets to bad drinking a bottle of tonic water will take pain away almost instantly Do you have a history of ulcers Sounds like classic ulcerative conditions You should try not drinking coffee or smoking both of which can aggravate the pain You may also need to see a gastric specialist It is not determined what may be causing this It is very rarely that you may have a Intestinal Corruption and or  rip in intestines  but you would be puking and bleeding out mouth Please see a physcian as soon as possible as this may be a serious condition and or  ordeal  You may be eating certain things that could cause this Spicy or hot foods are more likely all the time going to give you heart burn  and BBQ such as meats and sauces Although this may be something more serious  Possibly may be Heart Disease or a sign of a Heart Attack Please consult your Physcian for a correct diagnosis as I am not the most smartest person in the world  Yes I suffer from chronic infections Find a good urologist He She can run tests and figure out what is going on They will come up with a treatment plan to fit your needs and determine the reason you are getting UTIs and how to best treat it Ok you need to go to the doctor asap It could be caused by a number of intestinal problems 2yrs ago my mother was diagnosed with colon cancer She described it as a period out of her butt I doubt it would be that But it is very important You dont want to wait when it comes to bloody stool Dont panic or anything but it needs to be seen about I suffer from many back problems myself I know it seems extreme but talk to your neurologist and see if there are other options for pain management I personally see a pain specialist but there are other forms of treatment Make sure to research and fully understand any treatment before taking it Also try taking Motrin It is an anti inflammatory and can reduce pressure and pain The best thing would be to seek a urologist They can run tests to determine what is going on That is a high protein count and my first thought is infection especially since I have chronic infections But see a specialist not only for a second opinion but because they know much more about urinary and testicular problems My advice would be a change in diet and if this has been going on for awhile like more than 36 hours to see a doctor In could be a lot of minor or even serious problems with your stomach All of the symptoms you are experiencing are signs of infection and are a real emergency that can get worse I would get to a dentist as soon as possible These types of infections can be quite painful and end up with a hospitalization or worse It sounds like there may be some abnormal sensitivity to cold This can be a reversible situation that responds well to desensitizing toothpastes like Sensodyne or prescriptionstrength fluoride treatments done at home However it may also be an irreversible pulpitis situation in one or more of the teeth that could require root canal Either way your dentist needs to check out the problem and may need to take Xrays to be sure Bottom line Make an appointment to see the dentist Delay will only allow more damage to occur If you are experiencing pain there may already be a problem with a nerve or you may be getting close to losing the tooth You may just make things worse by waiting The cause of your pain may be a cavity a cracked tooth or receding gums Please see your dentist for a diagnosis because that shouldnt be ignored This is really nice to know that you recently quit smoking Further to your question about the pain you are suffering from i do like to tell that these are the withdrawal symptoms of smoking As your body and brain is addicted to smoking for a long time and is carving for the same As a result of this you are facing such

gallbladder I had severe pain for 26 hours I was referred to a clinic for an ultrasound The results showed that I had gallstones Hum If the pain is also coupled by light sensitivity and redness  as crazy as this may sound  it may be related to that inflammation from an IBS condition If you arent an IBS sufferer then another possibility is a scratched cornea Below please find a study from Harvard that does not agree with the answer above Go see a specialist sounds serious to me your blood glucose levels are bouncing around better safe than sorry I was on Effexor for quite a while and found it very effective However when I started to have problems with muscles and achesnot knowing that I was probably dealing with FibromyalgiaI switched to Cymbalta I have found it to be helpful with the aches Your pain sounds like you may be having problems with your sciaticaa nerve that runs from your lower back down through your buttand then down the leg It can be very painful I have had spinal injections that have been helpful and for a brief time participated in a pain management program Sometimes it is hard to figure what comes first the chronic pain or the depression I will say that effective pain management does allow me to focus more on dealing with the depression Talk with your doctor about developing a plan that can try to address both issues Best Wishes to you I would talk to my doctor about liver or gall bladder issues Try to notice if you become more uncomfortable after a meal If you have a history of alcohol consumption it could be issues with your liver You do not mention if the pain is severe or not Liver can also be affected by long term use of tylenol and other medications Do go to your doctor do not let this just ride until it becomes something serious Upper GI tract issues can also cause pain in the area that you describe When a patient responds by forming keloid scars there is a greater than average chance that this will continue to occur I assume that as you mention she has been given treatments that included shots she has access to a physician who can help you make an appropriate decision in this regard Surgery is not as good an option for your wife but you should discuss both microdermabrasion and laser resurfacing with your wifes doctor Both are better alternatives and work by focusing on the overdevelopment of collagen that is the key problem with keloid scarring The type of pain you describe is not typical for a standard blister It does sound possible that you have either gotten an infection or you are experiencing nerve pain from the site of the blister that is moving up your leg Wear shoes that do not irritate the blister Keep the area clean and dry Take ibuprofen for pain if necessary If this does not clear up in a day or two or if you see obvious signs of serious infection such as swelling hot inflamed skin overall fever please see your PCP Im very sorry to hear about your recent shingles infection This is a very painful condition because the pain runs along your nerves resulting in postherpetic neuralgia nerve pain that can last for quite some time after your shingles infection is gone How it will affect your fibromyalgia is not an easy answer Pain is debilitating and having fibromyalgia puts you in a position of further debilitation from the shingles pain I recommend going back to your doctor prior to the end of your vicodin prescription for a very frank discussion of the pain and what it means to you Your dermatologist should evaluate skin changes or abnormal spots A lesion that feels hard may be scar tissue However you should be evaluated for any underlying skin cancer When evaluating your skin look for changes in the area border or color of the skin These are the ABCs of skin cancer detection Ticks can carry Lyme disease which can cause major medical problems I would take himher in for testing You should still have her seen by a doctor Especially if you do not know what type of tick it is Do you know if it left a bull eye mark They can treat with antibiotic as a preventative if caught soon enough I would call your Dr There are very good chances that you can get pregnant but there is no accurate confirmation till you miss your period so good luck to you if you are looking forward to get pregnant then I hope its a good news  As far as your nipples hurting and breast getting tender can happen without being pregnant too before u get your period hormones levels go up and it makes breast lil fuller and tender Wow nobody mentioned Hemothorax No I have not had unprotected sex ever Yes they can STRAIN OR HERNIATED DISC I WOULD DEFINITELY GET AN MRI OR SCAN SOON I think youre pretty lucky I have a condition called fibromyalgia and all I feel is pain all the time all over my body different kinds of pains its horrible so honestly maybe its a blessing maybe something happens later in your life that your now prepared for also you can think of yourself as a superhero because you can do things other people cant Also your problem could be short term trauma to spinal cord but only took out pain receptors Unfortunately with any kind of trauma its always undetermined heal time because each one is different so that means it could be a day or 50 years I think if you feel good exercise your entire body like bike riding and it may come back on its on Try and enjoy no pain I wish I couldnt feel emotional painlol probably should have started with all the last stuff huh Sorry about that Good luck and enjoy life First call your doctor and make an appointment right away I had bleeding my first month and I didnt know I was pregnant While your waiting for appointment you could get another pregnacy testIf the test is negative it is very common for women to have a miscarriage on first try especially if having trouble conceiving Also if you were on birth control it could take longer It took me three and a half years after being on the pill for thirteen years Also try not to stress usually most women are successful the second time with no issues This all depends on your health and genetics Good luck and my prayers are with you I have had the same symptoms I have no galbladder The doctor done a ultrasound told me I have a fatty liver Hi I have Rheumatoid Arthritus I feel that way all the time and also feel an achyness all the time But I think you should go see a Rheumatologist and he can tell weather you have Osteoarthritus or RA Or even if your doctor does xrays and blood tests they can tell I hope you get better soon Tamara Try using mineral oil you should go to the Dr it sounds like you could have blood clots Hello about 3 yrs ago I started to get weak then started to get tired all the time Also I started having chills like the flu So I went to my doctor and he sent me directly to the emergency room They said after I got seen that I had Pneumonia hopefully you dont have it Had to stay in hosptital a wk Thanks for your repsonse it did help The 2 pills I do a month last me all month I dont do a whole dose I just do a little bit each day So I stretch the 2 just enough so I have a little each day for all month I have slowed down a lot I have been trying to wein myself all of them but now I found out Im pregnant I am def going to have to do something I have just been trying this whole time to avoid telling doctors or family members But I know I am going to have to just suck it up and tell my doctor hopefully shell be able to help me I think the hardest part is the mental state and when I dont have them I have NOO energy to do anything and that creepy crawly feeling you feel through your whole body But i am READY to stop I def dont want to be like this forever and I HATE that I even let myself get in this situation I have 2 other kids and I never had any problems when I was pregnant with them bc I didnt do anything like this so I def dont want to start now So again thanks for your feedback I do appreciate it No I would definitely consult a doctor immediately to get a professional opinion They have the means to perform certain tests to narrow down the options It could be a sign of PCOS google it for description It could also be a sign of something more serious Or possibly due to hormornes stress andor weight gain or loss Either way going to the OBGYN is your best choice to get the necessary medical attention I had the same problem Was hospitalized for 5 days all kinds of tests were run  everything was  normal They wanted to cut me open to look around  find out what was causing this pain I said no They wouldnt feed me  They were sure it was my intestines not I ended up going to my internist the next week She checked me out felt my trigger points  found the problem I had a frozen abdominal muscle She gave me an injection in the correct trigger point within 20 minutes all pain was gone I had severe low back pain from November 2011 until May 2012 I went to a doctor and had xrays I was put on anti inflammatories and muscle relaxants After 4 weeks and no improvement I had an MRI It revealed that I had a herniated disc on L4 with 30 of my spinal space full of disc material I tried physical therapy and while it helped I was not back to normal I had a microdiscectomy in May Good by pain hello my life back I was in the hospital for six hours I was up and walking that day One week later I could walk a mile I now lift weights hike and exercise on a regular basis Best thing I ever did for my back which was originally injured 30 years ago Normally it has to deal with your nerves if you have struck a nerve on top of your head you could have damaged it Also it could be migraines weak migraines consult with your medical care provider Have you had a pelvic exam I had ovarian cyst that caused pain on my lower right side for over a year before I went to my gyno had surgery lost my ovary as well as the pain YES I take Percocet daily and my doctor keeps a close eye on my liver count Does your doctor know you are taking pain meds and for how long The literature you receive with your meds tells you that it can cause liver damage If he wont listen I would find a new doctor I would see a Dr if I were having hematuria andor pain I would see an orthopedic specialist especially if my painful knee made a clicking or popping noise Yes also it can break your pelvis and cause skin cancer on your Penis R The first answer to this question is just absurd Surgery Really May I suggest visiting a chiropractor since they deal with bones and the reason for the pinched nerve is caused by your spine not being aligned properly I had a pinched nerve in my lower back causing severe pain in my lower back and leg Was unable to lift my leg I can move and now feeling great Of course it did take a couple of weeks at 3 visits per week I just dont understand how people would want to have someone cut into them if they dont have too Hi terribly sorry to hear about your pain I to suffer from similar pain but mine continues from the hamstrings down the outer lower leg and only occurs in one leg at a time It has been found to be caused by sciatica as I had a back injury some time back I also suggest seeing an orthopedic surgeon physician or possibly a phsyiatrist for the root cause of the pain In the mean time you could take some over the counter painkillers like Codydramol or Advil to help relieve the pain temporarily Hope your pain is relieved soon Hi sorry to hear about your pain For longterm aid you could try decreasing your meal sizes as the day progresses especially at dinner You could also try eating 34 hours before going to bed to allow your food to digest better chewing your food properly to aid with digestion and eating less processed foods For temporary relief you could try taking over the counter medicines like Gaviscon or Dica or antacids or chewing gum Hope this helps Your headaches sound like a version of posttraumatic migraine  many of the same medications used for regular migraines also work for this type of headache Talk with your regular doctor about a referral to a headache specialist There is a type of headache called occipital neuralgia that is just in the back of the head usually with severe tenderness in the back of the head Most patients with occipital neuralgia have increased pain with movement There is often a burning quality to the pain and some patients have a pins and needles sensation with the pain There is a fairly simple treatment for occipital neuralgiainjection of a local anesthetic lidocaine or novacaine into the nerve in the scalp which numbs up the back of the head and makes the pain go away Sometimes taking a medication like Aleve or Motrin every day for several days will calm this down Several things could be causing thissometimes the head position when you are on the MRI scan table puts stress on the neck causing neck pain patients have complained to me about this There are 2 nerves in the back of the head called the Greater Occipital Nerves These nerves can be compressed when your head is laying on a hard surface and cause fairly severe pain as well There are not any serious problems inside the head like brain problems that would cause this The magnetic field from the MRI scan is not strong enough to directly influence the brain or pain fibers There is a muscle in your temple that could be inflamed There are a couple of headache problems including migraine that can cause similar pain Clenching your teeth or bruxism can sometimes cause this as well If over the counter medications are not helping talk to your doctor and have them look at the swollen area Something as simple as a prescription strength antiinflammatory may help My husband got cdiff after being on flagyl and even stronger antibotics Cdiff is not anything to play around with He never had vomiting problems but he was in a lot of pain Check her temperature and if it is 101 or higher get her to a doctor ASAP May want to get her to a doctor anyway He also developed septicemia bacteria in the blood stream Almost lost him twice Not trying to scare you but need to take this very seriously More people die from this disease in the US each year than people who get killed in auto accidents And also make sure she has a good infectionous doctor Please let me know how she is doing Concerned from NC You may have sleep apnea Get to s sleeplab and they will monitor your sleeping for this and if it is not this they may can help anyway or refer to you someone who can You may have a pinched nerve from a disc problem My husband has this problem and they do cause pain Go to your doctor and ask himher for laboratory tests and an ultrasound test of your testicles If its only been a few days then you can start taking them again but if its been more than two weeks itd be best to wait for your next period Im not a doctor but I also suffer from cysts I havent been on birthcontrol in years but I know starting it back out of order can mess with your cycle and it might cause more problems for you If I was in your position I would talk to my pharmacist They should be able to tell you if its safe at this point to pick up where you left or to just wait It sounds like a hernia My dad had one a while ago Get this checked out I agree with Dhammika My kidney stone was found by doing a CT scan WITH CONTRAST You might ask your doctor about having a CT Scan to rule a kidney stone in or out Good Luck I would love to help you and Im certain many others on this forum would too It would be extremely helpful if you could have someone assist you with rewriting your question everything you have had done including surgeries and tests and all the things you have tried so far to alleviate your pain One thing I think I understood is that you had a fusion surgery in your back Is your pain at the surgical site When did you have your surgery I wish all the best for you I have been dealing with Fibromyalgia for 12 years My personality is one that wants to gogogo I dont like to miss anything But I have to say it doesnt work like that now I require frequent rests and a day that is very low stress I knew I couldnt continue to work as a nurse while I was dealing with pain and overwhelming fatigue Be good to yourself The best exercise for me is swimming which I cant do this time of year I have a great stationary bike to use in the winter Dont worry about exercise every day When you are feeling rough relax with a book or movie Anytime I have felt like I needed to keep pushing through it has only caused me more pain and agony Hang in there God Bless You It would be best to start slow Do what you can WITHOUT overdoing it When you are having pain pushing through is a bad idea For me it has caused severe fatigue Just remember you need to baby yourself a little and modify your exercises to fit your life now God Bless you taffy I have had the same problem The sleep number bed with the memory foam overlay is best Although the pillow you use may be more important You need a good one that cradles your head and is slightly raised at the neck area Sleep number can help with that too It is possible that you may have some dryness KY Jelly can be helpful I had this trouble after years of marriage Mine was related to low hormones The other possibilities could be serious such as cervical cancer in which case you need to see a Dr Hello I have been through your same problemsIt is not a comfortable situation When I had this problem I went to my Family MDFirst he did a urine testwell this was all it took to figure out that I had a very bad bladder infectionBladder infections can cause nauseaback painleakageburning when you urinateand some pelvic painIn my opinion I would go see my Drbut until you can get into the Dr I would not drink any sodasany caffinealcoholor anything with high acid  things like OJDrink Lots Of WaterBut I would go to the store and get some Cranberry Juice or in the pharmacy in the Vitamins section there is a Cranberry Pill that is a Very High Concentrated Cranberry Oilwhich helps to clean your urinary tract One of these the juice or the pills will help you out a lotJust follow the instuctions on the back of the bottle of pills or if you are going to drink the juiceI would drink 46 ounces 4 times a dayuntil you see the DrInfo from someone who has been through thisI take Cranberry Pills everyday nowI have not had as many problems with this anymore and I strated taking the pills this about 3 years ago If you do start thismake sure to talk to your Dr about it when you see him for your appointment Good Luck To YouI hope this helps you and anyone else that may read thisGod Bless Sounds like herniated disks in lower lumbar I would see a back specialist I have 2 on my lower back My leg goes numb and can hardly move sometimes I am on week 8 of physical therapy and has helped a lot I do know the ice packs is the best for inflammation I had the Mirena in for the full 5 years and I remember having the spotting which happened for a while But you are mentioning that the spotting is heavier and having small clots I think it would be wise and to just put your mind at rest that what you are experiencing is normal or needs to be looked at because of this I would suggest you call your Drs office and explain whats happening and they should get back to you either way to put your mind at rest The thing that came to my mind right away was Optic Neuritis as I had this condition last year in both eyes If your eyes hurt when your moving them go and see your local eye Dr and they will be able to confirm this by having a look at the back of your eye and it will be obvious if it is Optic Neuritis Then the next step is to see a Neuro eye Doctor who may treat the infection with IV steroids to help bring the inflammation down quicker and hopefully your eyesight can be saved But remember I am not saying you have this  it is just a suggestion and you will have to see a real Dr to rule this out Youre most likely pregnant Get a home pregnancy test I have experienced coffee ground emesis vomit It is what digested blood looks like as it has passed through the GI tract It often turns out to be an ulcer but it could also mean it could be a mass of some sort and should be dealt with immediately If you dont already have a Family Physician that can help expedite his endoscopy by calling their office and requesting that and if he is growing weak has lost weight then go to the ER again with a sample of his vomit if possible Be sure they draw his blood and check his complete blood count to look for infection and for hemoglobin He may also need a CT scan of his abdomen After 2 months they must show some pathology Insist that it is an emergency and that his endoscopy must be done STAT right now If you have to ask for the MD in charge If that doesnt work ask also for the Patient Representative It is true that the squeeky wheel does get the attention I think he has been more than patient and its time to get some answers Good luck It can detect only very recent changes in the uterus As a patient with chronic pain and as a nurse I would also recommend the use of a couple stool softeners a day as well a couple of Senna The Senna works to mechanically move the stool after it has been softened Push fluids and try to stay as active as your pain allowsEat fresh fruit and food with high fiber As long as you are using pain meds you might have to just get used to taking a stool softener or two daily Once your bowels have started to move then you wont need the Senna so much Good luck Definitely do get on top of this issue as it is not good for you to have to strain to move your bowels It raises your blood pressure puts pressure on your heart as well as leads to hemorrhoids As a patient and a nurse with a long history of back pain from degenerative disc disease and other pathology I have had similar pain Since your pain is unrelated to a sudden onset from an injury or strain then you might want to explore possible kidney concerns If your urine is foul smelling than it can very easily be a that may have been caused from an untreated or from I would get to a clinic or urgent care center get a urine culture and an xray or ultra sound looking for stones There are also other conditions that need to be ruled out a well Good luck THANKS I HAVE BEEN HAVING A CHEST PAIN AND THRU MY UNDERARM SINCE EARLY THIS MORNING I AM SCARED IT COULD BE A HEART ATTACK THEN AGAIN I HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS PAIN BEFORE BUT DOES NOT LAST AS LONG AS IT HAS TODAYIT GETS WORSE WHEN I LAY DOWNCOULD IT BE GAS OR SHOULD I GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM I have anxiety as well Sometimes things like that can cause emotional damage that will bring on anxiety it may never go away When I had anxiety attacks I would shake heart rate would go up hearing would decrease and I would feel like I couldnt breathe It would take me awhile to calm myself down I started going to a counsler and a thereapist  I was put on medication Sometimes just having someone to talk to can really help you I eventually took myself off of the medication about 2 years ago But i just had my daughter in november  that has brought them back again I am now on paxil for anxiety Maybe try going to talk to someone or try a medication that is made for anxiety Sometimes those things can really improve it I have had the same problem for approx 2 months Eye exam came back clear I did find out i am far sighted and was prescribed reading glasses My eye pains are accompanied by headaches mainly to the left side of my head i only sleep on my left side so maybe the weight of my head affects the relevant nerves to my temple and eye I was worried about optic neuritis because it is often a classic symptom of multiple sclerosis and quite a few people tend to go on and develop MS within 10 yrs of having their first bout of ON  classic symptoms of ON loss of vision colour perception changes inflamed back of eye upon eye examination  last week i had a head brain and spinal MRI all of which came back clear So eye nerves not involved I was so worked up about possibility of MS But as soon as it was all clear most of my symptoms went away Eye pain has greatly diminished too Based on GPs advice although he cant say definitively what is causing this pain it could be dehydration are you drinking enough water lower your caffeinealcohol intake as they are diuretics stress i am going through an incredibly stressful period so am accepting it could very well be a psychosomatic symptom migraine andor ice pick headaches cause the stabbing eye pains sinuses have you tried sinus tabletssprays to see if that helps eye strain so very common esp if you work on a computer for many hours at a time Eye pain could also be a sign of arthritis esp rheumatoid arthritis  do you have any other aches and pains Have a full blood count and ask to check your antibodies to rhuematoid arthritis and lupus Its probably something benign causing the pains But they are irritating i know For me ive put it down to dehydration eye strain currently studying and stress  i find when i chill out and relax my symptoms diminish if not completely disappear Hopefully your symptoms have imporved since your post I dont know what preview means but basically it means you have trapped gas or a disease so go strait to the ER emergency room or grab you iPad and go sit up on that toilet And watch out for cats Sorry I dont know how to help you Most doctors would suggest home remedies for external hemorrhoids somewhere along the lines of your question There is a suggestion to use a small string rather than a rubber band Almost like a turniqete you tie the string around it not too tight but not too lose To cut blood flow off to it no common symptoms Most people with this \t\t\t condition have that may spread outward to the arms back neck or \t\t\t jaw This pain can feel similar to a \t\t\t  If you have chest pain you should be \t\t\t evaluated by a doctor as soon as possible to rule out or treat cardiac disease It seems it can very easily be related but can also be a

are especially good for joint pain caused by an arthritis flare You might also try using a local spray such as fluoromethane nonflammable on your back or painful area before and after exercise This superficial cooling decreases muscle spasms and increases the threshold of pain Or you can make instant cold packs from frozen bags of vegetables Some patients prefer cold therapy to moist heat for arthritis pain while others tell of having the best relief when they alternate the sessions with moist heat and ice You can experiment with moist heat and ice therapy and then select the method that gives the best relief with the least trouble or expense Many women believe that avoiding intercourse and giving their vagina a rest is the best antidote to painful sex Experts say the exact opposite is true There is some measure of truth to the axiom that if you dont use it you lose it says womens health expert Christiane Northrup MD Northrup is the author of Womens Bodies Womens Wisdom  Stop having sex she says and resuming it may be that much harder  both physically and in terms of desire At the same time she says pain with intercourse is not normal It often occurs when your partner simply isnt arousing you enough In other instances hormonally driven vaginal dryness  like the vaginal dryness some women feel when nursing a baby or going through menopause  can also cause sexual discomfort A little dollop of a lubricating product or an estrogen cream applied directly to the vagina Northrup says is all you need to eliminate discomfort from painful intercourse related to hormones If arousal is the problem Northrup says talk to your partner about increasing foreplay Then do whatever it takes to get you through the excitement phase and make your body ready for intercourse Root canal procedures have the reputation of being painful Actually most people report that the procedure itself is no more painful than having a filling placed Most pain comes from tissue damage The pain stems from an injury to the bodys tissues The injury can be to bone soft tissue or organs The injury to body tissue can come from a disease such as cancer Or it can come from physical injury such as a cut or a broken bone The pain you experience may be an ache a sharp stabbing or a throbbing It could come and go or it could be constant You may feel the pain worsen when you move or laugh Sometimes breathing deeply can intensify it Pain from tissue damage can be acute For example sports injuries like a sprained ankle or turf toe are often the result of damage to soft tissue Or it can be chronic such as arthritis or chronic headaches And certain medical treatments such as radiation for cancer can also cause tissue damage that results in pain Anyone who has nerve pain should get a full physical examination done by a doctor Get checked for diabetes high cholesterol and blood pressure Get evaluated for recent viral illnesses and toxins to which you may have been exposed Discuss your full family medical history with the doctor Medical therapies are available to treat unexplained nerve pain and its worthwhile to discuss them with your doctor But while medications can help they usually cant reduce more than half of the pain These are some of the conditions that are most likely to cause hip pain Arthritis  Arthritic conditions such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis are among the most common causes of hip pain especially in older adults Arthritis leads to inflammation of the hip joint and the breakdown of the cartilage that normally cushions your hip bones The pain gradually gets worse as the arthritis progresses People with arthritis also feel stiffness and have reduced range of motion in the hip Hip fractures  Fractures of the hip are a particular problem in elderly people With age the bones can become weak and brittle Weakened bones are more likely to fracture during a fall Bursitis  Inflammation of the small fluidfilled sacs called bursae that protect muscles and tendons is usually due to repetitive activities that overwork or irritate the hip joint Tendinitis  Tendons are the thick bands of tissue that attach bones to muscles Tendinitis is inflammation or irritation of the tendons Its usually caused by repetitive stress from overuse Muscle or tendon strain  Repeated activities can put strain on the muscles tendons and ligaments that support the hips When these structures become inflamed from overuse they can cause pain and prevent the hip from functioning normally Cancers  Tumors that start in the bone bone cancer or that spread to the bone can cause pain in the hips as well as in other bones of the body Avascular necrosis also called osteonecrosis  This condition occurs when blood flow to the hip bone is reduced and the bone tissue dies as a result Although it can affect other bones avascular necrosis most often occurs in the hip It can be caused by a hip fracture or dislocation or from the longterm use of highdose steroids such as prednisone among other causes If you have a bowel control problem medicine may helpDoctor may suggest you using laxatives to help you make more solid stools that are easier to control Doctor may also suggest antidiarrheal medicines that slow down your bowelsPlease avoid eating in restaurants and Social events I have been taking something called OmegaBerry fora few years now and have been off of morphine and Oxicodone for every since after taking together for awhile My pain level has been reduced dramatically and I started with something called HA Joint and as long as I dont do any heavy lifting im virtually pain free Also an added benefit is my cardiologist said I no longer have a heart problem but totally stable just a change of pressure I agree possibly I dont know

past injuries Most big problems start of as small problems that you dont address Treat back pain as a symptom of dysfunction not a cause The cause of back pain is rarely at the site of the pain Most people have slight postural imperfections which end up causing pain in other parts of their body Postural imperfections are magnified by such things as slouching over the computer holding the phone

httpwwwelswickchiropracticcom A typical chiropractic clinic or center offers services that care for patients experiencing pain or discomfort in musculoskeletal regions namely the back neck head arms

it at the same time Be sure you discuss any medications including over the counter meds like multivitamins and painkillers or other medical conditions with your physician Throwing a new medication or supplement can potentially cause side effects or even inhibit the effectiveness of medications youre currently taking If you have an interest in doing so another option is to consume foods either lactose free soy milk or specially made for lactose intolerant consumers such as Lacteeze Lacteeze is advantageous because you still get high levels of calcium while avoiding lactose Soy milk is a viable alternative but has much less calcium than either dairy milk rice milk or almond milk Or you could have regular dairy milk with lactase enzymes What is the pain like Is it consistent or does it

training under a chiropractor I worked in this area quite a bit The area that you are referring to is essentially the tail bone region so it makes sense that you would be having the sensation of rubbing in your hip bones Depending on where you live I would look for a massage therapist who is board certified you can gogle the American Medical Massage Association for a list of people who have passed the exam or you can always contact a reputable chiropractor If all else fails feel free to reach out to the Blue Heron Academy in Grand Rapids Michigan where they have a large referral database

places and almost severed Sometimes I have sharp pains like your having My Dr said it was from my nerves reconnecting That is what i would say if you have nerve damage You could be dehydrated or it could be a problem with your appendix alot of women continue to get these growing pains untill they are about 25 Could be scoliodis Went to the ER with similar pain all tests came back negative except CT scan with dye I ended up with CHF  fluid around the heart and fluid in the lungs all this time I thought this was stress because my husband has been dealing with side effects from Septic Shock This was my fourth trip to the ER so dont give up if you feel there is something not right keep having them check you out I have had this problem myself Not being an expert I would say the blood is caused from some tearing from having hard or large stools I have had a problem with constipation my entire life starting as a child I wouldnt go because I knew it would hurt  the longer I went without going the worse of course it got I have found that taking a stool softener capsule every night has helped immensely I just buy the genericstore brand type 100mg capsules of Docusate Sodium  I take two every night If you experienced more bleeding than what you say I wouldnt suggest this but I would venture to say this will help you based on my own experiences Alsodrink a lot of water It will help tremendously I hope I have been some help Good luck to you im not an expert or anything but it could have something to do with the sinuses I had the same experience as you had I wasnt lifting weights but mowing the lawn I went to a chiropractor first and he diagnosed me correctly I had a herniated disc in my lower back that was pinching my sciatic nerve I was in such pain that I had to go see a doctor If the pain had been less the chiropractor could have treated me but it takes longer Yikes I wouldnt lift until you know what is wrong Hope this helps This sounds like an impacted colon Have you had a colonoscopy If not I suggest you see a gastroenterologist as soon as possible I ask your doctor to do a ct scan of your stomach You want to make shore the inside and the outside of the stomach is good pain began after i sneezed hard while in a uncomfortable position Its my understanding that a doctor would prescribe you pain medication I did find this article on Home Remedies  it

nails literally fell off BUT they grew back and there were no long lasting issues I let them fall off themselves and didnt pick at them so they didnt get bloody or anything like that I would definitely go see a doctor There are so many things that this could be based on your age your normal cycle etc but the bottom line is you havent had your period in over two months If it was me Id want to understand medically what that is all about I dont know a lot about testicular pain  but I found an article that might be helpful Sounds like if its been going on for 2 years off and on you might want to get it checked out httpwwwemedicinehealthcomtesticularpainpage2emhtmtesticularpaincauses i really hope this helps If your doctor is talking about a hysterectomy it may be because hes concerned that you are at risk for something more serious I would get a second opinion because it is a big deal and you are very young however I would not wait and I would not let this go just because you arent in a lot of pain I know sometimes its easy to put things off because life gets in the way but I would not put this off I hope this helps If you really think it could be serious you must go to the doctor However when I have anxiety or have a panic attack it feels sort of like you described I would talk to your loved ones and consider going to a doctor I hope you feel better From what Ive read symptoms include lower back pain stomach pain and vomiting Most people with gallstones do not have symptoms Gallstones most frequently make their presence known when they become lodged in one of the ducts that carry bile a digestive juice from the liver to the small intestine When such an obstruction occurs you might experience the following Severe and sudden pain in the upper right abdomen and possibly extending to the upper back Fever and shivering Severe nausea and vomiting Jaundice yellowing of the skin or eyes Clay colored stools or dark urine And here is an article httpwwwwebmdcomdigestivedisordersunderstandinggallstonessymptoms I hope you feel better Not sure if this is helpful or not but I have a friend who has GERD and this is a symptom he has I found this link that goes into more detail  but you might consider what you are eating while you are trying to figure out what this might be httpwwwwebmdcomheartburngerdguideunderstandinggerdsymptoms Paleolithic men and women did not have sprung bedframes cushioned easy chairs soft mattresses or pillows Many people around the world still do not have them either What damage are we doing to our bodies structurally and otherwise when we sleep and sit on modern furniture and is it realistic to think that returning to hard surfaces could reverse some of the damage done I am thinking of possibly throwing out my bed or at the very least trying to sleep on the floor I have scoliosis and my husband has back problems and I have read evidence which says the floor is the way to go but sometimes I think I am being slightly crazy wanting to do this httpwwwwebmdcomparentingbabytcpostpartumfirst6weeksafterchildbirthrecoveryathome especially in the arms neck \t\t\t\tor jaw are common after childbirth This is because of the hard work of labor The soreness should go away in a few days I found this really cool article about what to expect after a cesarean too  httpwwwwebmdcombabytccesareansectionwhattoexpectaftercsection Well my ears turn bright red when I drink alcohol Also when there is a change in temperature  like going from outside to inside in winter Ive also heard that some medications might cause you to appear flushed but thats never happened to me personally I know this must be really scary The tact I usually take in these situations is that I try not to let my imagination run wild and not think the worst I am so glad that he is going to the doctor I did see this article on Crohns Disease Thought it might be helpful if he had more of these sorts of symptoms httpwwwwebmdcomibdcrohnsdiseasecrohnsdiseasetccrohnsdiseasesymptoms I wish you all the best I received an anterior hip replacement in July 2012 and have PT 3 times a week I find that if I miss my PT my hip starts hurting again but as long as Im using it it feels really good If the replacement is in place I wonder if its muscular or if you need more PT deep tissue work I really hope it gets better soon I would talk to my gynecologist if its that much blood at first I was thinking lubricant or maybe mild trauma getting overly vigorous but if its a showstopper then thats another story I had a hip replaced and was on a drug to prevent blood clotting That was something I was told to watch out for I would call my doctor First I will say that you should consult your doctor However soaking your feet in epson salt might help you I JUST FOUND OUT ALSO HAVE ARTHRITIS OF THE SPINE IVE BEEN DEALING WITH AWFUL LEG PAIN  SINCE FEB 2013 THOUGHT T WAS SAITIC NERVE TRIED EVERYTHING CHIROPRACTORMASSAGES PHYSICL THERAPYNOTHING HELPEDMY DRHAD ME GET XRAYS OF SPINENOW I KNOW ON MEDICNE REALLY HELPS IM 66YRS OLD LOVE DOING YARD WORK JUST NEED TO TAKE MY TIME NOW any other symptoms you could have a pinched nerve or carpal tunnel syndrome or possible another form of arthritis I had the same thing and I was diagnosed w RA if it was me I would go to your doc  tell all the symptoms  get things checked out good luck try using Listerine and gargle with it for as long as you can stand it will burn but it will also heal any sores in your mouth or throat repeat 2 or 3 times a day the sores will be gone in no time can be followed by cold h2o to cool painful sores is it right side  if so you should get to a doctor could be appendix is bad yes pain can def cause a rise in blood pressure I was told by my RA docs nurse that the more pain will cause more stress that leads to a higher blood pressure Yesif it is something simple greatbut if it is the beginning of something more serious earlier intervention will save you stress and her suffering Ive had the same pain that you described  I went to my optician over this discomfort  Id recently been diagnosed with Temporal Arteritis and was very concerned  My Dr felt that my pain was caused by Trigeminal neuralgia He said I should be fine and that sometimes middleaged and elderly people sometimes get this condition With Temporal Arteritis theres a danger of going blind so I felt relieved by this diagnosis If you have insurance you need to have your doctor order a MRI Insurance needs to approve these due to how expensive MRIs are You may have a herniation a slipped disc or it could just be muscle spasm If over the counter pain relievers do not help you may need a painkiller or a muscle relaxer If you have no insurance go to the ER and get help There are emergency payment aids for people with no insurance I hope this helped I just saw the second half of your post sorry Go to the ER If you have no insurance there are emergency payment aids that would cost you nothing You may not get an MRI done but it sounds to me like muscle spasms Good news is that muscle relaxers are cheap Bad news is they will make you sleepy and no way you should drink on them if youre a drinker If its not spasms start asking around for good doctors who will work with your insurance situation You will make a lot of calls before you find the right one but dont give up Theyre out there I promise Have you hurt yourself recently That is where your spleen is If it sticks out and is sore it is probably swollen  if it isnt an injury you may want to get some blood tests done as it is a common symptom of several diseases If you have had a severe cough that alone can do it But better safe than sorry Oh sweetie please dont think the worst It could be an assortment of things including cysts or noncancerous tumors  even an infected ingrown hair But the only way to know for sure is go to a doctor If it is that small no matter what it is it may not be a problem as it would be simple to remove Just dont let it grow before doing anything about it I am not a doctor but I get the same thing  my doc told me its trapped gasI bought aloe vera juice  you take 4 ounces  it hhelps alotTass just like water thats why I take it LOL you have to get it fro a health food storeHope this helpsTami  No The small yellowish lump is what is probably whats causing your eye to be red and hurt yes mild I had the same problem for 4 years Using medicines either knock you out or did not help the spasms of pain diazepam etc I eventually found two really useful solutions Baclofen stops the shooting back pain and allows you to walk and move around and move in bed safely Secondly the only solution to the problem was to get something done with the powerful back muscles themselves The only thing that worked and worked amazingly well was acupuncture in my case administered by a local Chinese medicine practitioner I have a PhD in pharmacology and was very skeptical about using acupuncture but the pain was so bad and affecting my life basically I couldnt move out of my chair I was forced to try anything Im so glad I did try the acupuncture it has reset the muscles in my back and now I am ok I dont even have to use baclofen anymore Hope this helps you I know how bad it can be Good luck David sounds like a pinched nerve My daughter had that and it was from too much textingcomputer sounds like it might be a urinary tract infection As one of member previously said light to throat and find any white or block dots if it is severe consult the doctor Im not sure if the bumps are a sign of cervical cancer but I would call your doctor and ask them It would probably put your mind at ease too Good luck I would wait a few more days and see if you get your period If you cant wait then get an early response test The further from your period due date the less certain your results will be Try waiting to test at the most 2 days before your expected period The date that you had sex is around when you probably ovulated so you could be pregnant Only time will tell good luck I did go to the ER back when this happened The doctor said I had a concussion That it needed stitches of some sort but since I was in travel between countries when it happened and there was a 24 hour delay in getting to a hospital that he didnt want to agitate it more and wanted to let it heal on its own Basically I went and it hurt really bad and was bleeding lots In the midst of the concussion I completely blacked out and could not see I vomitted etc all the things you dont want to happen I told the doctor all of this He basically gave me some brochures on concussions and how to deal with the symptomspain and sent me on my way But yes I did go to ER I did go to the ER back when this happened The doctor said I had a concussion That it needed stitches of some sort but since I was in travel between countries when it happened and there was a 24 hour delay in getting to a hospital that he didnt want to agitate it more and wanted to let it heal on its own Basically I went and it hurt really bad and was bleeding lots In the midst of the concussion I completely blacked out and could not see I vomitted etc all the things you dont want to happen I told the doctor all of this He basically gave me some brochures on concussions and how to deal with the symptomspain and sent me on my way But yes I did go to ER could be sinuses If I was her I would go back to my obgyn and see them  I am not a doctor but I have had a miscarriage my self about 11 yrs ago and I dont remember bleeding that bad after about 2 days just saying It could just be the way the baby is lying May be just premenstrual cramps It shouldnt be related to ovulation so close to starting your period Ovulation occurs 1014 days prior to your period I would recommend you touch base with your OBGYN to rule out serious issues like endometriosis or ovarian cysts stress produces gas by way of tightening the stomach walls Perhaps you need to find a way to express that anger perhaps talking with someone Diet Pepsi helps a lot as well Most probably an impingement either on a tendon or other When blood flow is blockeddizziness quite common What reason has your doctor given you for wanting to replace the IUD It seems like it was not a great experience for you Why does your doctor prefer that over birth control pills I would go back to himher and ask for more information before you make this decision Different types of birth control have different side effects and risks so you doctor may have something specific that he or she is worried about I had this similar sensation when taking another weight loss medication and my doctor switched me right away I now take adipex and have not had that sensation I would see if another one works better for you you may be and I hate to sound like a prune but it could be an STI either that or it could be BV bacterial vaginosis I had that took a pill and everything cleared up Best too get it checked  no Im no expert but with those symptoms she really needs to see a doctor and right away Sounds like possible heart related issue Id make her go ASAP It could be arthritis in your joint Id see my doctor if it didnt clear up after a reasonable amount of time  possibly hemorrhoids very normal even if you have sex its normal to bleed after just not a bleed like a period if its like that then go get checked out they should of told you that after they was done I was pregnant 3 times and each time they told me something different but kinda still the same answer How long have you had it it could be a urinary track infection slip disk see Doctor see an orthopedic or a neurologist you could possibly have a deep vein thrombosis blocking blood flow to your lower legs in other words it could be a blood clot you should get to the doctor and have him do a doppler asap any kind of stress to the body pain fever sickness can elevate the heart rate it sounds like an ovarian cyst that ruptured It happens everytime a women ovulates and it can cause your side to hurt as well In some cases it could be pcos But most likely not Hope this helps you may have trigeminal neuralgia pain signals travelling down the facial nerves this is a very common complaint for middle aged woman but can occur at any age this involves sudden sharp intense pain from under the ear down the jaw up toward the cheekbonehttpwwwpatientcoukhealthTrigeminalNeuralgiahtm please look at this page as it gives you more info than i can GO SEE A DOCTOR THATS ALONG TIME HAVING THAT PROBLEM Its honestly a 5050 shot but when my period was late I was having the worse pain ever in my lower back because my body was preparing my uterus for the period I say if you do not start in about a week take another test Neurologist prescribed me Frovatriptan which works on the migraine but not on the frequency which can be every day for over 10 days Sodium Valporate worked like a charm for a few months but then didnt I have just started taking the highest dose 600mg am and 600mg pm and keeping my fingers crossed Have also cut out the top 10 migraine triggers and occasionally testing for allergies by eating one of them for one day then back to diet for another 2 but its hard as you dont want to give yourself a migraine and I still get them anyway There has been an operation done in the John Radcliff to implant electrodes in one ladys brain which seemed to work but I was told by my consultant lovely man  not it costs 15k and my chances of having it were zero Have asked my doctor to refer me to a dietition but he thinks they are no longer available due to cut backs Ive lost 11lb in the last 6 weeks and now just hoping the menopause will cure me as it seems to with so many sufferers Might try cutting out gluten as well but then I cant have my porridge for breakfast Not sure about the phone answer  only had them for 4 months Someone else told me recently they suffered from terrible migraines then he said they lasted for all of  10 minutes Mine last 10 hours Plus Dont loose heart We still have good days unlike many other poor souls who have permanent afflictions like Parkinsons and Cancer Neck pain is a symptom The causes can be muscular neurological or skeletal Please rephrase your question I think youre asking if pain is a treatment for mental illness Or are you asking if mental illness can cause pain have you tried the symptom checker you need to go back to the doctor some of those could be symptoms of the birth control u are not taking it correctly or you could have something more seriously i d say you need a pelvic exam done go see a dr NO I would think that an orthopedist would be the best specialist for that Every time I have ever gotten a sprained ankle hurt something in one or both of my legs or had a majorly pinched nerve my PCP would send me straight to one This is definitely a symptom that can be covered by a lot of different diagnosis Ive also experienced pain there At first I thought maybe I was smoking too much or that my ADHD meds were giving me some kind of side affect I think to figure out how serious it is you have to think about your own medical history Do you have asthma If so it could just be a little swelling around the lungs that isnt typically too harmful You should also check on the possible side affects of all of your medications If you have a history of heart disease or heart attacks then I would pay special attention to whether your left arm I believe is going numb If you feel like it is probably an emergency go straight to the ER  If you feel like you can wait to see your PCP then its definitely something you should bring up during your appointment They can have you tested for many things which of course usually leads to a more definitive understanding of what is or could be wrong I too have fibromyalgia For the longest time I thought all of the pain I felt in my hips and that whole area was because of it There were many times that I had to be carried or had to stay in bed because it hurt way to badly to try to move an inch I had been told a few times that it was one of my symptoms that resulted from the fibromyalgia However I recently found out from my pain management doctor that my xrays are showing something no one ever told me about Apparently I was born with a deformity in which I have more bone on one side than the otherand this is what has caused me those specific pains for so long It is very possible that your pain is being caused by the fibro but it could also be caused by something similar to what I have experienced If I were you I would talk to my doctor about being sent for some xrays andor MRIs just to raise the chance of getting a more definitive answer andor rule some things out As I have found out over the past 2 yrs hallucinations can be caused by a number of things I would recommend talking to a psychiatrist My son started having hallucinations 2 yrs ago His hallucinations we found out were caused by anxiety Hallucinations can also be caused by depression among other things Talk to a therapist or a psychiatrist than can assist you with your hallucinations i have sex problem how to treat Sometimes this can be an indicator or something severe and conversely can be something to blow off Odds are that you have what is known as a hernia Also you may have what is known as an Intraabdominal hematoma been there done that whoever gave you the shot hit a nerve the burning is when the nerve missfiresits pretty much gonna hurt for a longlong timethis is just what happened to me when i couldnt use my right arm for three months i hope everything turns out ok I would not take anything other than Tylenol without approval from your doctor Generally that is all you are allowed to take for pain but it will not reduce swelling I would suggest elevating your ankle above your heart and using ice On for 10min off for 30 Just remember to wrap a towel around the ice pack so damage to your nerves and vessels does not occur from the cold Bad news is around that stage in pregnancy you will most likely be experiencing ankle swelling anyway which could complicate the ankle pain a bit Hang in there  I am not an MD but I am a retired RN I am also a chronic pain patient I dont agree with much of the other answer but I will agree with the aspect of the other answer that your body has become dependent on the pain medication at this point Some people may use the word addicted That does not mean just because your body is dependent on the medication that you are addicted in the sense that you abuse the medication Everyone who is decreased or weaned off their medication is not given methadone or other withdrawal drugs similar to it You can be slowly weaned down Just because the other person answering had an experience of using drugs to the point they needed methadoneor their Dr felt they did doesnt mean everyone else does My MD has weaned my pain med dose in half after he changed some of my other medications and it worked very well I saw him every 2 weeks He wrote a prescription each time for a titrated decreased dose I stuck with what he prescribed Started on the news meds Lyrica for one Discontinued other meds like paxil and nuerontin for two Stuck with the plan A person does not have to go through drug rehab in a hospital or use methadone or suboxone to lower their dosage Just have an honest discussion with your doctor about all your medications and what you might be able to try different Have you been on some of them a long time and is it worth it to make change to see if something new will work better I did not change doctors this is same doctor I was already seeing This was something I approached him about and we discussed and tried although I was nervous about it Most chronic pain pts are low risk for drug abuse Most dont take more than the prescribed dose Dr shop commit pharmacy diversion or go to the streets or internet to buy extra drugs or get extra prescription pain killers from friends or family that have some I know very well what drug addiction looks like I did get sick at one point from side effects of one new medicines we tried I went to an ER where they treated me poorly and I wonder now if it was because they think I was a drug addict even though I did not one time ask for a pain medicine or anything of the like Rose did you ever go to the doctor All I can think of for you to do days later since the tylenol has already been adsorbed would be to have lab work drawn to see if there was any damage to the kidneys or liver Otherwise I am not really sure I hope you are ok at this point In response to the new contributors here It is extremely hard to deal with a chronic pain condition Especially to deal with the lovely healthcare givers among you that you would expect to be the caring ones Like the loving caring Husband I met in Nursing school that made vow before God 25 years ago Lived a christian life But since I cant live up to being the wife he needs he has made up his mind that he needs he needs a divorce i tell you who in this life wants to live in pain or laying in bed in pain or take any medicines like cymbalta or lyrica or pain meds that make you tired Or fibro that makes you tired and less then able to function intellectually and physically like you once could BUT thank you web MD for mentioning Dr Patrick Wood in one of your articles on Fibro and I was able to find him in a clinic in Mississippi I hope I can get in to see him before my husband divorces me and I lose insurance coverage For anyone who reads this please pray for me please pray i am calling out to anyone who hears me Please anyone out there dont give up looking for new treatments they are coming closer now then they were 20 years ago or 10 years ago and believe there is HOPE never ever give up It is so important to never give up Giving up hope never helps anything at all I forgot to add to what fibrochon was saying about TYLENOL i truly believe I would not have NASH had I not used so much of it and the over the counter NSAIDS to help my pain prior to my diagnosis and that is a fact My liver enzymes now have been within normal limits for years despite all the prescriptions medicines i take I dont know I dont know if you wear high heels a lot but it can cause like a tightening of the tendons because they are not stretched out from time to time I had this and I had to wear lower heels and stretch multiple times a day Just stretch the achilles tendon by pointing your toes towards you slowly 1020 reps daily also dont wear heels that dig into that area Try wearing lower heeled shoes for awhile you can also stretch like that  work Capasaicin cream might be spelled wrong is great it burns at first but put it on for 6 weeks my pain is gone for years my podiatrist recommended it and I never needed anything else with the combination of stretching also good luck the doctor might do dilata instead of morphine I believe this is a sign of too much fiber intake If you are taking supplements I suggest you stop or lower the amount t youre taking because those supplements can actually Mae you very gassy Yes I would go to the ER if the pain is worse Do you have any other symptoms When did the pain start You failed to mention your age That could have a lot to do with your bone problems And you cannot get a MRI without a Doctors order If you are seeing your primary care Dr Ask him if he would refer you to an Orthopedic Dr for and evaluation Or second opinion Maybe her will order your MRI You didnt mention if his foot was swollen And or has any red lines in the area It could be as simple thing as gout Which is very painful And common for his age He would need further test to find the root of the problem You are very young to be having this type of problem Also 2 years is a long time to still be having this pain But without an xray it would be hard to treat You did not mention what the Dr who ordered the MRIS said Or did you return for the results of the MRI  It would be hard to treat without those results Or possibly an xray May not be that bad since the Dr just ordered physical therapy However now you may not even know Sorry Shingles is very painful Touching it or not You will still have pain It can be constant or intermittet of and on You are so young And have been to some of the best clinics and universities in the US And are you saying that you did not get a diagnosis or any type of treatment from any of them You say you have many conditions But did not mention what they are So there is no way of telling whether they may be connected More than likely a pulled or torn muscle If so you may have the pain for a week or two weeks However if you continue to have the pain I would see your family Dr or an Orthopedic Dr as you will never know if it is a disc problem without an Xray get pain from neck shoulder down the middle of the right armfeels like a burning sensation going though the veins Sounds like some irritant Especially being in the area that you are in I would flush my eyes out before going to bed at night and keep using moisturizing drops during the day Also upon waking would wash the lids by splashing water on them and then towel dry This would take away any irritant that settled on the lid while you were sleeping Change all bed clothes before starting this and keep washing them frequently to keep the airborne irritants off your sleeping space Clonazepam is for anxiety and is addictive There are other drugs for depression like Effexor Paxil etc Was she seen by a psychiatrist Thats the doctor who should prescribe these medications for her This happens to my husband most times also He was checked out and the doctor told him it was normal That was ten years ago and hes still fine it feels as if it is trying to pass my stone in the last 3  in my ureter when attempting to squeeze out the last amount of urine it hurt a bit and some blood came out Is this normal during the passing process it could be quarter size blood clots My 7 year old had the same problem off and on all year Her doctor prescribed an acid reflux medicine She also recently tested positive for hpylori which can cause ulcers I would suggest keeping a food journal of what she eats and scheduling an appointment with a doctor I am a dental hygienist and my advice to you is to see your dentist because it sounds like you may have a problem with the temporomandibular joint Most people refer to this as TMJ Dentists are very highly trained in the detection of all oral disease and head and neck disorders Do you frequently wake up with a headache in the morning This is another sign I hope you find out what the problem is and follow up with your Dr i hope she is old enough but she can be pregnant and if she is not then it can only mean one thing she sick and need medical attention immediately it can be an appendix bursting or it can be kidney failure if i were you id take her to ER now nothing just that youre straining something that needs to be functioning on its own if you dont want any fat showing in your belly then do some exercises and eat well so that your belly could be fat free normally not by you forcing your stomach to stay sucked in of course thats going to cause belly aches you are forcing your muscles to do something that you can take care of yourself the healthy way stop straining your muscles and the pain will not come back when i touch it i can feel it does this means it is alive If you have a pain when breathing in or notice this alot while rolling over this could be do to a inflammed intercoastal muscle Usually there is no treatment for that condition other than to take an Aspirin This happened a few years back to me due to repeated deep coughing from broncitis I was told it can also happen from straining your arm or even sleeping on your shoulderarm area in a way that puts excessive stress on the area It was painful and lasted a few weeks due to never being able to let that area rest as it controls your diaphram allowing you to breathe You may want to seek medical help if it gets worse though and maybe get a script for a mild painkiller There was a time when mine was so unbearable that I would scream my face off if I hadnt been afraid to breathe can u also feel a popping and granding u may have dislocated ur pelivc bone you must see a doctor immediately or er or urgent care center I speak from experience but I am a layperson in my opinion if persist i would go to the doctor immediately as I waited until i couldnt take it any longer and almost died from a perforated ulcer i wish i could help but i dont even know what she put in her arm as Im not familiar with most drugs I suggest you plan an intervention or call 911 if life threading I would get my gallbladder checked It could be TMJ Go see a dentist to confirm it I have the same pain in my jaw closer to my ear as well I also have really bad migraines due to it Hope i helped I know its on the left side but if it gets too severe Id go to the hospital since it could be appendicitis Not necessarily damaged Id say more than likely its just under pressure probably from a herniated intervertebral disc This is a fairly common condition known as sciatica if you wish to look it up You can alleviate the symptoms with stretching and avoiding the irritation of the disc It could be from sitting for long periods of time for example Sounds very much like appendicitis if it persists and gets too severe to stand go to the hospital no female I would recommend seeing a podiatrist if you havent already seen one Maybe special insoles made specifically for you could help My husband had insoles made for him It takes a while for your feet to adjust but will help if recommended for you I recommend seeing your doctor I have the same symptoms which for me is chronic sinus infection See your doctor soon Possibly a plantar wart They are tender and painful Check with your doctor You Should See a doctor Just Because Its The Neck and the Spinal Cord area See a Doctor To Make Sure your Fall didnt damage any nerves no dont see a doctor unless fluid of any kind pusbloodetc start to build up in it since he is a diabetic you need to have him see a doctor right away well it seems pretty normal just if the pain gets really sharp see a doctor well some medicines require to be taken on a full stomach  make sure she has a full stomach and keeps water going through her system there is such thing as vitamin B12 injections which are injected into your joints talk to your doctor about that it could help here is a link of things to expect and questions and answer httphrmsupportcomdrrecommendeddrugsvitaminb12injectionshtml some medications cause numbness some meds cause numbness I have had many bladder infections in my life and one time i let one go and slacked on taking my meds my dr prescribed me and it ended up turing into a kindey infection Which cause horrible lower back pain and pains in my abdomen I would look into that I have used Biofreeze in the past I had this prob in the past and it was a stye i alternated hot and cold and it brought the head out then it

been getting epidurals for the last two years sometime the dr hits that nerve that control the lower part of leg in my case is my sciantic nerve fun not when i get bladder infections the pain is awfull so i can relate usually when i soak in a hot bath i get imediate relief i hope it helps for you In Herbs of the Earth by kidney stone pain relief she lists under stones and gravel in the urinary system pertaining to kidneys and the bladder that these are rare where apple cider or vinegar are a staple of the diet I note that this reference does not state whether the vinegar needs to be apple cider vinegar but the brands in the health food aisle are less processed I do that all the timeeven in bed GO SEE A CHIROPRACTOR I wouldnt want to live without one since I started seeing one Usually a quick adjustment to the neck is all it takes Also ice packs to the area help with the pain Incontinentyelloworange stool gelish and loose stool No longer have gallbladder Cause I dont agree with the 1st answer and the judgement that you are an addict  a word used for people with chronic pain way to often The 2nd person certainly knows more My 39 yr old daughter who was under the care of a legitimate pain mgmt doctor died on Christmas 2012 She had to be drug tested at every appointment and didnt get any pain pills from another source She was doing the right thing But since the EMTs majority are wonderful saw her medication by her bed where she was so ill immediately assumed she was an addict and had overdosed and treated her with that in mind Her husband was there and couldnt convinced them otherwise An autopsy was performed and cause of death was because of violent vomiting her colon twisted and then her bowel perforated You have people who do understand your anger It is time that not everyone with chronic pain is considered an addict because it isnt true No one should be humilated and made to feel they have done something wrong It could be your pancrease you probably have an astigmatiziam which is weak eye muscles no go to ER possible appendicitis Spider bite yes I would say its probably infected I say call your doctor to get checked for a UTI Some UTIs just dont follow the rules no pain no fever and you think no way Better safe then sorry untreated UTIs can cause bad infections and possible damage  When I went to a pain management center I was given a series of steroid injections3 and Norco Hydrocodone Receiving no relief the doc increased the dosage of pills Are you taking the maximum strength 10325mg Next I went to a different doc who took a CT scan and discovered I had Spinal Stenosis which was the cause of the pain A pain management center can not do anything for that A neurologist can address that problem Good luck I know so many people that hate when a doctor wastes their time but please do me a favor and go see your doctor I have my own problems with lower back pain and it took me asking the right questions and not dealing with a doctor that wasnt willing to help To find out 3 months later I have a genetic issue and it caused me to break my backThe bigger reason to see the doctor is that I just lost a very dear friend that didnt think doctors new a thing and after dealing with so many visits to the chiro we got her to the doctor It was too late as she had bone cancer and it wasnt found soon enough She suffered a lot as do all of us that wish we would have forced her sooner The right doctor is out there you just have to be willing to do the work to find them I also suffer very bad from daily chronic migraines for 40 yrs While my neurologist is trying his best to help me I still have to go to the ER a few times a month Its gotten to the point where I know all the doctors  nurses by their first name Most of the doctors  nurses are very caring  understanding but there are a few that should have chosen a different profession When I am in that excrutiating pain  vomiting the last thing I need is someone acting like theyre doing me a favor  Im not as important as other patients All I ask for is imitrex zofran  benedryl  some of these people act like Im a junkie I have been sent home sometimes in worse pain than when I arrived I once asked for a second dose of imitrex after 2hrs of getting the 1st injection I was told by this nasty little young female doctor that it was inappropriate I had no idea what I was supposed to do with that When I am treated like a piece of crap I immediately report them to the hospital Its really hard living with migraines when most people dont understand  look at me like Im crazy  exaggerating could be just pulled mucles but could also be cracked ribs Have you ever seen that comercial of a person with an elephant sitting on their chestI think it is a COPD comercialIt also says something about having a hard time breathingHave it checked out to make sure what it is My achillies tendons are still enlarged but I have to wear shoes that dont irritate themI was told that women that wear high heels get this problem with their tendons but I dont wear heels so Im not sure why I got thisI would go to the doctor to see if your blood tests come back ok Yes It could be a recurrence of the same problem What is the answer to my question about pain front to back lower left quadrant of front you could have Eustachian tube dysfunction try blowing your nose a couple of times a day or use a saline nasal rinse hernia i think u should try to get in with a gi dr your primary may not be able to help also try to cut down on fatty foods and drinking it will really help a gi dr will be able to do tests to see whats going on in your stomach and other organs that aid in digestion Also I am a 17 year old female if that helps They already did a pelvic exam to check for any ovarian cists etc They said my appendix wasnt visible on any of the scans so I might not have one I dont know I just need help asap If not internal hemorrhoids may be more serious problem of fissure This is a tear in the tissue of the anus or rectum It can be quite painful It can also cause some bleeding upon elimination My husband had this problem after having radiation treatments for prostate cancer It was quite painful and lasted several months until it was diagnosed Warm baths and a special cream helped heal it i used to get these type of tension headaches all the time there is a ringing in the ear also for me my doctor ordered a catscan and all they found was i hadhave chronic sinusitis what helps alleviate me when i get these is i sit straight up and stretch my neck muscles slowly bend your head from side to side pulling your neck and upper back muscles while pushingpulling down on your shoulders at the same timedo only to the extent that you can of course i start my days with these stretches and i make sure to drink alot of waterhope this helps you Im so sorry you have to go through the painbeen there and doing that I am 23 and I have been in intense pain since I was 12For years my gyno said it was endometriosis even though anytime he would do surgery to remove it it wasnt severe enough to cause the amount of pain i would still be in and he just said I was a baby with pain and i was faking I was 12 10 years later i moved to California and sought another opinion from a new gyno She gave me a PUF testwhich is a questionairre for bladder pain You have to score low on this test to be normali scored extremely high and she referred me to a urologist He took one look at it and asked me if i had ever heard of interstitial cystitis He scheduled me for a cystoscopy with hydrodistention He said the previous dr who had done a cystoscopy didnt diagnose me because he didnt do the hydro Turns out I have severe interstital cystitis I have no lining on my bladder and i have bleeding ulcers Ive had to change everything about my lifestyle If i would have been diagnosed sooneri wouldnt be this bad off Hopefully you dont have this horrible disease but i hope this helps a little You can email me at erinmariegoodfriendyahoocom if you have any questions or just need to talk Your toe is cramping causing it to move downwars  it would probably be pointless to go to a doctor They normally wont do anything even if you broke your toe because there is no way to cast it best to tape it up with regular medical tape I also hurt my back a few years ago I ended up having surgery but the leg numbness tingling kept getting worse I done a nerve test I forgot what the name of test was at the hospital and it showed I had nerve damage in back and both legs One doctor said it was because doctor let the disc press on the nerves too long I now have to have a second surgery because they failed to fix a tear between l4 and l5 Please make sure you see a neurosurgeon instead of an orthopedic doctor They really messed me up My damage is permanant please see a doctor soon so maybe you can fix it before its too late frequent urination extreme thirst and unexpected weight loss So I bought an online remedy to relieve the painful itch of shingles Apple cider vinegar And it relieved the pain well enough for me to be able to sleep and work wellwe cant be sure for ur pregnancyu may be or may not be it should be good if u ll tke a test after next 10 dayssome times due to climate change periods came latenothing to be worried Well its either your appendix had mine removed at the ER visit or it could be gallstones Id say its more likely to be your gallbladder and a flare upgallstones My family has history of gallstonesgallbladder issues and both my parents have their gallbladder and appendix removed My mom had the same symptoms you had and went to the ER after her pain was so bad and had an emergency removal of her gallbladder Hope you find the answers you need I would also like to point out the fact that they may just be super tender due to having Fibromyalgia or a like illness My attempt to find a new PCP has resulted in my pain meds being cut in half as yours have I hurt prior to taking pain meds due to FMSCF Broken ankle bad back etc 1st new Dr looked at my chart and exclaimed Fibromyalgia They dont know very much about that I was diagnosed 11 yrs ago He put me on a meds contract again then proceeded to dismiss what he read about my history in my medical records of 32 yrs Told me to lose some weight and threatened to have me dismissed from the medical facility if he found out I had gone to another Dr to attempt getting more pain meds or I tried to refill my script early Then walked out of the room with a parting comment of Im just trying to help you live longer Now When a practicing physician disregards a diagnosis of a recognized chronic disorder from a fellow Dr due to his ignorance and then changes what has allowed someone the ability to function for the last 5 years being beneficial When Doctors stop practicing in the medical profession do they know everything Does increasing pain levels really be beneficial to his patients Or is he covering his butt due to the new regulations on pain medications A second attempt with another Dr with the request for 1 additional pill a day was refused My type of arthritis pain wont be helped with this type of pain med was his pretzel logic and he also refused to acknowledge my FMSCF as a health issue The pain meds were working prior to their reduction If Drs where worried about addiction why did it suddenly become all inclusive with so many people with pain issues Chronic health issues are for life Reducing or weaning off pain meds wont stop someone hurting from a chronic condition Constant increased pain from the condition that was the basis for the pain meds being prescribed in the first place will result in the patients inability to function as they have in the past will increase their chances for depression and paint a pretty grim future for them OK Lets go with the To much Tylenol theory The prescription pain meds have less Tylenol as the Hydrocodone increases Vicodin 5500 Lortab 75750 Norco 10325 Take away the Hydrocodone and people will start taking otc Tylenol at 500 mg tabs to help reduce the increased pain How much sense does that make Start taking NISAIDS If they worked why would I need the hydrocodone I already tried that How about the Medical Profession and Drs stop BSin patients and explain the real reason this has become an issue Drs are afraid of getting their hands slapped or god forbid have to pay a fine due the Governments abstract strategy on reducing street drug abuse Legit pain sufferers should not be punished due to the actions of street drug dealers OH by the way I havent gone through withdrawal due to my addiction to my pain meds but I sure due hurt a lot and am not looking forward to the future I have had 3 family members commit suicide due to depression issues Lets get honest here i think you should take rods advice hon i too had rotator cuff repairbicep and then cuff again when the dr did the cuff repair the first time he said that the bicep was only torn about 8  so he thought it would mend itself 5 months later took an mri and the bicep was torn by 65 so i went in for bicep surgery 5 months later another mri because i was still in pain needed rotator cuff repair again and trigger finger release surgery this last time my shoulder felt great a week after surgery but my finger was in pain and just didnt feel rightunfortunately i had a back pain and jerked my shoulder just a little bit which started pain in my armshoulder once againwent back to the drhe gave me antiinflammatory cream to put on my finger and shouldermade an apptfor 6 wksand sent me on my way i had this last apptgot tired of waiting 115 min later so i tried to get a new dr  they all keep saying they cant help me try going to the university hospital  so this is where i am at i guess what i am trying to say is that you definitely need a dr to look at it and if what your dr prescribes isnt working or if he decides you need surgery  get a second opinion when i had a tubal the gas pains were terrible in my shoulderthey told me to buy some gas xonly problem was it made me pass gas all day which would have been fine but i worked closely with 3 men lol my personal opinion is to rub and try to keep moving the area having the gas pains like burping a baby  feel well soon no I have not elected to have an Op yet I wanted to try a 2nd cortizone shot befoer I stoop to that i have had accupunture for severe arthritic spine and it really helped sounds a lot like what i am having myself i dont really have any concrete answers but from recent research i have done and the fact that you mention the yellowish stool a semieducated guess on my part would be something to do with your pancreas If youre 18 or older Advil Migrane and Excedrin Migrane are really good I dont know about all around pain relievers Advile migrane is a gel so it is easy to swallow and fastacting it also lasts all day Excedrin Migrane is supposedly the safest and 1 nuerologist reccomended migrane medicine Also if youre not talking about a migrane just a really bad headache please dont take these because these are really strong drugs and can hurt you if they are in your system fro no reason In my situation I have a herniated disk that is touching my sciatic nerve which is causing severe lower back pain that radiates down my buttocks leg and foot The only relief I have is sitting down Standing walking or laying flat causes the disc to push against the sciatic nerve and sitting releases the pressure So yes a herniated disc can radiate down the leg and butt you may want your dr to see if your sacroiliac joints are out of alignment sitting does aggravate the pain and stretching the area is not good for them either if you are having a problem with them i am currently having mine looked at bc i havent been able to walk right and have had extreme pain in the area for over 2 years i hope you get some answers soon It sounds similar to some sensations I get from FibromylagiaIf the sensation is like a burn and it makes it hard to move your muscles sometimes I would do some research on other fibromylagia symptoms and see if it matches up Good luck Probably a stone in the right one as well My son is 43 and has kidney stones since he was 18 Usually has multiple stones in both kidneys At one point he had too many in each kidney for the specialists to count It could be a sign of false labor or of early labor Your best move would be to consult your physician Acetaminophen is not addictive in the same sense that narcotics or steroids can be However it would appear that he has become dependent on it The first thing I would point out is that acetaminophen is a liver toxin so taking it on a daily basis for that long may be doing significant harm at the same time it is relieving his pain If he has severe enough pain to need daily relief he needs to find out the cause Pain is merely a symptom so taking a pain reliever is only treating the symptom rather than dealing with root cause Most definitely YES  Blood in the stool in never normal and from what you have described it is very serious indeed If you have lost a significant amount of blood through this it can be a lifethreatening situation yes Steroids have lowered my immune system and I have caught colds in the past while taking them Also I rarely get sick at all My answer to you would be yes I also suffer from depression stemming from Multiple Sclerosis Initially I didnt feel I was stressed either Mr doctor told me that dealing with the pain from the MS was causing the depression I am on lyrica have been since January and have not experience and knee pain no I dont think so could be a local infection you may want to see a doctor cayenne or cappssaion should help try cayenne or hot spice foods I had the same problem with my thumb and 2 fingers next to it It was caused by a blood clot they dissolved the clot and the two fingers cleared up rapidly but the thumb hasnt cleared up yet I will have to go back to be checked for another clot or possibly gangerine This may be an infection but its better for you to go to the doctor if you havent already because the only way to have a centain answer is by excamining you yes No according to depoprovera cl side effect information that i found u can look it up wwwrxlistcom hope this helps 6 weeks yes im going thru rotator cuff surgery right now and it does go cold soemtime i believe its from the lack of or not enoughcontact from nerves properly DO pregnancy confirmation testYou will knowFuture you have drugs to avoid pregnancy doubts if you take precautionary drug Loin pain is usually due to kidney problemsInvestigate for liver disease also Cancer is painless conditionSo only we miss early stageAny lump painless at armpit can be associated with early breast cancerImmediately you must have biopsy done Sore swollen neck near my wind pipe on my left side None at all Have u had a chest xrayIf not u shouldI have had pluresy twice which is fluid arround the lungsit is uncomfortable and can not be cured just has to run its course But having a chest xray would rule out fluid in the lungs also You should see the doctor you may have some cartilage damage in the meantime time I would try otc patch like salonpas Dont know it sounds like an infection try alcohol and cleaning it soak it in warm water with salt also take an alergy pill just in case if you have them worstcase senario you might have an alergy to whatever scratched you but i general is just sounds like an infection it only tingles when my ear rings At 22 years of age dont gamble with suppliments and home remedies see an ortho specialist Ive had several knee injuries and two minuscus surgeries as a result of procrastination Get your knees fixed now so you can avoid an arthritic condition down the road Good luck Sounds like food poisoningfrom undercooked food I would seek medical treatment Only if it is Oked by your doctor No this is not normal i would stop using and contact my DR Yes get checked ASAP Sounds like a kidney infection Im going through the same thing right now at first the pain was when I peed the pain and pressure thing UTI symptoms now Im noticing more pain on my left side as well and feel nauseous also Also I have a slight fever now Going to make a doctor appointment tomorrow let me know what they say Best of luck to you I would not let any doctor do surgery on my spine unless really needed and if the cysts are NOT bothering you much and you can live with them then just keep a watch on them and live your life the best you can I have never heard of back pain causing heart problems If you are having that much problems I am surprised the doctors havent tried to make you more comfortable and done XRays on your back Also a chiropractor can help with that if you are out of alignmentBetter than drugs Go to a chiropractor take Glucosomine and it is cheap through puritan pridecom They have the best deals Other problem could be your loosing bone and need to see a doctor Another guess would be your shoes good luck First of all I would call your dentist Perhaps the stitches are not holding and heshe will need to have you come in immediately Until you go in I would use an ice pack or even ice cubes in a washcloth and apply it on the outside of the immediate wound If you have any gauze fold it up into a small square and apply on your wound Hold your jaw closed for at least 15 minutes My husband had 18 teeth removed for false teeth and went through some of this Also are you taking aspirin If you are you need to stop until this gets resolved Aspirin thins the blood If you do not get relief soon you may need to go to an ER Best of Luck Oxycontin though be aware it is very easy to become on and very difficult to stop taking Your Dr will decide if your pain is considered chronic and if the severity of it warrants taking this medicine Is the medicine Zovirax or something like that Do you have pills also Do you think you could have washed in the shower a little too roughly When Ive gotten them mine are actually Herpes but called them Boils for years because my husband wouldnt accept it until I made him go with me for a test last year I do realize we get regular ole boils also However Ive never heard of bleeding If the sore is currently Open I would stop the medicine for a day then start back again and see how it does Alternatively I wish you could see or talk to a Nurse or Dr but if youre on here you may not be able to do that Another thing Ive found soothing is putting a warm Chamomile tea bag on there for 12 hour I got that from hubby he brings me a bowl of hot water to keep rinsing  steeping the tea bag When you wash just Blot with a clean cloth dont reuse until washed  water only until healed better The Emergency Room taught me that because I became allergic to soap  all ointments when I had any infections etc It helps alot Floaters My dad used to experience these all the time especially when driving or looking at a bright backdrop Here is a page of information on them Hope this helps httpwwwwebmdcomeyehealthbenigneyefloaters  My right side shoulder has pain that makes it hard to turn my neck If it grows rapidly in size and is extremely hard and painful it could be MRSA or Staph infection However if it is staying the same size it may just be an ingrown hair Ingrown hairs can get infected and become staph so make sure you clean it and not mess with it  In the manic phase the person can tend to act impulsivelypartake in unpremeditated risky behavior that they normally would not so therefore its possible that cheating and stealing are something that occur when she is in the manic swing of it BUT it is no excuse to liecheatsteal There are some people who are bipolar but would never cheat or steal but they would drive their car recklessly etc Call her doctor and express the things that are going on I am sure heshe would be a good help Bipolar disorder is about moodslying cheating stealing is about their character she has probably done it for so long that her bi polar disorder is a good excuse to get her out of tough situations like this one I have had tendonitis and bursitis in my shoulders for several years now causing pain in my shoulders neck and upper back I get severe headaches lightheadedness and dizziness that according to my doctor and chiropractor are directly related to the pain I have in my shoulders From my understanding it is pinched nerves that actually cause me to get lightheaded and dizzy It is important to note that I also have neck pain stemming from a side to side whiplash injury from an auto accident 12 years ago I believe its one of those questions which came first the chicken or the egg So Im curious if you also have neck pain IF you have neck pain from an accident or injury I would definitely recommend getting seen for that as well I would also recommend seeing either a neurologist or an orthopedic surgeon or both to see if there are any remedies for the cause of your pain I just had an arthrogram done a specialized MRI on my shoulder and have finally discovered that I have several large bone spurs on my shoulder rotator cuff and collar bone that surgery can fix I am NOT a person who jumps into surgery but after years of suffering I and my doctors feel that it is the last option available to finally get some relief I wish you good luck in finding the cause and hopefully a remedy for your pain and lightheadedness I am a FIRM believer that pain is our body telling us that something is wrong and we should NEVER ignore it no This is caused by your ovaries You are either ovulating or getting ready to have period or have just started This sounds like either pinched nerve in your neck or maybe even fibromyalgia You need to get this checked out You might have scolioisis That is a symptom where your spine curves to one side at a certain angle I had it for 3 years and had to wear a brace It can cause pain golfers elbow effects a tendon inside the elbow Maybe that is it Have you tried using a brace when working out That may help I have known people who have joint pain due to tennis elbow or doublejointedness and they wear braces when they play tennis I would ask for medical tests Xrays Maybe you have a herniated disk or pinched nerve somewhere close to your spine but there is a possibility it is more severe I dont know what a doctor would do but I would be persistent I do not think it is easy to lose that much muscle mass without decreasing exercise quite a bit I would not expect chemical imbalance that rapidly without damage to cranial glands or quitting steroid use or something I would keep a food diary and see what foods make these symptoms worse It sounds like a food allergy if you are getting headaches You may want to ask a pharmacist to see if these are side effects of the contraceptive Sharp stabbing pains can be gas pains I would avoid or reduce intake of inflammatory foods such as anything deep fried any refined sugar or wheat products and dairy products I have been on an antiinflammatory diet lately and have kept a food diary I found out that I have a problem with almonds as well as corn and that it is best for me to keep cheese consumption to a minimum probably because it is inflammatory Good foods to eat would include fruits and veggies fish avocados which have antiinflammatory effects lentils and foods that have not been highly processed Taking probiotics may also help Keep your blood sugar balanced as much as possible This will help with the shakes So will the diet and probiotics as it will help your body absorb more nutrition As far as the cramps go I think that the contraceptive may be playing a big part in that getting more exercise when you feel well enough to do it may help I dont really know what to tell you about that I dont think the two are related When you have kept your food diary for a few weeks or month s it would be a good idea to discuss it with a doctor They may order some tests or they may be able to give even better advice You may want to discuss the contraceptive first and then go back with the food diary and have a followup with that parasitic infection TMJ pain Trans Mandibular Joint lies under where your ear is Highly disagree with the answer above You need to invest in a protein shake that has branch chain amino acids and glutamine in it for muscle tissue repairing and amino acids are protein if you were wondering For weightlifting it is a necessity to be drinking protein and keeping up with calories not fats in order to have the push the next day you workout I go to the gym 6 days a week and have been taking 165240g of protein with a lot of food rich in protein a day since my bodyweight is 165 As soon as I drink protein after an intense workout I feel drastically better I have trimmed my body fat by 6 in 3 months and finally packed on a six pack Hope this helps as it has tremendously helped me Alcohol affects every single organ in the body when one may think just the liver I will say that one glass of wine has been proven that it is not harmful and some studies show it is good for your body A shot of liquor will have more harm as the alcohol is highly concentrated but still has little to no effect at all on ones body One beer will cause essentially no harm in the body as well Now when looking at two or more drinks is when alcohol begins to turn downhill Starting with the most important organ your heart beat is slowed down as it is a depressant which is why caffeine is strongly disapproved while drinking Excessive drinking amounts can cause an irregular heartbeat and difficulties down the road The brain is affected and obviously alcohol kills brain cells It also blocks neuron receptors which is a reason why people tend make stupid decisions while drinking An alcoholics brain in a study have had scans done and become significantly different from those of people who do not drink The liver can gain fatty cells that can be hazardous if alcohol continues to be consumed over a period such as a couple years Other problems can arise such as jaundice and liver cancer but will be caused by a lot more than just one drink for a very long time Alcohol is also a diuretic which means it dehydrates the body which is why when drinking alcohol many people pee out a lot of water from their body to help pass the poisons from alcohol faster Kidneys are affected by having their functioning percentages being lowered if excessive drinking occurs Other organs have are affected a little such as breathing and bowel movements will be slower Another part of the body that may unnoticeably be affected is the esophagus and thyroid but primarily from liquor not so much wine and beer due to the higher level of alcohol percentage which results in a burning sensation when going down the throat Ultimately drinking one glass of alcohol will have little to no effect on a person Drinking in moderation is the key and keeping your drinks below 4 is helpful as well Hope this helps You more than likely have an ear infection but it is hard to tell from online I would recommend seeing your doctor who will give you medication and have you feeling better in no time hope this helps Please take your child to the Emergency Room as soon as possible if you havent done so already Pain in the back and stomach could be a variety of things He could have Appendicitis a bowel blockage a GI tract infection any number of things but with the vomiting fever and pain as you described it could be something very serious and you shouldnt wait any longer Better to be safe than sorry Good luck with your little one I will say a prayer for you all NoHard I dont feel pain during the day it is only when I am erect The pain is from the tip but really just hurts all the way down I can still orgasm and doesnt hurt when I do but is painful to the touch A few months ago I did have prostitus  sorry for the spelling  and had to go to the urologist several times to milk me To top it off was tested a few months ago for STDs and was told that I had herpes Ive never had a breakout that I know of but do have the medicine for it On occasion Ill just take it because the fear of breaking out scares the hell out of me I would really like to go to a dr and just get all the tests done and have an definitive answer as to what all is going on but it is extremely expensive and for an out of work person is tough So I have got to make sure I am going to the right doctor the first time Thank You On one side of the head this can be symptoms of TIA stroke brain tumor multiple sclerosis and other serious neurological conditions You need to see a doctor immediately to rule out any serious conditions If you are having ministrokes or TIAs you need to have treatment to prevent a stroke which can cause permanent damage I have PCOS and when I would ovulate Im on Depo Provera to stop that process until Im ready to conceive I would feel a sharp pain on my left or right lower abdomen that would last several hours and I would have to take ibuprofen and kind of breath through the pain with a heating pad on my abdomen This was ovulation for me confirmed with blood tests I only knew what it was because I was trying to conceive at the time and was tracking my cycles and monitoring all of my symptoms of ovulation and the next morning my ovulation test strip would always be positive This happened monthly for me when I started taking metformin Its not harmful just painful and annoying Its one of the many reasons I opted for the depo shot I dont ovulate I dont have that problem and it preserves my future fertility because I dont develop hardened cysts on my ovaries over time You could be having contrations Monitor your contrations How long they last and how often they are coming If you are having contrations more than 5 times in an hour or every ten minutes You should go to the hospital immediately You may need a perscrition of procardia to keep them under control or may possibly need to go on bed rest In one of my 3 pregnancies I remember the first time I had to go to the hospital and start procardia I was only 19 weeks pregnant Also if you have a small frame like I do it is easier for you to feel your contrations even eary in the pregnacy If they are not regular and you are not experiencing any other symptoms  such as spotting then just mention it to your obgyn on your next visit If you are also spotting go to hospital immediately You dont need to think youre strange or odd Most people at one time or another in their life become afflicted with such types of sharp chest pains A good thing to know is that pain that is sharp like needle is not often due to heart blockages You may need a cleansing in your body which should be done three to four times a year you may have fatty tissues Do you detox your system every season three to four times a year also are you drinking plenty of water and watch what you eat YES I have Cauda Equina Syndrome and was paralyzed from the waist down twenty one years ago I did Len to walk again and regained the use of my bladder after nine years My bowel does whatever it feels likethank God for large pads Moral ax has helped me not have to extract as muchhowever too much stool in the colon  for me does cause sciatic pain It could be nerve related I think a Dr visit is necessary and probably an xray Before Your visit write down all of your symtoms like doing the day does the pain get better Also are you having any kidney problems You may have Osteoarthritis see your doctor I have lower abdominal cramps Have been taking antibiotics and now I have a black stool Is this normal Kidney stones are caused from dehydration Drink at least 8 full glasses of water a day and take cranberry in any and all forms It could be Shingles you should get checked out asap it probably best to see a doctor about it it sounds like chronic migraines for me it execessive caffeine and diet issues that causes my headachs maybe read some books about headachs and migraine to see if you can find symptoms on what you are experiencing and see what you can do about it yourself but it might be better to check with a doctor about it sounds to me like it could be a chronic migrianes i had then almost 5 years now but i never had ears stopped up if your ears feel like it ringing or you hear little in it it could be from the migraines or headaches i reccomend to see a neurologist they can do test on you like EEG to look at your brain with different colors to show activity of your brain Go see a Chiropractor ASAP They can often fix such an issue in one visit Of course that matters on too many factors to list There is connective tissue right in the middle of the pubic area and if it goes out of alighnment even a little it can be EXTREMELY painful There are Chiropractors out there that know how to deal with this very effectively I also get these from time to time Typically one lump under one armpit That said I assumed it was an ingrown hair or some type of irritation from deodorant I ignored these lumps as they were few and far between I also researched the lumps and found that when painful they typically are not serious I noticed online that people suggested draining the lump themselves poking with a needle popping like a zit etc I do not think this is smart whatsoever You will only cause additional irritation One thing I have not seen as a suggestion to ease the pain and draw the lump out of the skin is epsom salt I use a warm compress of water and epsom salt when I get these lumps I do this a few times a day and leave the warm rag under my arm for roughly ten minutes each time This method works The fluid in the lump will draw out and the lump will rupture without poking If there is a deep lump then you have to let nature take its course and let it rise to the surface somewhat on its own but the epsom salt speeds this process along I thought of this method because growing up my mom used epsom salt to draw out slivers or a stinger I am shocked that no one has mentioned this online but thought Id share in hopes it will help someone With one deep lump I had I used the epsom salt compress on and off for about 3 days and on the 3rd day applied GENTLE pressure with the soft parts of my fingers and viola the lump popped and the pain subsided Btw it was grossLOL As for a new experience with lumps that I am currently having I have multiple painful lumps under BOTH sides of my armpits Obviously this is not an ingrown hair I have also been extremely tired have continuous night sweats and shortness of breath I went to my doctor only to find out that I have a severe infection coursing through my body which caused the lumps lymphnode infection They started me on strong antibiotics and I am awaiting results to find out exactly what type of infection I have Hope its not too serious So the long and the short of ita lump with no other symptoms may just be caused by some type of irritation A lump with other symptoms should be inspected by your doctor right away My doctor said that when these types of infections pop up lymphnodes they can get out of hand very quickly Just thought Id share Epsom salt can be found at any drug store or grocery store and is cheap IT COULD BE GOUT Ask your doctor about diverticulitis that could be Sciatic Nerve being pinched somewhere in the lower lumbar or sacrum area For the edema I had to get my lungs drained with a needle and have a Thoracentesis done which drains excess fluids between lungs and lining of lungs This helped tremendously Also try Lasix in IV form I just wanted to add that I have Fibromyalgia and MCTD as well and unbearable hipgroin pain on my right side I wasnt made aware until just last year that my right leg is a full inch shorter than my left at certain points This obviously causes extreme pain in my hip and leg I didnt think it would effect the groin though I use a hot towel or heating pad for my groin area when it flares up I wanted to ask the other commenter what did your doctor suggest you do about it Did he suggest a course of treatment to lessen your pain or better your quality of life My Doctor pretty much implied I had to live with itnot really what I wanted to hear Any feedback is appreciated Thanks Yes they can and do burst It happened to me when I was sixteen I thought I was birthing an alien or dyingeither way it was the most painful thing to this day and yes Ive naturally birthed my daughter Ive ever had to deal with I was in cold sweats trying to make it across the house in the middle of the night to get my mother to take me to the hospital but I passed out from the pain on my kitchen floor When I got to the hospital I was

deficit during healing pocess athritis cracked rib problem wsupportive tissue eat more fiber and check diet problem wpatella feed her prunes or some other laxative yes I have also been wondering if it might have something to do with the detox diet pills I have been taking for the past 2 months They dehydrate the crap out of me if I dont drink at least 814 big glasses of water a day which in turn causes painful headaches Thought maybe this could be a symptom of the dehydration as well I can consult with one of the physicians that I work with I just dont want to waste their time if this is just a symptom of being stressed anyone have any ideas thoughts opinions NO I was diagnosed in 22012 after 16 addl ER visits due to gallbladder problems they finally removed my gallbladder According to the surgeon who preformed my surgery I was made to suffer unnecessarily long He said it should have been removed within the first 3 visits I had quite a few gallstones I am on SS Disability for backneck issues and asthma and thyroid issues The ER doctors ordered tests which were not necessary and which Medicare did not pay for They did a CT scan numerous chest xrays and numerous sonograms in addition to blood work and urinalysis each time If I were you I would have it removed as soon your insurance or finances will allow DONT suffer needlessly as I did I now have a huge medical debt which I have no idea how I will be able to pay For instance one ER visit I was billed 11000  and another was 13000   my insurance only paid a couple of hundred dollars on each of these The lowest bill was close to 1000 which insurance only covered again a few hundred My surgery was almost 35000  for that I only owe 5500 go figure If you have a gynecologist make an appointment as soon as possible If not contact your ER or urgent care center and get their advice If they do not answer your questions and you havent got a doctor please contact the local Health office You could have another cyst or even Pelvic Inflammatory Disease or Dysplasia which could be an early sign of cervical ovarian or uterine cancer I do not mean to cause unnecessary worry I am only suggesting what I would do in your position Better safe and healthy than sorry See your primary care physician heshe may need to refer you to a specialist for colon testing check with your doctor to be certain but it sounds like you may be experiencing a problem with your sciatic sci  at  ic nerve It can follow the path from your center low back across your hip and down the outside of the leg to the ankle and foot It doesnt always follow the same path with everyone however that is what it sounds like to me I hope this helps I have the same issue happening to me right now I broke my leg just above my ankle in 1999 and ever since I have had issues around the platescrews site The doctor told me that what is most likely going on is over time the screws begin to loosen and even if they loosen just the tiniest fraction it is enough to rub against soft tissue and cause irritation He told me the best way to take care of this is to have it taken out which for me right now is not an optionno insurance no go So when it flares up I have to stay off my feet as best I can ice it elevate it and take an antiinflammitory That is what he told me to do if it looks like the stitchs could be pulled apart or if theres pain due to swelling id go to the ER exercise depends where you stitchs are located im sure just go to a chiropractor if youre lucky it will be easily diagnoseable Keep afteryour doctors theyll eventually find it  Ive had the same type of problems and it took awhile but they finally found the problem by doing exploritory surgery It ended up being my omentum was wrapped arond my intestine it never showed on any test and it would hurt terribly migraines are always accompanied by pain and frequently accompanied by light sensitivity Try to stay away from any light that hurts your eyes Once the pain subsides the light sensitivity should also If it continues I would suggest you see your eye doctor i had the same problem my dr ordered me an ultrasound and found out i had to get my gaullbladder removed The same thing happened to me I thought I was having heart issues but all the tests came back negative It was determined that it was anxiety A prescription of Xanax was all I needed I still have flareups of anxiety from time to time so I simply take the Xanax as needed httpwwwendofoundorgresourcematerials it depends does your doctor say you have osteoporosis yeah yeah i know it sounds like an old peoples thing but just ask your doctor Is the pain under your rib cage Need more details about the pain and where it is located and when it hurts anything is possible which side is crampy and has the back pain Left side usually signals possibly kidney stone or kidney infection and right side could be an appendix problem I would see your PCP or OBGYN STAT This could be a sign of cluster headaches if there on the left side of ur head and the pain is so excruciating that u want to smash ur head off the wall and u think ur eye ball is going to pop out of its socket If it persists day after day get an appointment with a neurologist I know from experience wouldnt wish them on my worse enemy He probably has an ear infection Unless there is fluid coming out of his ear his ear drum probably hasnt ruptured yet My guess would be that the popping is either from sinus pressure or fluid build up behind the drum I strongly suggest seeing a doctor before they rupture because it is EXTREMELY painful All pertaining to the surgery Give it a little more time It is hard sometimes for people to imagine that the rectum is so close to the vagina and that the female pelvic organs I would say if it is no better or not resolving follow up Continue to monitor the fever and surg site I remember my mother complaining about this same thing everyday for 3 years What I can tell you is that my mother was type 2 diabetic and had lung cancer She recently died in May 2012 I am not assuming that her food lodging or feeling lodged was associated with her lung cancer however it may have something to do with her being a diabetic She was never able to get an answer from her doctor to what may be causing it I sometimes feel guilty because there were times I thought she was just using that for an excuse not to eat I was worried because she was losing weight Thats why when I read your question it just immediately jumped out at me My answer to you would be to get your sugar tested And whatever you do dont ever give up on finding an answer because it could be something serious Hope you are better soon Pharmacies carry things like Motrin and pampren which help relieve cramps and pain maybe try that shingles are known to be so painful that you would not wish them upon any personI have heard them described as raw nerves being pinched with red hot pliersI cannot speak about alzdisease I have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome  Fybromyalgia over 25 years now The answers given so far are very good Pushing thru any kind of pain is now looked upon as unsafe All the docs meds nutritional supplements exercise  even new age unconventional information  advice that I have received over the years seem to agree on this Never push thru the pain personally i have suffered worse whenever I tried Start slow take breaks when your body feels the need build up slowly Always do your best Since this illness varies day to day your best may be different every day so keep that in mind  give yourself credit regardless how much you do I always try to take one step at a time no matter what I am doing or need to do I understand the pain and frustration and how different my life could be Ive had to learn not to overdo not to be afraid to ask for help when things are too much make sure I put my priorities firstIve raised 2 boys and try to always leave a bit of fun time for myself Also never stop asking what can I do differently  Has a cure been found never stop looking for answers even when they never come I hope you have a good group of doctors  wish all the best for you take a glass of water add 2 teaspoon sugar and a little bit of salt and juice of half lemon and shake it well than drink it slowly by sipping it you will get good result You should still go and see your Docter  So they are aware

because of taking less water bad eating habit or eating unhealthy food As far as medication is concerned I would like to suggest you to take the advice from doctor Dont try to take medicine without prescription of doctor otherwise it can create problems for you Beside that you should avoid oily and junk food take sufficient water develop eating habit properly and do some physical work I have a fused spine so I cant have MRIs What the doctors use is a mylagram I have tried both ways and I believe that exercise to almost to the point and then draw back pushing though seemed to prolong my pain and definitely added to it If you do push to hard then I would suggest that you immediately or as soon as possible be kind to your body with warm water soaks I know it is frustrating when you are used to pushing through your body pain to do and be what you want But there are painful consequences It could cause you to be unable to do anything I just know that pacing yourself is the watch word here Pacing yourself is a somewhat vague statement but it means to not to use all your energy doing one thing especially if you want to have other things in your life Its harder to do than say and requires practice We have athletes who do marathons and other difficult sport activities I hope this help Start slow when they say 1 or 2 minutes they mean it but soon your body will be able to tolerate it at most times and never never think if you have to take a break because of a flare up that you can just pick up where you started before the flare up start slower and build back up I have found that individual type sports like hiking swimming the noncontact sports seem to be best as it is easier to do that pacing I was talking about Good Luck hope this helps And do not forget to stretch  I beilieve you have a sprain or tear that you need to stop the activity and give it a chance to heal completly If not it will never heal you keep aggrivating it Sometimes when they do a lumbar puncture it can cause some of the spinal fluid to leak a bitI know it happened to me and it caused me to have a headache for about a week afterwards I just treated it as best I could and eventually the symptoms went away However if youre still suffering after a week I would go to your regular doctornot the ER Tell him what you had done and let him know what symptoms youre still experiencing That way he can see what the results are from your previous tests and maybe order more accordingly Good luck I have had a lot of back pain since I had gotten an epidural and the pain is usually in the general area where I received the shotthats just my own experience yes  \t \t \t \t \t \t\t \t\tBODYDIVTABLETHEADTBODYTFOOTTRTHTDP  fontfamilyArial fontsizexsmall  \t\t Looking for Chiropractic Specialist \t

long time and when you sit around without moving your legs it can cause circulation problemsMy blood clot started in my calf and a piece broke off and lodged in my lung I wouldnt wait to longGood Luck I have chest pain all the time and they ran some test and found out that I have severe gastritis and a spasm esophagusYou might what to have that checked They told me that when my esophagus spasms that it could feel like I am having a heart attack vertigo is a inner ear infection that somehow can be caused by anxiety or panic attacks or at least thats what they told my brotherhe was having really bad spells from it Sounds like colitis I had for that for years It sucks but I have been cured now for years thanks to a chiropractor Everything stems off your spin so if your lower back is not lined straight And for the bleeding drink aloe vera juice Is it actually on the eye surface or on the skin outside the eye If it is the first you need to get it checked out I had a corneal ulceration a couple of years ago on my pupil I found it early and did not have pain or blurred vision but was cautioned not to wear contacts for a long time It does require immediate medical attention If it is on the skin eyelids surrounding the eye it may be a sty or cyst You could try hot compressessoak a washcloth in hot water and apply three times several times a day The eye pain indicates you at least need to contact your doctor Hope you feel better Yes could this be a hernia i think its acid build up that gives the cramp usually athlete having cramp means theyre not physicallyconditionally fit to get muscle cramp if the bonejoint hurts it should be ligament or cartilage from wear and tear i had torn my tenden on my ankle and it heal itself but takes a while usually you should be able to take overthecounter pain killer med but if the doctor gave you instructions on what to do follow it if it get worst go see them Few questions What is the source of your neck pain If it is your muscle around your neck you can massagestretches to it and apply heat If it is your bone you should see a chiropractor are you properly resting stretching and putting coldslight pressure to let it heal how bad is the injury you really shouldnt mix painkiller by taking one then switching with another later Because you have inflammation its better to take mortrin Ibuprofen as it does everything same as tynol plus help relieve inflammation which tynol doesnt i had that problem when i was in puberty during my growing spurt period im assuming its your leg muscle spasm and it hurts to wake you up at night only thing you can do is stretch before it get to that state did you injured them is it from a work out or just chronic doing certain actionmovement requires those muscles to be used so you are expected to feel those pain when sitting like your groin if you get those pain too often without doing rigorous exercise then you should talk to your doctor to check those muscle out can you describe the neck pain otherwise you must have strained your neck somehow if you didnt injured them as you didnt get hit on the neck then how is your posture yes if there is a muscle you worked you did tear it What you are experiencing is kidney stone and from stories i heard it hurts Usually kidney stone build up is mineral or calcium Check your diet and drink a lot of water to prevent mineral build up I dont think smoking creates pain in joints as those symptom is a sign of arthritis You are probably more sensitive and those pain is something you may have just noticed instead If its the ankle ice with elevating the feet is the treatment Also you should support the ankle by wrapping it with bandage or immobilize it with ankle wrapsupport if you need to move around If its the arch stop putting pressure on it and let it heal go see a doctor you are probably going to have to have a x ray done should talk to your family physicians and pharmacist some pills are supposed to be taken before or after mills others doesnt matter as its the easiest reminder for the person to consume the pill after having a meal usually taking pills in combination is bad idea and there may be ingredient that overlaps and creates complication I have suffered with chronic back pain for over 20 yrs Yes I would see a doctor There can be many reasons for back pain and if you are constantly taking over the counter medicines you can actually cause additional harm to your body I made that mistake years ago and messed up my liver I would request an MRI from your current doctor If he does not want to send you for an MRI depending on your insurance I would ask for a referral to see someone else You can see another primary care doctor But getting an MRI to see what is going on will help you know what kind of specialty doctor you may need Have you talked to a doctor at all It could be a small fracture If it were a sprain the pain would have been much worse at the beginning Is it swollen at all Take Tylanol for the pain and if there is any swelling it should help with that as well RICE is a great aid for this type of injury but if the pain keeps up you may need an xray or an MRI Might need to change your GI doctor or possible look up on the internet and see if there is any research hospitals near you When I had the same problems as you my family got me into to see a GI doctor at Temple University Hospital Which is a research hospital and the doctor found out the problem I had gastroparesis I would believe it would either Dilaudid roxycontin or a phyentenal patch However at this time I have been on a strong pain med for 3 yrs called methadone my doct has disc seeing me as a patient and my new pcp will not give me any pain meds or refer me to a pain clinic so now i have to go to a methadone detox becuz it can take up to one year for your body to readjust after detox i will be going to a drug rehab I am not a drug addict these meds were given to me by my doct and I took mymeds as persricbed to me Now I am very sick If i could give any advice i would suggest trying a pain reliever like tramadol or toratal Being addicted to any opiate or opiode is something i would not wish on my worst enemy good luck to you in whatever you decide kylyj She should be fine depends on the location and intensity of the hit to be on the safeside I would suggest she sees her dr to make sure the baby is fine In my case it was due to a partial bowel obstruction i have the same difficulty and have found that mine is from degenerative disc disease However ive yet to find a way to stop them and i have had mutiple cervical neck injections massage pt and on and on Mine probably stems from a whiplash in the 70s massage and pt do help a little Try drinking some ginger ale or chai tea to help ease your stomach These usually help me after being sick and not able to eat Also you can try a smoothie It will give you the vitamins back you need and help fill you up He may need to have a blood test and an MRI scan to ensure everything is okay Diagnosis is so important for him I think you may have osteoarthritispain of jointsbecause your symptoms match the symptoms of Osteoarthritis To make sure if you have it or not you should visit an orthopedician There are possbilities of disease that your ear may have like an ear infection or a ruptured ear or hearing loss you should visitan ENT specialist as soon as possible This condition seems so serious it may be a seizure you should visit an emergency department as quick as possible Seek treatment as fast as you can I think it may need surgery tell your orthopedician about the pain you are experiencing the specialist will know about what type of treatment is suitable for it I just wanted to add that I did not get injured in any way that would have caused this We have to stand in derby stance which is basically a squat position and do crossovers It seems the crossovers are what really hurt my leg Im guessing with all the weight mainly on the left side If I go the other direction its only the left leg that still hurts not the right Ive asked other girls about it and noone has any idea I couldnt even find anything on Google Thanks for any input I strongly advise you to see a dermatologist as soon as possible Taking care of our skin is undeniably our great responsibility so you have to do all the necessary actions to keep your skin blemish free You may speak to Eric Schweiger M D or check out httpwwwclearcliniccom for the best in skin care You may advise your boyfriend to see a board certified dermatologist about that particular concern or he may check out wwwclearcliniccom It will be best to speak with a medical professional who can help you with that For the meantime you may wear comfortable clothes that will not irritate the area I have a feeling like I know what might be causing it now I remembered a time when I was young probably 12 or 13 around the time the pain started and we had these square floor scooters Well a friend was pulling me around on one using a jump rope I went extremely fast the rope broke and I went hurtling into the cement wall smashing my left side on it My entire left side bruised and was swollen for a while I think that during that injury I might have slightly fractured a rib or something I didnt go to the hospital after the injury so I dont know and maybe when it healed it healed slightly out of place In the part where it hurts there is a red line going straight across where the skin is actually pinched in I dont remember exactly when the pain started but I feel like this must have been the time since it was several years back Does this sound right Even if that was the issue how could it even be resolved The best advice I can give is to go see an oncologist Heshe would be the only one that could diagnose you with Lymphoma this is a case cevical spondylitis which mean iflamation of the cervical spine go to your doctor the one that did the surgery he know first hand after xrays If youre a female it sounds like an ovarian cyst nou should have a complete of restfor your lungs to be healthy I have had hypothyroidism for 21 years and it has never cause pain in my hand or my legsRemember though that hypothyroidism is an auto immune disease and once you have one systemic disease you are prone to getting others I also have rheumatoid arthritis which is another autoimmune disease and it first appeared in my hands with severe painI would have my father seen by autoimmune disease doctor by the way i got tested for arthritis and they said i didnt have it If you are a girl you could be pregnant  thats the first thing my doctor asked me when i had my back pains over a year ago  your spine could be unlined i forgot the term I would go see a doctor oh this is my post i was also nauseated the day before i started my period you can just go to your regular doctor and if its severe theyll recommend you to a specialist I had a root canal it didnt hurt me much unless i used cold water to brush my teeth or i drank something really cold afterward its every normal for it to hurt though i still have to go to get my crown placed on it though My pain is on the right side lower back i have been taking a fairly strong pain medication which only makes me drowsy so I can sleep but Im still in pain I see a Urologist every 3  6 months for chronic kidney stones This time though it is different I am getting chills and sweats associated with the pain Is this normal I have reflux hernia and use Nexium40 mg once a day At times I have to take 1000mg antacids or immodium after using the bathroom I try to watch what I eat Judging from your screen name as a diabetic you want to keep your hands clean cause you will not heal as quickly This is why your DRY hands wont heal as quickly I do not see your hands so I can not rule out a rash but I feel you may be confusing a rash with just general dryness Try some eucerin or cetaphil lotion its supposed to heal dry cracked skin Except some folks say it burns you may want to try to neutrogena skin therapy cream they have some serious stuff at the grocery store for dry skin go take a gander and see which bottle matches your hands The winter months make dry hands worse so keep inside and keep warm I might not be the best to answer your question BUT I have experienced this myself when I was 12 I had my FIRST period when I was 12 and it lasted for 3 months I was embarrassed to tell my mom cause I was young and very sheltered and didnt know alot about it back then but once I had big clots I told her and my doctor put me on birth control to stop and regulate my bleeding I know after pregancy blood clots could mean you are hemmorhaging I think its something youll want to call your doctor about because its not normal but Im not sure what causes it Sounds like when my bowel was blocked 4 days in Hosp Upper and lower GI Barium Xrays CT showed nothing blood work showed nothing at first Finally colonoscopy found 98 percent blockage and I had a bowel resection and was diagnosed with Chrohns This was after 7 years of treatment for IBS At least I know what I am fighting now Have lost 50lbs as well Best of luck Knowing is half the battle Could be an ulcer in the making Got to the eye doctor yes This is one of the greatest products out there when it comes to

to pay for compound medications And not a lot of pharmacies do these kind of medications but none the less it is possible Not everyone is the same nor does everyone respond to the same things So discuss your options vigorously with your doctor Pleurisy is a type of bacterial chest infection It will go away but only if you see a doctor and get antibiotics Other medications may be prescribed also A chest Xray needs to confirm diagnosis NO The baby could be sittinglaying on your siatic nerve Its nothing to be worried about its completely normal to have back pains and it can be more on one side or another just because the baby can be laying on one side more than the other If the baby is laying more in your back it can cause it but with it being more than the other I bout gurantee that the baby is just laying on that side more which heshe could be laying on the siatic nerve which can be painful I have had 4 so I know the feeling Hope you get feeling better If it looks like a red coin size circle it could be Granulana Annulare I have been diagnosed with this condition by a top rated dermatologist It starts with small red bumps that spread to the circle look I was told it

9878978918 Hi I Gave birth to my daughter at 32 weeks pregnant What i was recomended to do is Lay on your left side and drink a glass of waterIf the pain persists or worsens I would strongly suggest going to the hospital to be evaluated However if you have already lost your mucus plug I wouldnt take any chances because when that happens the onset of labor should take place within 2448 hours I however did not and i ended up waking up later that night because my water had broken Hope this helps some Primary care physician If you have not sought professional medical treatment I urge you to do so You may have only a hairline fracture in your sacral area but the pain may be radiating to other areas Please seek medical attention as soon as possible Can be caused by alcohol abuse or eating too much animal proteins in the evening meals this among many other issues I would Truly suggest to youYou have got to see a DrThis might be something seriousits Better to be Safe then to be SorryWishing you the best If you are asking if you should have it checked out then yes you should Better safe than sorry I AM NOT A DOCTOR BUT I HAVE COMMON SENSE AND LIKE TO STUDY MEDICINE Is it gone by now if not please please please please please see a doctor pronto I AM NOT A DOCTOR BUT I HAVE COMMON SENSE AND I LIKE TO STUDY MEDICINE Although I am not a doctor I am going to say no Impingement syndrome is typically caused by repetitive over the head activities Unless you are taking medication which should NEVER EVER be mixed with alcohol alcohol should have no affect on your impingement syndrome If you are not on medication and are insinuating that you would be drinking to relieve the pain I would recommend over the counter pain killers instead that will work a lot better than alcohol and not make you feel horrible in the morning Check in with your general practioner or local medical clinic Its probably infected IM NOT A DOCTOR BUT AM STUDYING BASIC MEDICINE Have you tried a fiber supplement It worked for me Also dont laugh try eating raisons IT WORKS Please immediately concern your physician for this many things can cause headache cluster headaches neuralgias  migraines I strongly advise you see a physician to have this checked out If youre sensitive to light andor sound and the pain is usually on the same side it could be a migraine Nausea and aura weirdness in your vision can happen too Regular painkillers wont help as this headache is caused at least in part by a serotonin imbalance in the brain Ive had luck with ice packs caffeine and quiet rest in a dark room The only thing that has really helped is Imitrex but that has worked for over 20 years It might be ear wax that is coming out while your sleeping and then as you move around it goes back into your inner ear Thats just my opinion though I suggest when you wake up clean out your ears not going to deep could damage inner ear as well as using ear drops also known as ear wax removal aid That can be a pain in the butt when first using it just make sure you read the directions carefully It does work pretty well for me anyways no dont seem to have any back pain  To add to the original question I have difficulty to focus when reading to the point I must look away If I look down the pain is sharp I also have swelling in my hands and feet sounds like FLUID RETENTION I have the samething all the time nearly see a Chiropractora MD will only waste your money and give out drugsa good Chiro will make the proper diagnosis without drugsI had samething I went to mine todayits was how I sit while on laptop that made a disc go out she fixed it quicksounds like your wife has a pinched nerve too much fat in stools cause by pancerous not working rightshe needs to see a Pediatriciannot a FAMILY DR could also be related to digestive tract issues Hi Dear sorry you are in such pain I too have the same pain symptoms I just had a lumbar MRI and something showed up in my Thoracic Spine which is above the lower back and can radiate into your butt and hip There is no position that I have found that is comfortable I encourage heating pads some people use iceBut first and most important go see your Doc and demand an MRI of the Thoracic spine And most of all good luck try to stay away from having surgery and if you need help you can contact me sugarskissgmailcom i would suggest getting your appendix cheked I would definitely use an inflammatory  That reduces the swelling I had the same symptoms twice which were excruciating I almost killed the ambulance it was so bad I was diagnosed with Diverticulitis I had to have emergency surgery  a colon resection It was explained that depending upon the length of my intestine it would determine if the portion that was inflamed was cut would there be enough to reattach If not then I would have to have a colostomy I was lucky I didnt need that However the symptoms returned a couple of years after that surgery and another procedure was done No no colostomy It is very important to keep the intestines clean as much as possible  water and veggies help a lot as well as fruits Any abdominal pain is never to be ignored It is not for you to determine if it is gas or not Any self diagnosis could prove more harmful and could be fatal See the doctor right away or go to the ER no also doctor can check for blood clot But usually you will have more increased warmth in that area But its safer to be checked out then to have a clot travel to your lungs which can be a big problem Better to be safe You also could have injured your muscles from walking differently then normal with the blister You could be experiencing an atopic pregnancy or signs of a miscarriage Check with your doctor as this is not normal It could be a virus such as norovirus that comes from food poisoning Because of the severe abdominal pain and because you are not getting better I would go to the ER Marieh9 Constipation is a side effect to pain medication especially if never taken I had my C67 replaced in July of 2013 had same problem simple healthy remedies prunes or the juice also you can take 1 tablespoon of olive oil daily until it breaks loose and its also good for skin If you cant drink straight mix with lemon juice and 1 cup water Good luck Im not a doctor but I to opted not to take pain medicine at first and had neck surgery I experienced high levels of pain 247 using over the counter rubs pain relievers ice and heat packs my blood pressure kept climbing to numbers that could have caused strokes and also started having frequently bad headaches after discussing with doctor I opted for pain management I noticed a change in my blood pressure and headaches within couple weeks Everyone is different but mine was associated with the pain  OMG Yes it is hard and takes time with them Mine is the same But anyway I would take her back to the ER and tell them what I had too and dont leave until till they do something If she has a blockage that is dangerous and they should know that and they should help her in the hospital They can not refuse you And I know from myself there are doctors in the hospital that take care of stuff like that tooEnemas and softeners arent going to help You might try a warm bathe or a warm towel on her stomach HOSPITAL dont wait a month or if you know the GI doctors or even the nurse of them someone else may be able to see her I am sorry I know what its like wish I could help more Sorry to hear I know how you feel and its no fun been there and still do Call your doctor and tell them you need something else not just a softner Some stuff takes a while to start working so therefore you still have to wait Your doctor will be able to tell you what to get or they may give you something Make sure you tell them what you are doing so they will know Dont wait and keep wasting your money on stuff that want help Good Luck Do not come off your medication without consulting your Dr There can be serious consequences if you dont do it gradually because you are on such a high dose Mary no Could be Migraine however check with your doctor just to be sure and safe Thanks Talk to your trainer and have it checked by your doctorsince your a newbie hopefully is just regular pain that you get from working out  Do you have a any bump in your hip jointif you do and it hurts when you move around and it hurts if you touch itsorry to say you might have hernia Thanks Emily You do not have to discard them but I would recommend that you bleach them all in the inside and maybe even take the sole out and bleach it as well I have had a staff infection on my inner thigh before and my mother would always bleach my shower after every one I took nopain is on my left side You need to see an orthopaedic doctor If you lie down on back and turn your feet toward each other does the pain worsen If so the pain is coming from your hip joints The pain can be caused by disc problems in your back Either way you need to see an Orthopaedic specialist Ask around for a GOOD doc and much luck to you I had the same symtoms Mine started behind my right ear then in my neck and shortly later in my shoulder and down my arm But after a year pain started on my left shoulder and arm My hands and fingers started going numb and tingling My first MRI showed a little disc bulge Couple of years later the MRI showed stenosis I had surgery Helped but a year and half later I got internal scar tissue and I have stenosis from that which is displacing the spinal cord So now Im worst than I was So good luck Also an MRI always doesnt show the problem until it becomes bad I think there are other tests that can help Or maybe you need another pathogist to read Your MRI AND see a Orthopaedic specialist and get on a payment plan Woke around 6 am with terrible bloating right upper abdomen and back pain pain has persisted to increase through out the day as well as my temp Diareah started shortly after waking in 1015 minute frequency and has lasted the entire day with legs cramps starting around noon vomiting as well but not as often with dizzy spells and imidium has not helped at all Was able to hold a little chicken soup doen and gatorade 8 days before my fusion was scheduled I bought a new table chirs no one was at my apartment to help and had i left it would be stolen so i carried down a double flight so 3 days later my whole body shakes uncontrollably and wont stop it took er 15 min to stop me from shaking uncontrollably all over I was in so much pain i yelled and behaved horribly my dr shows up day3 and has an attitude and has me transferred he didnt believe my husband on day 5 when he opened me he sent a nurse to explain he had planned one fusion and there were more It was so bad i really would have been ok dying but that passedits a hell of a thing to happen to a person you loose friends you cant clean as well and you are really really doing your best to be nice to the often oblivious people around you thats really for a phd but i can tell you my mothers si joint was a off and on kind of problem that she only gets relief from those injections steroid injections I had fusions at l45 L5S1 and the thing I noticed in post op was that pain in my leg was gone But If I was in the same pain I was in before last surgery I think I might check out a couple other Drs And They would be the leading Drs in their field The more you get cut on the more sscar tissue pain and neurilogical pain  Thats a tough Question Have you considered a pain pump I wouldnt trade mine for anything good luck consider yourself lucky what you described doesnt sound like a herniated disc sharp burning pains throbbing all day and that is the best thing i can say about that sorry i soulnt help more I realy hope you havent come down with carpal tunnel in wrist and arthritus that is causing the arm weakness But all of those are better options than learning that The thorasic part of your back is messed up The arm pain may be as simple as you unknowingly holding it differently through the day and the rest sounds like middle back issues I am full of more opinions than i am at winning over a jury So the jury is out and if i were right you go see no less than 2 of the top ten neurologist because second opinions are always a good idea but dealing with neurological pain you make sure you see a established dr and then one that has been in his field 3440 yrs of age Lots of conflicting new procedures out there First I moved to Texas with my sleigh which my momma said id have no use for The first year here it snowed and snowed I was the only one with a sled and full of wisdom for other uses of large round trash lids and the tubes they normally used to float down a river Secondly you may have that bronchial infection plaging us If you can aven tolerate laying flat for 60 seconds youve dodged a bullet and maybe injured a rib Sorry Its been my experience that if you have a neurosurgeon or 2 in mind to get 1st and 2nd opinions from the neourologist oeeice works closely with a great many primary care physicians They will go out of their way to get you set up with a dr that doesnt just pretend to care one that does likely after the MRI you will be assigned a pain management provider Please be careful with that Dr If he Offers alternatives to pain and find out what they are then ask if he has a program to help people with opiate addiction My Dr helped me get a pain pump a machine that slowly delivers only 8 mlg of medication over 24 hrs He Has other pain alternatives and is careful to weed the drug seekers out little by little good luck If this pain is worse when driving or sitting long periods you may have a disc in the Ls such as L1 lumbar 1 the disc could be leaking or even gone and you have bone on bone in which case you are one tough individual I know that pain My surgery fixed that I woke in the recovery room telling anyone who listened my leg doesnt burn111 dONT SEE A ORTHOPEDIC DR A NEUROLOGIST that is atleast in the top ten will do He will likely offer alterior route that doesnt require narcotics Best of luck 7 years ago I started to experience pain in my right rib cage area Over the course of the next few months I had ultrasounds MRI xrays CT scans in addition to a number of treatments for pain that included light therapy and nerve blocks Finally I was diagnosed with postherpetic neuralgia without ever having experienced a rash breakout assocaited with shingles in that area It has now been almost 7 years and the pain in my rib cage remains Some days worse then others and almost alwasy worse with over activity Did not realize that you could even have PHN without having had the rash outbreak and still find myself searching for answers 7 years alongM I dont know the answer to this question but I would just call my pharmacist they are usually very good at answering questions regarding medications cortisone injections have helped me tremendously over the years I also had my nerve endings burned and that really made a big difference in the amount of pain I experience iim sorry to say you have flatworms most of tpain comes from the rightt side if you know your body real good Biltricide will clean up the tapeworm problem i know my whole family went threw this if it is discolored or painful seak help now Otherwise go see your normal doctor possibly a stomach virus or even at worst symptoms of Chrones disease if it is that bad have someone take you to a doctor hope you feel better you may want to look into Vertigo my mother was just diagnosed with this and had a lot of the same symptoms Shell go for days without an episode then all of a sudden shes dizzy off balance and she ended up hurting herself fairly badly when she fell and hit her head Id suggest going to the doctor asap if youre able  about an 7 Im not a doctor but based on experience and information my doctors and reading have given me I do know that potassium one of the 3 electrolytes along with magnesium and sodium chloride does effect the heart and when your body is low on potassium or magnesium it can cause muscle cramping or spasms Therefor it is possible that electrolyte imbalance could be the cause of back spasms When I had the imbalance it caused cramps spasms and pain in my legs and feet Any imbalance of electrolytes it a very serious condition and can lead to my medical issues including cardiac arrest and even death You should go to either the ER or your physician and get blood work done Best of luck Possibly Irlen Syndrome also known as Scotopic Sensitivity Syndrome Self test at irlencom you can also look up screeners in your area to find out Just 3 days ago I had the same occurance I had just logged into my computer and minutes later a pain struck the left side of my back right by my left kidney I tolerated it for 2 hours as I was in a training class the pain became more intense I figured it was just a spasm then maybe its my kidney as I had surgery in 2000 due to a 5 diameter hematoma and 3 months ago I was punched in the same kidney by my abusive husband I hobbled to my boss to inform him and that I could no longer endure the sharp throbs of torture He had me to grab my notebook to study at home but the extra 2lbs of weight was too heavy and I nearly lost my balance I was not allowed to drive myself home instead a manager dropped me at the nearest hospital After CT scans blood and urine work they could only diagnose me to have acute back pain gave me scripts for Lortab and Valium with a injection of Morphine and Benadryl from the outbreak of whelps where the IV was stabled discharged me home where i was bed ridden and slept away 2 days They gave me symptoms of what causes acute back ache since i didnt twist it it also stated from prolonged sitting35 weeks of sitting with 2 15 minute breaks and a half hour My back couldnt take another day so why cant this be considered  workers comp well they termed me for a 3 day absence with medical document which is 3 points but you have to have 12 to be termed humm lower back pain and front left pelvic area painIn the mornings hard to stand and walk urinating uncontrolled  neck pain leftsideafter walking around pain is lessbut not gonehard to stand up every morning drinking water it go right threw Icant make it to the

incresed symptoms after that procedure Constipation chestpain and unable to burp although I need to Great pressure builds up I feel like there is something tied around my neck I cannot eat meat or anything with real substance Just liquid and soft food like apple sauce This is horrible because it takes time to get over having it removed besides angina i also have shortness of breath and become light headness feel like im going to throw up numdness in my left leg tried all the timeblurred vision also you could have an kidney stone that wont pass without having minor surgerytalk to your doctor about doing this and also you need to have an renal altursound done to make sure that theres not any more kidney stones it sound like you are having what is called an angain attack you need to go to the ER and get it check out before it become a full heart attack The little one can easily get dehydrated If there is a high fever then probably call your dr The yellow green substance is bile and there is nothing in the childs stomach When my kids were like this we tried ice chips a few at a time sounds like pulled muscle strain if the pain persists after your menstrual cycle and more than two weeks with no workouts consult your doctor Another question the person who presented me the story is very distraught over his gf losing this baby they even named her He was not present for any appts has not seen any labs or ultrasound pic even though she states she had an ultrasound and has seen no positive pregnancy test basically he is going on her word I hate seeing him hurting like this and the circumstances surrounding are very suspicious He says she has 2 small incisions one by her bellybutton and one on her left side Is there medical documentation or anything he could ask for to prove her story Sounds like a UTI go see the Doc you need a gyno to tell you for sureUTIs can be dangerous please check it out soon not necessarily but you do want to stop activity and take you Blood Pressure yes GO in My mom had shingles hers didnt spread You are pregnant your body is not your own anymore i went to the hospital thinking my water broke  no I just peed a little I was humiliated guess what the hospital was not they would rather me and my child were better off safe than sorry Please go in and good luck to you Shingles according to my mom are very painful Also hers were on her back  i saw it had no idea first and felt it it was warm thankfully i didnt get it but I went to the doctor as I was very early pregnant I had it done a year ago and had pain until 6 months after the surgery I do still have stiffness in the knee if it stays in one place for long periods of time Do your prescribed exercises and you should start seeing the pain go away yes Asker herejust want to add she is a vegetarian but more of a vegan because she cooks for the family and one member is allergic to eggsdairy Lately we havent had the best vegetarian dietlots of pasta white rice But in April it seemed okay have you been checked for pleurisy It might be causing the pain in your chest I had pain in my left upper side took them forever to figure it out but meds made it all better exact same symptoms mine went on for years before it was properly diagnosed No I believe it makes back pain much worse For me anyway  Is there a reason you havent had the surgery to fix the trigger finger From my experience 8 years a COTA in hand therapy injections dont always work You may want to contact a hand specialist and discuss possible surgical options Dont know Dont know Dont know Dont know Dont know Dont know The main answer that I can think of is its your nerves It can be just stress related Have you been under more stress the past two or more months You could be suffering from anxiety andor depression and not even realize it No that does not mean that you are psychotic or look and behave just like the people in those antidepressant commercials either If you look those conditions up you may find many symptoms that match not just your pain but possibly other symptoms you may be experiencing too There is also the possibility that it could be nerve pain I suggest that you take some time to think about not just the pain you are feeling but also what other problems are you experiencing You should talk to your doctor about the pain and anything else that is bothering you andor maybe causing you to behave unusual to others around you You may also be having problems with circulation You should just go see your doctor an if youre the type to forget what you thought about wanting to ask then think about what you want to ask and discuss the day you set the appointment write it down or even write down everything you want to say and bring it with you Well I hope you do find out what is causing you that discomfort and get some relief If you want to you can let me know what you found out I think you should definitely see a doctor and I recommend you go to an Urgent Care or an Immediate Care facility the one that has an Xray machine on site Before you go I advise you to feel the effected area of your foot find the spot where it hurts the most then point your toes up  this may hurt but you want to find out whats wrong so you can really feel where the bones are and see if your most painful spot is on one of those bones If it is you could very likely have a hairline fracture a crack in the bone Im not a doctor but I have associated with people who had a hairline fracture and had to be put on crutches because if left untreated its likely to become a full fracture I hope you get it checked out as soon as possible and get well soon I had gastric bypass 42012 and I have had abdominal pain recurring and relieved off and on since November I was diagnosed with and umbilical hernia and also with abdominal adhesions You should talk to your doctor about the possibility of adhesions Mine are very painful when they hurt and the only relief is with narcotic pain meds none all medicines are processed through liver the liver is the bodys super filter it breaks down all the toxins the body doesnt wantneed anymore my uncle was not only an alcoholic but addicted to pain pills and patches and all opiates and his kidneys and liver threw in the towel and he diedbut if you take them as prescribed and stay away from alcoholic beverages you should be finejust remember you can live with one kidney or get a transfusion but liver is serious business unless youre mickey mantle migraines usually come with pain it could just be issues with your vision if its just light sensitivity but i highly recommend going to an eye doctor asap i have had my friend ignore migraines and unfortunately it turned out to a benign brain tumor when it comes to the braint of the human body it the most complicated suer computer in the world its all about finding the issue asap god forbid im sure you just need special lenses thats all but better safe then sorry This depends on your age stature and quantity of pain you should consult a pharmacist or physician as to a proper dosage for yourself while most people think it is selective to women only men can also get urinary tract infections UTI as well as bladder infections if this is the case either of which would explain all of your symptoms you need to see a physician and have a urine culture as well as a swab culture to confirm diagnoses an antibiotic will likely be prescribed and as always for kidney and bladder function 100 cranberry juice helps to maintain a healthy urinary system Could be costochondritis Is there any possibility that you could have pancreatitis I once had acute pancreatitis and those were some of my symptoms Also gastroesophageal reflux disease gerd can have those symptoms I would have to say a pain prescription from your dentist You can also try over the counter ibuprofen  The main symptom of pleurisy is pain in the chest This pain often occurs when you take a deep breath in or out or cough Some people feel the pain in the shoulderDeep breathing coughing and chest movement makes the pain worsePleurisy can cause fluid to collect inside the chest cavity This can make breathing difficult and may cause the following symptoms Bluish skin color cyanosis Coughing Shortness of breath Rapid breathing tachypnea Pleurisy may develop when you have lung inflammation

circlei can see it only when my penis is hard and it is really small so i thought i might call it a point It could be nerve pain I go through the same thing only in my right leg Mine is caused by a back injurypain that goes around my side down to my groin causing pain and continues all the way down to my feet Has your doctor ruled out TMJ There are many things that can cause these issues One is pregnancy Endometriosis could be the cause or you may be starting menopause I would suggest seeing your obgyn Sounds like pancreatitiswhen you have the pain go immediately to the doctor It is difficult for them to diagnose it unless you are having an attack My husband is experiencing the same thing The doctor told him when he has an episode go straight to the clinic and get a blood test and a scan He has a standing order for both You may want to ask your doctor for the same thing so the next time you have a flair up you can get the tests done that day If you are having pain in the area of your Gallbladder then you should go to the ER right away to have it checked out cause if it bursts you could die before getting help u possible can def see a doctor and untill you know whats going on i would stop running  try ice and heat packs to keep the pain down 20 min at a time if you see swelling ice if theres no swellling only pain heat   hope this helps feel better yes in a short and simple answer its very possible  when u say it was early how early because if u had sex in your ovulation time its possible ur having a baby if not then it possible that the sex brought on some bleeding  i would wait a good week and take a test  and try to be awear of your body if u notice differences then it can lead more to u being pregnant if not it possible u had some breakthough bleeding its normal to sometimes bleed early  was it heavy or light brownish  the back pain n cramping are also signs of implantion  the embro sticking to ur uerus if ur hoping for a baby i wish u luck n it sounds to me like u may b having one of not i hope everything ok  hope this helped u well only thing i can think of other than things like anti acids is milk drinking milk can really help  due to the fact its a natural anti acid also he could ahve acid reflucks  typo sry lol  for now tell him to drink the milk water even though it may seem like it would help wont and eatting to much at one time will also make it worse i would get him to start eatting little means and drinking more milk  and if that doesnt help him  knock him out n take to the doctor   with men thats the only way to get them to do what we want  lol also tell him that if left untreated it can burn through the lineing of your stomach and believe me cause i have acid refluks its more painful than he would think  i hope this helped and i hope ur husband feels better  i would go back to the er  dont wait for the doctor appt cause swelling is a bad problem he could have a knotted vien wrapped around his testicals which if left untreated can cause it to be cut out its common for dotors in the er to dismiss thing s not cause they dont care but at level of importnce being someone who got shot would have priority over ur son but if is getting worse n hes in pain go back to the er  tell them u have an appointment but ur sons in bad pain n cant wait  hope hes okay  n i hoped this helped sometimes you can have pains from your other tracks it is possible your intestines can give you pain if somethings wrong  also gas can give you sharp pains in your stomach but if it feels for sure like its in the same area as when you have your peroid it could be your blatter do you have anything out of the norm when you have your peroid does the pain come and go around the same time each time it happens either way if its stopping you from doing things i would go to your doctor and see what they can do to help you  hope this helped feel better  i would go to the doctor  it very possible that the shoulder pain can go down the arm  and since you cant move it all the more reason to go they can give you something for the pain and possibly phyiscal therepy to help you feel better untill then no more cat litter lifting and it can take a while for shoulder pain to go away so take it easy as much as you can hope this helpes and feel better  sounds like it could also be kindey stones  either way if the pain gets worse or of u begin to have pain when u pee call the doctor  if u have fear to go maybe justa consult can let u know weither its something to go in for  hope u feel better no thats something different  that kind of charley horse is due to the lack of air in your mussel  its a from of rigamortis the same chemical that makes your body stiff when ur dead  what happens is you legs use the air in your blood to constrict the mussel when ur running  i was in track myself as a kid and this happen to me as well when u push the body beyond its limits the mussel when then use a chemical  sorry i dont remember the name in place of air  because your body hasent enough air at that time to forfill the need this cause the stiffness it like i said really a from of rigamortis  pretty cool huh its normal to feel stiff for a bit  i felt very sore for a day or so after  it happend to me durning a race which im happy to sya i had won  its nothing to worry about  i hope this answerd your question your mouth is full of nerves and just because you have pain in one place doesnt mean thats where its coming from i would make a check up with your dentest if it doesnt let up  and infection can live in your gums  which is very bad since it can cause an abcest which can go into the spin and brain if left untreated can lead to death  on the lighter side a little meds can clear that right up  hope you feel better and hope this helped  never heard f that before i would say its more likely to be the other way around if u have a abcess you should go to your dentist they can be life threatning if left untreated for a while the infection can go into your brain in short and cause your brain to shut down which ends in death your mouth most people dont think to take care of but remember its the closest thing to your brain  finish your meds by the doctor and go to the dentist its possible that the anti b they gave you wont help whats going on in your mouth they work on a different part of the body hope this helps depending on how bad it can go from headaches  toothaches blurred vision in very bad cases  inablity to focus  finfing it hard to think pain in your jaw due to something like your cervical spine not being in the right place ex reversed cervical spine which causes the bones to be as it says in the name reversed which i myself have and its very painfull after you spine curves more than a 20 degree angle in the wrong direction  also things like bad posture can cause neck pain  if you sit on front of a computer for a long tome each day i hope this helps you  i have had trouble with my shoulder for many years after 8 years which was way to long i had lost all movement it was like having a dead arm  i also had poppingmy advice is go to the doctor have them do an xray seeing what you did its likely then will recommend some excersies for you to do  dont try to move your arm move then it will go without pain cause if you let this go and done take care of it  it can get really bad i had to have reconstruction surgery and my arm will never be the same theres alot things i cant do now that i may have been able to if i would have taken care of it from the start you dislocated your should is what it sounds like  i myself have had that happen many times  it is also possible that all the pain your still have cause its normal to have pain for a while but when the pain begina to move through out your back and arm its possible it didnt go back in correctly  i would go to see the doctor dont let it go untreated i left my shoulder untreated for 8 years long story short in the end i had a dead arm couldnt use it and had to have reconstruction surgery believe me it wasent fun and ill never have the same movement again im sure the doctor will gove you something for the pain do an xray possible mri if he feels its bad enough and have you do some pt phyical therapy hope this helps also try not to move your arm to much untill you know what going on  and dont try to move it in a area that causes more pain what the first person is right but i want to add if this pain contiunes you shoud talk to your doctor about phyical therapy because if left untreated could become a big problem i didnt have that shoulder problem i had an everything kinda shoulder problem cant remember what it was called but i can tell you i had to have a total reconstruction surgery and ill never use my arm the same way again so just try to get it looked at before it becaomes a real problem hope this also helps yes its always possible if you had unprotected sex  and your late you could be  they say its not always a sure thing to take a hpt the first day of your peroid  tests like clear blue are normaly on the money  cramping can be from the egg attaching itself inside you  i would say try another test in a few days see what that tells you if still a neg call you gyn and let her know and im sure she can tell you if its something to worry about  also bare in mind that if you did have sex and your having pain in your side you could be having a tube pregnancy which means the egg has attached itself to you tube rather than making its way into where it belongs and that can be a very bad thing  so like i siad hold off a few days but if the pain worsens call your doctor asap  hope this helps you need to see an experienced doctor to give you the turn your head and cough while he is squeezing your testes seems like a forgotten art in the medical world make sure he knows his business and is honest take the time to tell him exactly whats going on in your life and body like any accedents or exercises that may have contributed to your condition I should have went to med school think carefully and be very honest and exact Beg him to be honest and sincere make sure he earns his money have you tried herbal douches like slippery elm myrhh maybe goldenseal  you will have to mix it yourself I recommend a book called  Back to Eden by Jethro kloss it is a great book Find a good herbal store and find someone who knows herbs HERBS HERBSHERBS find a good naturopath herbal practioner someone who is experienced with herbal remidies A good book for herbal remedies

plants themselves tree barks research research get R done  HERBS  Maybe a good antiseptic herb like mryhh Goldenseal slippery elm douche research herbal remedies for yourself or find a good herbal book like Back to eden by jethro kloss or find a good herbal person I suffer from leg pain and leg cramps The pain level is 9plus My pain is every day most before bed time did you find out what the problem was I am dealing with the same pain i had something similar keeps recuring as well question if you breath out when you move asround doses it stop hurtin as much A gastroenterologist general surgeon or a doctor of internal medicine My suggestion would be the gastroenterologist Did you have a TURP done If so you could have some bleeding still and need to contact your doctor Maybe an ESWL procedure It is a noninvasive procedure in which you would be sedated the entire time It would break up the stone Other than that perhaps laser lithotripsy with stent placement My father is actually going through a very similar scenario currently His next options after the epidural blocks and steroid blocks is surgery I believe his two choices for surgery is a fusion vs removal of the bulging disc It sounds like it most likely related to your ovary on that side It is possible that you may have a cyst that is causing your discomfort It is also possible that it could be your appendix but seeing as how you have had the pain going on for 3 weeks and are otherwise asymptomatic that is unlikely Some pain and swelling postop is normal However being 2 months out I would recommend you go see your ortho surgeon who performed the surgery to rule out any complications Personally I would get a second opinion Im sure that he was right that your prostate was ok but he didnt elaborate into any of the other symptoms or give you any sort of possible explaination If you feel that he often pushes you out of the office it may be best to find a different doctor Feel free to ask when you make an appt how long the doctor allows for each patient then pick one who takes a longer time with their patients Until you see a doctor again make sure you are getting enough fiber in your diet Fruits vegetables and whole grains will make having a bowel movement much easier Good Luck I would think it could happen but probably not to the extent of the ripping of childbirth More like a small cut caused by extra streching of the labia Most likely it is like any small cut and you can help it heal by keeping the area clean especially after sex The stinging is caused by the fluids getting into the cut and it will probably sting a bit when you clean it as well To prevent this as much as posiible make sure you are use enough lubrication and that your not to vigorous in that position Its time to go back to the doctor It is possible that the antibiotic you were given was not strong enough or you werent on it long enough It could even be that you need a different antibiotic Go to the doctor before it gets worse I would agree that this could be hypoglycemia or at least hypoglycemia can cause this symptom Id recommend getting your husband to a doctor I know that is easier said than done sometimes This issue and the chest pain should be looked at Just schedule a regular physical and inform the doctor of these symptoms Good Luck It cant be good Your losing all your iron  see a doctor You might have fibroid tumors By ratchets do you mean movement or sound of the joint Is the pain in the shoulder joint or around the shoulder blade When you sleep what position is your shoulder ie toward you chest or back or with you arm under you and straight I have Neuropathy and my doctor wanted to do this but stated that it is a 5050 chance that it would work My wife is a nurse and she asked about this with doctors she assists at the hospital and they stated the same and also the pain usually returns Take him to a doctor as soon as possible Ticks carry lyme disease Better safe than sorry Yesit can cause pressure on nerves and cause pain It may just be that you need to change your mattress Taking him to the ER might be a good idea My brother played football and never reacted like that after a badhard tackle if you dont want to go to the ER at least consider a walk in clinic I have experienced gas abdominal pain and soft bowel movements with Irritable Bowel Syndrome or IBS I have never had Gastric Bypass but I would consider talking to the doctor that performed that surgery as he might want to do imaging studies to rule out intestinal problems I have heard people say they experienced problems with gas after the GB Interstitial Cystitis is inflammation in the ureters urethra bladder etc It can cause nausea abdominal crampingpain spasms and possible urine leakage For me the symptoms are almost exactly like a urinary track or bladder infection including pain pressure and the feeling like I still have to urinate right after voiding If your symptoms are interfering with your life then I would suggest talking with your doctor about how heshe can help you better manage your symptoms I have intense symptoms for a few daysweek then it calms down and Im not aware of it at all Usually I wait for it to calm down on its own however there are medications to relax the organs and muscles involved There are many reasons why you could have stomach pain after eating and nausea Some diagnosis are serious and need medical attention right away I would schedule an appointment with your doctor ASAP Be prepared with a complete list of symptoms and see if you can identify potential triggers ie certain foods beverages time of day frequency duration etc The more information you can provide your doctor up front the faster he might be able to give you a diagnosis and treatment Im wondering why this appears under Ulcer Have you been diagnosed with Ulcers before I had Endometriosis before a radical Hysterectomy I remember doubling over in pain and it did affect my ability to have a bowel movement You need to be seen by a doctor right away I know you dont want to because of finances but I suggest you go anyway Did they perform a radical Hysterectomy or partial The only way you could be having problems with Endometriosis is if they performed a partial Hysterectomy I finally had to have a radical meaning they took both ovaries as well as the uterus Once this is done you cannot have Endometriosis again I used to get bad blood clots that looked like what you are describing The fact that you have an IUD and your having pelvic pain I would contact your doctor immediately Its fairly rare but you could be having complications from the IUD Please do not wait to see your doctor If you cannot get into the one that gave you the IU then see your primary care physician If the pain becomes unbearable then go to your local ER  I have pain in my right calf I had an ultra sound and it showed a blood clot try yoga the problem may not originate in your knee at all it may be from some other alignment issue in another part of your body that is the case for me with my knee pain it comes from my hips and other alignment issues i have also play a role the body is all one In my view you must look at the whole rather than just a part Yoga practice helped me to identify where in my body needs work I hope this helps Good luck Have you tracked what you have eaten prior to this new pain gall bladder not withstanding You could have had a latent viral infection of the Facial nerve nucleus such as by the varicella zoster virus that could have then been activated either by the trauma of the surgery or any medications given afterwards There is no connection whatsoever between the Plantar Nerves and the Facial Nerve Hi You are not alone Believe me There are others dealing with the same issues I had migraines for about a month I could not eat because then Id throw up could not be in the light could not even go outside Each and everytime that I went outside Id throw up The light bothered me and made my migraines worse as well as the noise and the TV There are good meds out there on the market for that You just have to experience with them to see which one helps you to the most I too saw my neurologist for my migraines he gave me a script but it did not help very much Those migraines are a killer Id cry because I could not eat or keep anything down It did started with an aura And mind you I was outside waiting on the metro rail stop when this happened I sort of had a feeling like kind of oooze So I called my DR and he told me to get to the nearesr ER And they told me it was migraines And I was just constantly throwing up left and right at the ER Have you checked with a spine specialist or chiropractor Absolutely they can I would recommend going to a chiropractor I had a similar problem about a year ago and went to my chiropractor He took an Xray and found that my lower disc had not formed properly I lift weights and over the years it had taken its toll The disc had slipped causing extreme pain in my lower back that would shift on occasion from left to right He treated me for a couple weeks and realigned the disc No cure for me other than surgery so I have just cut back on lifting heavy and changed some of my exercises Have you tried kicking him out They say if you love someone set them free and see what happens In his case youre just giving him back to mother nature for diagnosis Have you ever been tested for endometriosis From what youre describing it seems like a distinct possibility to me No Talk to your doctor to see if its your liver causing the pain If its muscular or your ribs themselves causing the pain you may be able to garner some relief through the use of an orthopedic rib belt such as this one httpwwweganmedicalcomRibBeltporbs344100htm  Sorry I forgot to finish the link off If in fact it is either the ribs themselves or the muscle tissue surrounding them a rib belt may help provide some relief Go see a doctor If a vet can deal with worms adequately Im sure a physician can too if you have had an injury there could be a blood clot Even without injury could be a blood clot especially if you a more sedantary lifestyle My rotator cuff tear was undiagnosed for 10 years  Ive also had three Left knee surgeries  My point is your body is not going to get better by itself And get all of your questions answered and write them down in case you wish to get a second opinion have you tried to swaddle her My kids always woke themselves up by twitching in their sleep and hitting themselves We got a swaddle blanket and it worked wonders You could use a regular receiving blanket Open the blanket up and lay flat fold in half diagonally so you have a large triangle put baby so her shoulders are slightly above the longest side this should be the center of the blanket tuck the point of the triangle into her feet wrap the right side in all the way over her and under if you have that much slack making sure that her arm is inside the blanket then do the same to the other side making sure again that her arm is under the blanket It keeps them from swatting themselves and may keep them sleeping longer Good luck Not a doctor but a mother of 3 at this age they dont have much you should try a home remedy like prune juice you should only use a very small amount at a time their systems react more quickly to things You probably broke your tailbone Ive done the same it really hurts but is not serious but call your doctor just in case  I sounds like he damaged the ligaments under the knee Which only hurts when you pressure on the knee like kneeling of touching He should get it checked out soon The longer he waits the worse it will become because of inflammation under the knee This will cause the knee to eventually lock in a slight bent position and then it will be difficult to move and that is something that you do not want Although I am not a doctor I will say this My husband had a similar problem and was told to limit use to allow muscles to mend but you will need to do some physical therapy to regain control and strength after a few weeks of healing It really depends on how bad you have injured the muscles as to if they will heal or not Listen to your orthopedic physician as they usually are correct I would ask you if you have been under a great deal of stress recently It sounds like the pain most people get from having an ulcer If you have been under a lot of stress it is quite possible that you have an ulcer in your intestines causing the pain I recommend talking to your doctor and asking if you should have an upper GI test done If you have ulcers you can cure them by taking Slipper Elm Bark pills found at your local natural foods store One per day should be good unless you have more than one ulcer If this is the case take one with each meal for a couple of weeks for either doseage I recommend the pills over surgery If you cant swallow pills the stuff comes in a pwder form that you can mix into a hot beverage or put in a food that can mask the taste It does not have a pleasant flavor  Also RELATED to the above question I have not had a period since before my last pregnancy which has been 18 months with no period and no signs whatsoever of having a period or that it is coming Whenever you have significant physical trauma that results in an injury inflammation will occur on the site where the most impact occurred When inflammation happens some people will develop a low grade 999 oral temperature fever due to the body working hard to heal itself Sweating could be contributed to such a fever as you are warmer than usual you have chest pain you should get an examination by your physician While it isnt lasting throughout the day it is concerning and there are several reasons that could explain why it is happening Instead of guessing or doing nothing at all please follow up with your personal care provider and get examined no could it be radiculopathy You need to see your doctor The pain is most likely musculoskeletal pain caused by the MVA which can be from hitting your chest on something or by muscle spasms BUT in saying that without being able to examine you theres no way for me to definitively say that its simply from the MVA ANY time someone has chest pain no matter for how long they should always see their doctor right away Hives or rash Hives is a dangerous symptom to have and a doctor should be consulted Stomach pain could be many different problems Tramadol or Ultram is a nonnarcotic pain reliever that may help but a prescription is needed These symptoms seems related to asthma or COPD A doctor should be consulted Another possibility could be sleep apnea do you snore while sleeping It too is an issue that needs professional attention I think when you have a new symptom and especially pain you should see a doctor Yes Especially having to go to the bathroom a lot The sooner you know if youre pregnant the better Yes they have done urine tests blood tests CAT scan etc They cant seem to find anything wrong other than vaginosis Vaginosis could be another cause Most definitely I would see my dr immediatelyor if notthen call 911 or go to your nearest er bc these could either be potential symptoms of a heart attack or a stroke Ive been a physical therapist for over 25 years For some reason people still think that massage and ultrasound is primarily what we use for treatment That may have been true 20 or 30 years ago but the therapists I know and have worked with in recent years do very little ultrasound especially for neck pain Most massage has been turned over to massage therapists as well We often use a lot of specific exercise techniques to stretch or strengthen the region manual techniques like joint mobilizations or manipulation etc We do use both mechanical and manual traction some electrical modalities dry needling taping and other techniques We also use heat or cold but to categorize what our profession does these days as heat ultrasound and massage what we disparaging call a HUM job is illinformed and insulting i would think it would be seince it is right there ask your doctor I had a close friend who had same problem with her son who at time was 3 years old now 5 years old I told her to give him Lactose and Glucotin free foods stop all daily vitamins he might be taking Pedlite that first thing in the morning small 4oz to start with Decrease all spices in his food to almost none No fried food at all If you go to your grocery market get the Gerber Graduates for him but dont let him see it cause hes a big boy not a baby and will not eat if he sees the baby food jar Best of luck to you and your son I had to raise my friends son for almost 2 years cause she couldnt handle him being in pain with or without food So me being in medical field and having 5 medical degrees didnt mind hes all better now and back with his momma now shoulder pain problems shoulder pain problems Yes I had shingles at one point but mine didnt hurt it only itched really bad but I was taking ibprofin 3 times a day for a staff infection So if she is on any antiflammitory meds it may be keeping her from feeling any pain Really good question The incidence of nonsexual teens is probably pretty low in this day and time But yes God bless them It happens I think you have to address the cramping first obviously Lots of possible causes Again I say you start at the most obvious cause and work your way back to the most obscure With girls cramps are most commonly due to menes blood flowing thru the cervix clots hurt more The cervix which is the distal end of the uterus which extends down into the vag is very sensitive to stuff going thru it dilating it Thats why clots hurt more than just thin blood Some doctors from my experience over the years have used BC pills to control blood flow down the uterus to the vag Im not a girl but Ive been married twice and I have 2 daughters One started her periods at age 8 Very cruel joke from mother nature Both my wives had endometriosis and had bleeding problems Cramps were an everyday occurence So was overflow bleeding Geez I felt so bad for my girls Nothing prepares a girl for that Gone are the days when girls cramps were written off by professionals as nerotic I know it hurts Altho some girls tend to be drama queens who actually knows how bad it hurts except them Historically BC pills a cocktail of hormones I think seem to reduce blood loss Also affects weight gain Bigger boobs too Fluid retention Lovely But my answer to your direct question is if its BC pills then yes it COULD help with the cramps And who knows or wants to know if theyre sexually active Just put them on the pillhope for the best If it doesnt work with the cramps let them know they should tell you so you can seek other answers Parenting is tough especially with girls This is my best answer To my knowledge there are 5 types of herpestype viruses Herpes type 1 is cold sores Type 2 is sexually transmitted as in genital Type 3 I believe is chicken pox Type 4 is herpes zoster which is shingles Not sure but I dont believe any of these would cause joint pains The only one I dont know about is type 5 CMV Cytomeglovirus Not sure about the spelling but thats close enough for you to do a google searchor a webMD search Hope this helps Hell no Sciatica pain is the result of the sciatic nerve which travels down the hip down the backside of the femur Has nothing to do with the knee joint Its a nerve impigment at the hip level But it does hurt down the backside of the thigh Its caused by the sciatic nerve which travels down thru the piraforma muscle in the butt muscle which entraps it Its very painful and very common Doesnt sound like an ACL so much More like either a Bakers cyst or an aneurysm I dont know much about Bakers cysts but thats where they happen Could also be a ganglion cyst Ive seen aneurysms though Get it fixed By the way get a good doctor Apparently the surgical approach is important Just learned that recently for the Bakers Cyst Get a second opinion The lateral approach could end with tingling down the lateral aspect of the lower leg Small town doctor versus a big city doctor Just what I was told All due respect A PE Pulmonary Embolism is probably resolved by now with the use of Coumadin Youd know if it wasnt Youd be dead Its probably something else The blood test Ddimer is a blood test which is a marker for a desolving clot In my opinion you have another pathology thats restricting blood flow to your brain Id advise to have a CTA of the brainneck to diagnosis a plaque deposit in the carotid arteries Dont know your age Id also advise a nuclear stress test or a heart cath This is to rule out heart muscle disease Lightheadedness has a bunch of possibilities Almost as many as headaches or abdominal pain Start at the most common causes and work your way back to the most obscure It could be as simple as panic attacks or as obscure as a some congenital defect Probably something in between An EKG is usually resting You need a stress test Heart tests are more accurate under stress Geez what the heck are you kids doing Ok besides the testicular torsion dx Id consider the more chronic problems of varicocele  a varicose vein in the the scrotum and a hydrocele Theyre not that uncommon These body parts are kinda special and I wouldnt be tying twine around them Historically there is not that great of blood circulation in the scrotum Thats why chemo is not so great in getting down to that place BTW anything that has to do with the scro you need to quit it Just saying Hip replacements have come a long way in 13 years Ive seem a couple of total hips come out of socket in my days Ive even helped a few orthopods reduce dislocations That means I helped them put them back in Id say get a lawyer as these things are prone to happen If you could only see what Ive seen In my limited opinion the early hip replacements were an exercise in lets see what happens All I can say is its a work in progress But dont condeme them When anything is new its never perfect Its the chance you take I had 2 wives and they both had entrometriosis This is where the endrometrium or the lining of the uterus spills out into the abdominal cavity and takes root like a vine in your landscape Not saying this is your problem but its pretty common and its pretty serious The common side effect was painful and pronounced menes We were lucky to have a good doctor who did laprosopic surgeries to burn the implants with my second wife to manage her implants We went about 3 years at one point between laps because she didnt have any symptoms but one day she started pissing pure bloodwith no pain Turns out it had grown around her right ureter and choked off her right kidney killing it Long story short she lost her right kidney and her uterus in one surgery So dont fool around with it Whether its your disease or not just keep it in mind Read all you can about this disease I also have a daughter that started her menes at 8 years old Way too soon obviously Still havent figured that out yet Read all you can Good luck Probably because 18mm is equal to 18 cm and 1 cm is equal to 254 inches Sooooo 18 cm is almost equal to 5 inches It wouldnt be in the urinary system or it wouldve killed you by now Reread your report and get a second opinion Calcifications are common anywhere within the human body most are benign But thats still a big calcification Itd be odd if a radiologist saw a hugh calcification but didnt say where All sounds fishy to me Get your report and get a second opinion Youre probably alright something went awry you should see a dermatologist I am a professional tattoo artist and in all my training I have never heard of this you cant inject that much ink and it doesnt synch up with scar formation or normal infections Most likely an irritant got into your skin via your fresh tattoo could be environmental or from an insect best to have a doctor look Before I had my pump installed I was on 500 mg Kadian  which is a form of morphine and had already been on many other opiates before that My pain pump implanted in my abdomen with tubing going up my spine and ultimately in to my brain has been pumping 10 mg of morphine during a 24 hour period for five years Withdrawals from the pump has kicked me down If I had to do this again I would insist I go to some type of rehab because I dont think coming off an opiate should be done without a lot of help from a doctor Ive had two children and that pain doesnt compare to the pain Im going through now from Morphine withdrawals Drinks lots of water and get a doctors help or help from a rehab center You could look into the possibility of a gluten or wheat allergy since many high fiber foods contain gluten andor wheat Otherwise try something that relieves gas as high fiber diets can cause gas buildup No No No PAINFUL ALWAYS ESPECIALLY IF TOUCHED Period issueare you menopausal or could be I would research effects of various stomach problemsperiod issues on net in case it is caused by some food issue Also antibiotics will do thisprobiotics might fix Yogurt and other food with good bacteria might help Have you tried gas removal things like GasX Hey you never knowno insurance here so I try everything I can before seeing Drso expensive Good luck It is entirely possiblebut most of the people I know with this issue have it caused by herniated disc pressing on nerve Research how this can be helped on net but consider surgery your last option 3 of the 4 people I know who have had got goodmoderate relief and 4th person has had several more surgeries Good luck Your symptoms arent very specific What side is the pain on and is it high or low what other symptoms I would need more information to tell you what is going on I would say if you are older you might be getting arthritis If it continues to bother you talk to your physician What you are describing kind of sounds like irritable bowel syndrome It is easily affected by what you eat hence the mucous in the stool after eating certain foods My recommendation would be to stop eating the foods that cause the symptoms That way you arent damaging your body and not making yourself sick A lot of foods that cause symptoms with IBS are foods that are greasy cheesy or sugary Hope this helps Even tho you dont have any sinus problems most headaches are sinus related Best thing to do is try to lay down and relax quietly untill the pain passes Over straining or even continuing with normal activites will mostly make the pain prolonged have u had a colonoscopy what took place before having this prob sounds more like colitis need colonoscopy to confirm pt has diabetes Maybe you should take a pregnancy test anyway maybe spotting Also might depend on your age assuming you are young maybe you are pregnant If you are older say menopause age maybe you periods are slowing down Just a couple of thoughts Good luck I have had partially torn archilles for 8 years by doing stretching of the calf 8 times a day I can play tennis with no pain Hi As a person with no medical knowledge what so ever but a person that has overdosed on Tylenol many times I would get it checked out immediately Tylenol is horrible for your liver and you could have damaged it Addition I know I need help but my parents wont take me to the doctor I dont know what else to do you should probably go see a doctor and make sure you take a sample of that with you so that the doctor can check that outadn if he cant help you then i dont know what you could do I had pain for over a decade Hard getting out of bed and going to bed Cold weather and dampness increases it My PCP recommended I move to Floridawarmer climate Sounds great but really UghhhhDoctors didnt know what else to do with me Jokingly I replied just take me out to the pasture and shoot me I felt helpless I felt no one believed me Very frustrating Been thru so many tests lots of xrays blood work etc The most reliable test would be an MRI and nerve conduction tests Not happy with the dx but I have Fibromyalgiasomething that is not easily detected or believed by med providers It is something I have to deal with for the rest of my life All one can do is take it one day at a time Always thank the Lord for another day I wish you well God bless you and yours Hello I am not a doctor but i can help a bit You did not specify as to whether or not you had protected or unprotected vaginal sex Protected vaginal sex puts you at a low risk where as unprotected vaginal sex puts you at a high risk of contracting HIV There are no clinical symptoms associated with HIV This means that no consistent physical symptoms have been observed among people with HIV With that being said some infected individuals do experience a strong flulike illness 23 weeks post exposure and this last for about 810 days However some infected individuals experience no symptoms at all The World Health Organization guidelines consider all testing to be conclusive at 3 months So make sure to get tested after 4 weeks have trouble empty my bladder I pee an strain an then pee again I get really tired have had viral chf sine 2000 yes i would go 2 the er eyes are not something 2 play with Fractured tailbone There is nothing they can do about it I have fractured mine a few times it is NO fun  I did not like Requip It made my thinking very fuzzy I accidently found that quinine worked with no side effects I found it at Walmart in health type supplements for restless legs hopefully you have seen a doctor about this strain if it seems serious it may be a torn muscle and may cause other problems Mistreating an abdominal strain either by icing or stretching wrong could be fatal speak to a doctor before treating a sprain   i have had ALOT of kidney stones and the pain was always in my lower back What do you mean by right side Your abdomen If so maybe you should see a specialist It could be something gastrointestinal or related to diet No bipolar disorder doesnt directly cause her to steal meds but the illness can cause her to not care that she is doing this activity She needs to be under better care for her illness and taking medication So many people who suffer mental illnesses dont always take their medications There are those who abuse even their own medications She does need help I have migraines often and they do not always come with pain I have auras and when I have these I do not have pain Auras are pretty nasty in their own right Weird funky lines in the peripheral vision I will feel slightly off kilter and they can last from a few seconds to several minutes but I never get the headache when I get these I have had all kinds of work ups for this and that is what it boils down to My migraines are from my neck arthritis and they are fierce when they hit so having just visual manifestations are just fine by me Birth control pills estrogen and progesterone are powerful and potentially dangerous drugs and should not be used for period cramping unless there is a clear need These drugs have very severe side effects and should not be taken lightly Birth control pills can cause blood clots liver cancer gallbladder disease heart attacks acne oily scalp hair loss high blood pressure depression cataracts and many many other side effects You are probably just catching the muscle quickly compressing it and then releasing it The muscle can become injured and stay sore for quit a while Try to avoid bending in that manner for a while and try some heat compresses I have had 4 done twice bilaterally Pain stopped within a couple of months the first time The second operations not so good New EMG NCV reveal that the carpal tunnel is still there and the left is minor the right is moderate to severe Oh well I dont think I will have again Over extension or overuse of the muscle not a good idea Charley Charlie Horse is muscle that is telling you that it doesnt have enough oxygen or other necessary chemicals to work properly You could damage your muscles by not listening to your bodies indication that something is wrong Muscle can bleed and this can cause a lot of pain You need to rest the muscle that is in pain not push it further You have chronic pain conditions and yes you can have concomitant ailments or diseases Concomitant simply means at the same time in addition to and so on Some can be related to each other and at other times not Many of those of use with severe osteoarthritis have fibromyalgia and or myfascial pain which they call syndromes Syndrome always sounds questionable to me Fibromyalgia until very recently was not even considered to be a real ailment It was one of those all in your head deals They are now discovering that there are real changes occurring It is time for Pain Management see a pain specialist You dont say if you have any other symptoms Do you have hand or arm symptoms This will tell you if it is local to your neck or now systemic involving your arms and hands Sometimes the numbness and tingling and pain are only one sided and sometimes they can be bilateral Have you had an MRI or just plain xray to diagnose Lot of things may have to happen MRI if you havent had one EMGNCV I have had many and doubt their sensitivity and pain specialist They may send you for PT and if that doesnt work then they may try injections RFA radiio frquency ablation even Botox I have done it all and in the end Botox was the only thing that worked for the muscle painspasms See your doctor Ovary or ovulation pain can be felt in the top of your thigh down to your knee There are nerves running through the abdomen which innerviate your internal abdomen then they run down the top of the leg Migraine should always be assessed by your doctor I suffer migraine like headaches and yes I sometimes get aura and no head pain The periphriel vision contains fractured appearance almost like looking through broken panes of glass I get severe chronic head pain from my cervical spine osteoarthritis The small nerves rami become compressed and head pain can last for me anywhere from a few hours to the longest of 13 days One difference is that no medication works to treat mine the best way is avoidance and stress which stiffens the shoulder and neck muscles begin the process of compression at the paraspinal muscles I have in the past had Botox injections for these the last working for two years Little girls at that age well frankly her wiring is completing and she may be feeling a pleasurable sensation when rubbing the clitoris Its fine its normal and nothing to worry about Osteoarthritis in the hip generally is felt in the groin area the outside of the hip could indicate bursitis And this can be chronic You would need an xray though to rule out the possibility of OA Lidocaine is a topical analgesic it is a pain killer and really has no properties to cure anything it just makes it feel better while it heals Plantar Fasciitis is definitely associated with arch pain Typically you will have intense pain when you wake up in the morning and your foot or feet hit the floor The fascia does not stretch and when you sleep your feet naturally go into a neutral position which is pointing downward and when you first step on the floor that fascia is stressed with that first step I have had this in the past and in both feet It is very painful to walk to the point where you may not be able to walk Because there are so many tick born ailments I think its important that you watch her closely for the next week or so Make sure you take temp 2xs a day and watch for rashes anywhere on the body Fluid in the ear is most annoying and can be damaging to your ear I caution you though about the decision to have tubes put in the ear drum to drain this fluid I had tubes in for about 2 years they fell out I actually had the little tiny plastic rings They are less tubes than just little rings of plastic Most often the ear drum heals itself after the tubes fall out mine did not I now have very tiny holes in my ear drums this is a problem I cannot swim in a lake for fear the water will enter into the ear and this water can carry many nasty little bugs viruses bacteria and so on Many lakes in my area end up at one time or another have to be closed to swimmers due to high bacteria counts ecoli is just one of the many things that can be found in lake water You do not want this to fester in your ear FibromyalgiaMyfascial causes bands of tough tissue to develop for me its been around my joints To push through is not a wise idea rather you should push to because you will help break this up but to push through may cause more damage to your soft tissues muscles and tendons If you are sedentary you should never begin an exercise routine with emphasis on no pain no gain ever You need to speak with your doctor and a physiotherapistchiropractor devise a plan of exercise that takes into account your muscular and skeletal weaknesses and work around them it will take longer but it will also be a smarter way to achieve your goals Slow and steady will win this race You dont want to pile injury on top of FM SooboobIve got the same symptoms  spent a week in one hospital  a week later a week at another hospital while drs were trying to figure out what was causing the extreme nausea that was sooo forceful it made me dry heave but never a true vomiting The only thing they found after extensive examining with every kind of MRI ultrasound CT scan  lab u can think ofwas a golfball size tumor in the center of my liver Ive read several threads of people with tumors in their liver that claim to have the same symptoms  their dr would never attribute the symptoms to the tumor I had my gallbladder removed 2 yrs ago  started having the nausea April of last yr  the pain started as an occasional painsimilar to the gallbladder pain but grew in intensity  frequency over a several month period Im a woman  notice that the pain is at its peek a week before my cycle starts PMS  during my cycle then it subsides to tolerable  the nausea increases to intolerablethey take turns ruining my day LOL Hope this isnt whats wrong with u but your symptoms are the same as mine  ALL the drs Ive seen are too eager to hand me the IBS med  Nexiumhowever the meds make the pain worse You could have ectopical pregnancy which means youre pregnant outside the uterus maybe the tubes Go see your obgyn so they will take a blood test to see whats going on Maybe you are allergic to the massage oilcream that are causing the welts and irritations As far as feeling fatigue and joint pain thats what deep tissue massage does but then you should feel better within the next two days If its really severe fatigue andor pain then the therapist is going at it too harddeep for your condition I would talk to your Dr maybe something else going on Allopathic system believes that genital herpes is incurable It has been discovered that natural remedies help to prevent recurrent outbreaks by boosting immune system The first outbreak of herpes can last for several weeks The first outbreak usually is the most painful and takes the longest to heal Another outbreak can appear after weeks or months the first appeared but in most of the cases it is always less severe and shorter than the first one Surgery stress vigorous sex unbalanced diet are some of the triggers reported probly not but just talk to your md consult you md about your pinis glands put for to not have a hangover take an asprin an water consolt her kids md no defrise one costs more and is beter qualady ask your doctor about apace maker Stiffness in neck when really bad cannot bend neck in any direction Feels swollen affects jaw and ears Causes tightness in muscles of cranium and pain and stiffness from area of neck near the base of cranium and spine  Very stiff and horrid pressure in mid to upper spine is a main contributor as well Hearing loss in right ear is almost completeLeft ear is losing hearing as well Every nerve on my upper torso muscular rigidity or atrophy happens in both shoulders with pain running under armpits causing numbness in both arms Confusion the inability to speak is very frustrating When I feel frustrated with this pain I cannot express any emotion almos like I am in a walking coma Nerves on my skin hurt so much it is painful to shower All the while my neck continues to stay stiff and feel like a knuckle feels when it needs to pop and sometimes the neck does pop but it isnt the bones that pop its the muscles that pop Right before they pop the muscles in the neck sound rusty Yes they make a sound like an old leather baseball glove would make if you opened or closed the glove Last but not least the taste in my mouth is horrendous It feels like the nerves in my mouth have been muted or are hurt stinging some way I dont know if the taste is coming from the drainage from my right ear Which gets filled with so muhch pressure the ear drum breaks chronically and then heals up until pressure gets bad again While the ear drum is still unbroken the drainage runs down my throat making my throat sore and giving me that horrible taste and stinging in my mouth  If it was a severe PE then you will know when your lungs start breathing at full capacity again Sometimes you dont really know when its gone Your best fight against PEs and making sure they will not hurt you and will desinigrate is making sure your PTINR is always and I mean always at a theraputic better to waste someones time than your life go see someone I would give it a little while Since you are walking it isnt broken but your feet have more tendons in them than muscle mass you likely bruised some tendons Internal bruising can take several months to heal Keep off your feet as much as possible elevation is good too multiple problemssee your doctor not just one try castor oil every time after bath for itchiness benadryl for allergiesask your doctor about restless leg symptomscould be a problem with leg nerveshiccups ussually is trapped air chew your food slowerno carbonation for a daysee if that helps varicose veinssee your doctor

had a cist on her ovarie that burst during sex if i touch it it hurts even worse I woke up a lot last night because it hurt so bad do you clench your jaw when you are stresed or while you sleep Might have a herniated disk like I had once It hurts terribly u mentioned so less symptomsanyhow with such possibilities cholecystitis is quite possible appendicitis or could be ibs Gas and anxiety is another form of chest discomfort I too battled migraines for 4 months After several different meds that did not work I came to the realization that the one thing that had changed in my life prior too was my cell phone I quit using my smart phone and the migraines went away I thought it was that particular model so when it came time for my free upgrade I then got another smart phone only to have the same issue It turns out that I am sensitive to what ever the method that data is sent and received in modern day smart phones I have a dumb phone with the mobile internet that does no effect me at all I still have the original smart phone that gave me the worst migraines and I use it to get on wifi and it does not effect me at all Hope this helps He is having an anxiety disorder and his symptoms are quiet severe so he definitely needs medication at least for 6months So consult a psychiatrist and take regular medications so that he could be free from his symptoms And also he can do relaxation therapy daily along with medications so that he can manage and see a difference in him Or he could even go for yoga for 1 or 2 months Gud luck Ive had DVT and it never presented in such a mannerhowever Im not a doctor so am not sure if that sort of pain could be DVT or not I doubt it seriously though  Ive never heard of DVT presenting like that IMO its more likely muscular If it persists see a doc I have a pain pump They have several meds besides morphine that can b usedIe Dilaudidsp I get just around 11mg per day of morphine without any side effects at all find new doctor I am not an expert but I have a history of pain during intercourse mine was a severe case of endometreosis this is caused by scar tissue building up on our internal organs during our monthly cycle I would definitely check with your OBGYN doctor and they should hopefully be able to find what is causing this What Ive just found is that Loridtine taking daily for allergies is causing bladder issues thats another name for Claritin Oddly I cracked four ribs and didnt know HOW I did it or even that I did it at all til next day Then it really hurt Mine was from doing something where pressure was put on it daily and then they just cracked Crazy i would see your doctor your lungs could have fluid in them i have low vitamin d so my doctor put me on 2 vitamin d3 2000 ius international units a day but

a year for the pain to go away enough for me to do normal activities Although 17 and a half years later I still limp and am unable to run I started having back pain a year ago they xrayed my back and

could not move the pain was so intense This went on for a day and then the next day I ended up not being able to get up at all I literally went face down into my carpet I could not let my husband touch me it hurt so bad The pain is in my lower left pelvic area and the pain wraps around into the left side my back Its now Nov1st and I am still hurting My reg doctor also tested me positive for blood in my urine and did nothing about it I do not have a UTI I am not pregnant my ovaries tested great I am 43 I have went through menopause I have had blood work done twice to confirm that I am 235 pounds I was diagnosed monday for fatty liver disease my colonoscopy results were great I laid down and touched my pelvic bone and followed the pain to my lower left side and the pain went to were my pelvic area reaches my thigh the crease it hurts really bad and if the doctor touches it I will probably faint Ok that was my life story for that past few months Someone please help Thank you in advance My mom just finished having shingles She was in so much pain she could not stand it She went on line looking for something that would take the pain and itching away She came across a product that was expensive but at that point she didnt care She purchased it and tried it She could not believe it when her pain was gone and the itching was no longer She still has one spot that itches everyday and I put some on that spot It says on the jar that everything is all natural It has been so worth the money to her She has bought extra jars for family and friends that have gotten this So far everyone of them said it took the pain away and stopped the itch Maybe it might help you It is called terrasil and she found it online I hope this might help you Vicki Chick I dont know how often or how much you eat but from someone who has had similar problems I would suggest cutting back on high fiber foods to like once a day with a meal and take a good probiotic with dinner each night Be sure the probiotic kills more than 1 strain Its over the counter This should relieve your symptoms I would suggest seeing your doctor and possible Xray Nerve damage in your neck Pulled muscles in your neck Either way if you are continually getting headaches you need to see your doctor I have this exact problem Good luck I have same thing white particles in my urinevery smallno pain I think its yeast or candida or minerals or infection After 2 months it is definitely better Very little back pain but some pain in the leg Will give it more time but no surgery at the present time i have the same problem at times only with pain half way down my arm i am told by ppl with simular problems that this could be a rotator cuff problem hope that helps it may have something to do with his spine it must somehow be grinding around his ribcage and causing it for its terrible pain if this has been going on for awhile you might want them to check her kiddneys you can get a a serious one and it will cause them sysptomand be very painful My husband went through a bad time in his life where he had to have alot of operations and when it was all done with he was addicted to pain pills but also had to have them for the pain he would have to deal with the rest of his life He started going to a out patient methadone clinic which really helped him stay off everything else and helped the pain There were pregnant women going there that also took the medication I really wouldnt recommend getting put on it if you can avoid it because these women had to deal with the nurses talking about them and calling them bad mothers cause the babies were addicted to the methadone and had to be hooked to ivs and given morphine until they could be taken off which was miserable for the babies So if you can just stop takin it that would be your best bet Most likely you bruised your tailbone Bruising of the tailbone can be quite painful It can take up to a few weeks to feel better If you pulled a muscle in your butt cheek then that could take just as long to heal A heating pad works good for a pulled muscle You could also alternate with an ice pack And before you know it you will feel better I am not an expert in this matter but it sounds like you may have diabetes Arthritis might play a role in it as well but I would definitely get a blood sugar test Severe depression anxiety possibly a mood disorder I would see a psychiatrist ASAP I have no problem my stomic I am very sorry that you that pain Im sorry that you have to feel sick just go and get any an Xray then u can only be clear what it is I had knee replacement in August 2012 and still have numbness from knee to ankle and stiffness and tightness extending around to calf Go to a doctor what are you waiting for dont stand up when the pain strikes at nightlay in bed for as long as you canlet it heel itself some ankle rotations instead of standing up With only your uterus removed I would get checked as far as maybe there being a cyst on your right ovary I give my dog one 325mg aspirin for her hip pain when it flares maybe try this No Tylenol or ibuprofen though it is toxic to animals Showing all the classic signs or symptoms of it I would say yes they should have but this is just in my own opinion By the way so sorry about your friend I wouldnt think that would cause it Sounds like osteoarthritis maybe Sounds to me like you have something causing pressure on a nerve that runs down the leg You need to go see a Rheumatologist They do a special test  A Touch Feel Test You have to have so many spots to have been diagnosed w fibromyalgia It took me 2 months to get in The doctors monitor your pain w medications especially fpr fibromyalgia I have just been to see one and I definitely was diagnosed positive for fibromyalgia Rheumatologist specialize in this Hope that this was helpful if you need more info let me know Tammy  Infrared photocoagulation works for about 7 to 10 out of 10 people who have it But improvements may not last And 2 out of 10 people may need surgery Also try using witch hazel on effected area after each BM It helps trust me Could be a cyst or boil or possible external hemorrhoid Keep area clean and eat plenty of fiber to ease BM If persist or worsens consult your family doctor Well that is a dangerous question to ask as you may not like the answers you will get although these issues may be caused by possible dehydration the drink more water part I think it was a brush off on the ERs part It is possible to be something far worse but I am not an MD in any way shape or form but to me it sounds a lot like MS I would have your family doctor look in to it and set up a appointment with a specialist  Bland Diet While no specific diet is recommended for those diagnosed with HenochSchnlein purpura you can lessen gastrointestinal symptoms by adhering to a bland diet A bland diet can be as simple as refraining from eating any spicy foods to a more strict BRAT diet The BRAT diet consists of bananas rice applesauce and toast This combination is generally welltolerated by those with an upset stomach Liquids It is important to remain hydrated when suffering from HenochSchnlein purpura The condition normally clears up on its own over a period of weeks but during that time it is important to take in sufficient water sports drinks herbal teas and broth to remain hydrated Avoid milk soft drinks and caffeinated beverages which can increase dehydration  Seated Exercises for neuropathy involving the feet ankles and legs Standing Exercises for Balance It is very important that you are safe when you work on balance exercises so you do not fall It may be necessary for you to have supervision or assistance from another person to prevent a fall If your balance is good enough you may stand by your kitchen sink or behind a sturdy chair Consult your doctor It could be and infection or possibly kidney stones either way only he can perscribe medication yes No  marijuana is not even legal in my state When I get a bad case of heart burn I can feel pain in my jaw It feels like its in my teeth as well Or maybe its indigestion  chest hurts stomach hurts wonder if its a hart attack Ends up being one of the above not heart attack  I have similar symptoms of knee pain as you show I also get mine from standing too long in lines or while Im at work I was diagnosed some years ago as having weak ligaments in both knees I spent 6 weeks in intense physical therapy that included mild electro shock therapy on the muscles and ligaments Once I was cleared from pt they gave me a series of exercises to do on a daily basis and it helped One of them was to find a door way that has a slight step up or use a block to stand on and with your knee that is hurting slowly lower your other foot down to the ground and come back up about 10x to start with You also should probably see a doctor to make sure there is no issue as far as a torn or inflamed acl tcl or mcl You may need a process of elimination Ask your primary care Dr for a referral for a gastroenterologist Have you had a colonoscopy  its NOT as scary as you think If you do get one you should bring someone with you they wont let you drive yourself home If or when they find nothing then go from there I had something similar thats who I went to Calm down a good patient is an educated patient FWIW deduced an iron or protein deficiency led to two bouts of calf cramping causing a severe strain in a ligament or tendon in each of the calves I believe the condition was heightened by strenuous cycling for a three month period before the injury that created a need for more nutrients which I didnt intake and led to the deficiency This was the initial injury I saturated my diet with protein vitamins and an iron supplement which corrected the deficiency But the strenuous activity followed by complete inactivity led to atrophy of the calf muscles It was pretty serious I could pinch a lot of flesh on my calf A slow increase in exercise has corrected the pain and weakness Maybe this report will help someone down the line talk to your doctor and tell her everything about this past problem and what your other doctor gave you that worked and i really think you should find out what is causing this paingood luck and God bless you A hysterectomy to cure pain is a bad idea Hysterectomies cannot be reversed and the side effects can be severe Not all HRTs are good for you There are other procedures that can be performed for certain pains Definitely get 2nd and 3rd opinions before taking such a radical step I had a hysterectomy 12 years ago without getting a 2nd opinion wish I had its ok its normal i work standing up for 10 hours a day n the same thing happens to me usauley a warm batch and some epsom salt that can help for the past couple of weeks i have experienced the same symptoms but its becuse i am preagnant im in my first trimester mabye you are you shuld mabye just check just to make shure possibly a pinched nerve I had back pain after getting an epidural for a couple months after a couple of my kids I also had some migrains deffinately a heating pad It helps me It will make it better softer beds are bad for your posture and dont support your spine correctly when you sleep resulting in back pain a good firm mattress though uncomfortable is best for people who suffer from back pain Have you had your thyroid checked I was having pain and stiffness right posterior neck and subscapular muscle spasms After taking 25mcgm of synthroid the pain stiffness and spasms went away Also wanted to post a link to a photo WARNING  its the base of a penis  httpimgurcomNtF5fGq It could be the mattress itself the positioning of your body whilst sleeping or the material the pillows are made from I would say to invest in another mattress or try sleeping somewhere else to see what happens Your neck is greatly affected by the positioning of your body Stomach pain as in the actual organ Your stomach is on the upper left side You might have damaged your bursa sac It could be IBS because it is know to cause a wide range of symptoms flatulence belching pain diarrhea constipation mucus in stool etc A person with IBS can have symptoms that change and bouts where they have lots of digestive troubles then it fixes itself After a few months another bout fixes itself etc I dont believe that massage will end her nerve pain but it can help relax her a bit A massage works better to help muscle pain A medication can be prescribed to help with the nerve pain by making the nerve endings less sensitive Cymbalta is one of the medications that works well If your sister does not have open sores then she cant pass it to the therapist Stretches core strengthening exercises visit a chiropractor get a massage If you get a massage try to do something with hot stones I would go to another doctor as soon as you can tell them to check for gallstones If your having new problems breathing go to an emergency room near you or call 911 The other information is not useful to further diagnose you without an examination andor tests If you have had a past medical history of blood clots or recent surgery you should call 911 imediately Advil See your Dr immediately Did they test you for carpel tunnel You might have that or you might just have tender wrist See if you can get tested for Carpel Tunnel I had the same thing and was told that we have a floating rib I went to therapy they gave me hot packs and sat at the end of a table and reached for a beach ball I left physical therapy and did the same thing at home Recently I had the same thing and had a chest xray and cscan and I have a node on my lung but it still feels just like you described My problem still exists numbness in small finfer and two next to it pain in back of shoulder The frequency of need to urinate can be contributed to onset of anxiety and also is a diabetes symptom Strongly recommend you share this with your doctor on next visit Also potentially infection if female Unlikely if male I have had surgery on both knees from skiing through the years Want to guess what the symptoms were Go see the Dr It isnt just a bruise Knees are a lot more delicate than we give them credit for Pain med addiction requires the liver and kidneys to work very hard to clear the body of toxins Over time you will want more and moreskip the legal potentials You may have memory issues increase dosage requirements constipation blood in urine kidney pain loss of sexual abilities poor cognitive skills Best of all in time you wont get high any more but will still crave them You name anything bad that can happen to the body and the uncontrolled use pain meds can cause it See about getting some help to either get off or get to the dose you should be at It is highly unlikely you will be able to get off cold turkey Anxiety is very physical and dont let others do the helpful things like saying Just quit Just dont let it get to you etc It is your body reaction to the environment and your systems react quickly and badly While others are letting bad things pass off them like water off a duck you are absorbing every dang thingthe emotions the sounds the fears the visionsall of it You go on overload Non medical solution is to always move from the location dont return to it till ALL the anxiety is over avoid places and people that you know will trigger it ignore people that have lots of advice for you that includes discounting what you are experiencing Avoid caffeine or anything else that will increase your heart rate Try meditation in a quiet dimly lit silent place or just soft wordless music It can be controlled but ONLY if you can find a way to feel your environment isnt a mess of loose strings and unguided paths You MUST feel you have control of your lifeso take it Best of luck Yes could also kill you or your passenger i have
