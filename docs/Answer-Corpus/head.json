{"text": "It sounds like it could be a mild form of staff I had something similar and my doctor gave me pills But another doctor told me to take a bath in plain water and a cap of bleach and after about a week it went away sounds like u have the flu or cold and sinus an infection both  There are many reasons for hair loss Poor Nutritional diet No sleep Stress Go go a dermatologist and have the areas frozen It will remove them completely Have you gone to your Doctor or a Neurologist I suggest you get an MRI to see what can be going on in there There could be many things Have you had any trauma in the past Have you ever hurt your head Tooth infection If you have missed your period then you should take a home pregnancy test Make sure to follow all of the directions on the box or you could get false results This usually happens after first waking up or after periods of inactivity when the blood pressure is low Whats happening is your rapid standing is lowering the blood pressure in your head Fainting is a natural response and is technically possible if you stand extremely fast after one of these inactive periods If it happens often or after periods where you are not inactive mention it to a doctor and have your blood pressure checked In the meantime just dont spring to your feet really fast It happens to me too To my knowledge there is no relationship between head size and breast vs bottle feeding More importantly as long as your childs head circumference is well within the normal range and following the nearest growth curve then there is little to worry about Hey this is the original poster Thank you everyone for your answers The problem still persists but I am waiting for health insurance to kick in before I go to a doctor and check it out Although its not as bad as it used to be Thank you for your answer Dr Moser I have been trying to find a trustworthy and reliable place for me to submit a picture of my symptom and somebody recommended me to webmd Would it be possible for me to submit an image of my condition to you privately Perhaps it would better assist in understanding what may be causing this dryness Pregnancy can be a scary time and all women worry about whether something they did might harm their baby The best advice is to never take any medication both over the counter and prescription during pregnancy without first discussing this with your doctor The first trimester is a time where the baby is developing and miscarriages happen A few studies have suggested that medicines like ibuprofen which is a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug NSAID can increase the risk of a miscarriage in the first trimester But other studies have failed to find a connection A recent study done at Vanderbilt though has good news This study looked at overthecounter NSAID use in pregnant women during the first six weeks of pregnancy and found that there was not an increased risk of miscarriage There are also concerns that NSAIDs can cause heart problems in the baby in the third trimester In general women should avoid medication use during pregnancy if possible and always talk to their doctor first Most experts think that acetaminophen Tylenol rather than an NSAID is a safer option for occasional pain relief during pregnancy I have someone in my family who has had a traumatic brain injury He has been on numerous prescriptions since August 2012 given to him by his neurologist Let me also add he was hit by a 90 lb crankshaft that fell from 9 feet in the air off of a pallet The crankshaft landed midway on the leftside of the back of his head neck and back The doctor started him on hydrocodone and this only made matters worse headache wise He was then put on oxycodone which has been a lifesaver Oxycodone helps when nothing else does God bless you and I hope you get to feeling better No head lice does not leave bumps or bruising but depending on how often they bite you an area it can become sore If you are worried about lice there is a place in Tigard and Beaverton I believe called Lice Knowing You that check and treat for lice If it is something you cannot afford at least do buy lice comb from there because their combs are 99 more effective than drug store combs You can still buy one from the drug store and if you do not have olive oil or coconut oil buy some and some plastic shower caps After that go home and apply alive oil to everyones hair make sure you get it everywhere then put the caps on and either sleep with the olive oil on and wash it off Im the morning or just put the blow dryer over your head for thirty minutes Before you wash out the olive oil though get everyones laundry in the laundry room put stuffed animals in large garbage bags for three weeks or just toss them in the dryer for thirty minutes on high and vacuum everything Also most store bought products do not actually work And the bumps and bruises could be an allergic reaction to all the chemicals I cannot use the store bought products because I get sick and cannot do anything for a few days The chemicals are really harmful not only to your hair and scalp but your whole body I dont have an answer I have the same problem and am looking for an answer NO httpwwwlivestrongcomarticle227799symptomsofsmallvesselbraindisease Go to this website and it will give you more information and will give you other sites for more information but not it isnt neuropathy of the brain so to speak but other factors such as build up of plaque in the veins that is the issue and when the plaque builds up it narrows the arteries Check this website out though for more information The best of luck to you and GOD BLESS It very well could be a number of things such as nerve damage in your neck migraine or even vertigo Best thing to do is to talk to your doctor right away and see what could initially be causing this pain  You may be experiencing a phenomenon known a Tactile Hallucinations It is only a guess The name for this disorder is derived from the following two words 1 Tactile is the term used to describe the sense of touch 2 Hallucinations are false sensory perceptions that occur without any supporting environmental stimuli Sensory hallucinations can also involve other senses body senses such as taste and sight and have causes similar to those associated with Tactile Hallucinations Refer to the below links for other WebMd questions that I have answered httpanswerswebmdcomanswers5051457itastesoapwheneverieatordrinkevenwateridonottakemedicationsorsupplements httpanswerswebmdcomanswers5051154whydoismellsmokeandthereisnosmoke Yes Tactile Hallucinations are observed in individuals with emotional conditions such schizophrenia But some serious medical conditions can also be responsible These medical causes may include tumor growths infectious disorders alcohol or drug ingestion epilepsy and others Since I am not a physician I can only speculate on a reasonable cause for your false sensory perceptions Without knowing your age length of time that you have experienced these tactile sensations medications taken and overall medical history it is difficult to make any absolute judgments about your symptom I recommend that you start off in your quest for definitive answers by visiting your family doctor That individual may provide you with a physical exam and order some preliminary diagnostic testing They may also prescribe treatment options and refer you to other medical specialist  Syncope with collapsing is both a disturbing medical condition and one that may literally occur for a 100 different reasons As you may know syncope may be due to multiple cardiac conditions neurological conditions tumors hematology disorders such as anemia low blood pressure emotional disturbances and may result from a host of other organ and system origins The best diagnosing tool available may be a competent and caring doctor who will conduct a thorough physical exam and interrogation interview with the patient Asking questions such as frequency of the syncope asking for you to explain in your own words what you are experiencing while you are losing consciousness any prewarning signals from the body that you are about to collapse when did the syncope first happen do you have other family members who also experience syncope and many other seemingly innocent questions that may give your detective doctor a clue to the cause of your condition Diagnostic testing that is most useful includes blood serum studies and brain scans such as PET Scans CAT Scans and MRI Scans EEG testing is not always reliable in detecting syncope and may be less helpful Now I am going to send you in another direction I do not possess any clinical expertise in the field of collapsing but must throw an idea into the diagnosing ring Has the thought of a seizure disorder been considered and ruled out as a cause for your symptoms In actually a seizure disorder technically doesnt fit into the definition of syncope But my eyes actually bulgedout a bit when I read your statement of becoming incontinent of urine during some of your collapsing events I have witnessed at least 100 seizures episodes of varying degrees of severity Some patients experience full blown seizures with a loss of consciousness and uncontrollable body jerking Grand Mal Seizure Other individuals may only notice a momentary loss of consciousness and have no noticeable jerking activity Petit Mal Seizure People observing an individual while having a petite mal seizure may even think that the victim is blankingout a bit and just not paying attention Both of these seizure types sometimes have urinary incontinency as a routine symptom occurring either before or during the seizure The brain scans are the most useful tools in diagnosing seizure disorders It may take some extra time to conclusively rulein and ruleout different reasons for your symptoms but with the million dollar battery of testing being conducted a correct diagnosis and treatment plan should be in the near future  In order to come up with some reliable numbers assumptions needed to be made as follows Sex Male age 30 height 58 exercise level moderate A 12 ounce can of Pepsi contains 150 calories Drinking 8 cans per day adds an additional 1200 calories If you could eliminate 7 of cans per day you would save 1000 daily calories from being added to your diet That 1000 daily calorie reduction would result in approximately a 2 pound per week weight reduction  That means in approximately 3 months the total weight loss would be about 24 pounds just by cutting back on the soda to one per day Thats not too bad Weaning yourself off the soda slowly perhaps by eliminating 1 can every 3 days may help with possible withdrawal headaches  I would discuss your symptoms with your parents and immediately contact the prescriber of your Wellbutrin medication order Wellbutrin can cause side effects such as being dizzy feeling light headed being uncoordinated high blood pressures which can explain your headaches head pain confusion and many more Please open the WebMd link below

Perhaps you can borrow the money from family or friends to see a primary care doctor and have some basic blood studies done It seems that the breathing of welding fumes can be hazardous and related to your medical symptoms A company called Plymovent talks about breathing in of welding fumes as follows The content of the welding rods coatings filler metals and base materials also greatly impacts your health The biggest potential threat is exposure to the manganese contained in fumes that are given off during welding Inhaling manganese can cause very serious damage to your brain and nervous system  Many individuals who are exposed to welding fumes suffer from Parkinsons disease a major disorder affecting movement and balance They often develop manganism a disease closely related to Parkinsons that also makes it difficult to walk and move properly Both manganism and Parkinsons disease cause tremors shaking and loss of muscle control These conditions can become more severe as time passes When the welding rod or base metal is iron or mild steel iron oxide may be contained in the welding fumes in addition to manganese Breathing in iron oxide irritates your nasal passages throat and lungs  Working with stainless steel may produce welding fumes containing nickel and chromium If you have asthma exposure to nickel can make your illness worse Chromium can aggravate or cause sinus problems  Both nickel and chromium may cause cancer according to NIOSH Safety and Health Fact Sheet No 4 American Welding Society Welding Fumes and Gases Center to Protect Workers Rights Welding on some plated or painted metals may be especially hazardous Welding Fumes Sampling Mine Safety and Health Administration Cadmium is often used as a coating on steel to prevent rust However cadmium in welding fumes causes the lung disease emphysema as well as kidney failure Cadmium Exposure from Welding American Welding Society Welding Health Hazards OSHA If you cut a metal that has been coated with paint that contains lead it may give off welding fumes containing lead oxide Inhaling these welding fumes can cause lead poisoning a condition in which you become weak and develop anemia a low red blood cell count Lead also harms your nervous system kidneys and reproductive system Lead ATSDR Some welding rods are coated with asbestos If you inhale asbestos dust that is released into the air you are at risk for developing serious asbestosrelated diseases These include lung cancer an aggressive cancer called mesothelioma and asbestosis which is a scarring of the lungs I dont want all of these many medical conditions to cause you great worry or to become obsessed with thoughts of doom I just wanted to honestly tell you what honest research has to say about breathing in welding fumes Of course your danger from incurring any of the above referenced medical conditions is probably directly related to the amount of time spent welding and the quantity of exposure material  The diagnosis process used by many doctors is called Differential Diagnosis Essentially a list of the top possible conditions is developed based upon case symptoms and testing results Onebyone these conditions are reduced to just one by the process of elimination I even approach most multiple choice test questions in this fashion I look for all of the incorrect answers until all that is left is the correct answer Based upon the basic information provided in your question I believe that the best choice for your fathers problems is related to his seizure disorder I have personally witnessed at least 100 seizures of varying types intensity and being had by different individuals The two details that you mentioned and swaying my determination to a seizure disorder were your dads obvious seizure history and the 15 minute time frame duration of the weakness dizziness and slurred speech Ministrokes TIAs for example usually last for only seconds to a few minutes seizures better fit the 15 minute duration of for the presenting symptoms The type of seizure that you have described in your question is called Petite Mal These types of seizures usually do not produce any obvious convulsive activity At first blush you may even think that the individual is just zoningout and not paying attention Now that a reasonable differential diagnosis has been developed lets answer your second question regarding whether or not medications are causing the seizures In and by them the answer is probably No Yes medication side effects and interactions can cause your dads symptoms But what is more likely is that the current medications are not adequately controlling the seizures Perhaps his previous medication regime of a year ago was the correct recipe My immediate thought would be to gradually restore the medication activity as it was prescribed a year ago It is a matter of trial and error until optimum dosage titration is achieved In summary 1 I am not a doctor and my answer represents just my best ideas and opinions based upon the data supplied with your question and my health care experience I do not know your fathers complete medical history have not seen testing results or medications being taken and cannot ask questions My answer cannot compare favorably to a hospital and their specialists million dollar types of diagnostic testing conducted and the conclusions of a neurologist With that disclaimer being presented my suggestive thoughts make some sense 2 I would respectfully recommend that you speak to the neurologist about the pros and cons of changing the medications back to what they were a year ago Best wishes for health improvement with your father  Whether the ER doctor prescribes medication for panic attacks varies according to their medical training their comfort level in treating anxiety type psychiatric disorders and their overall individual philosophy One study determined that 17 of patients reporting to a hospital emergency room were experiencing a panic attack Many time chest pains thought to be a heart attack signal upon ER arrival end up being a panic attack The doctor must assess the patient correctly diagnosis panic attack and make a determination if medication should be given to treat the condition When medication is determined to be the treatment option some choices may include IM injections andor pills including antianxiety drugs like alprazolam Several antidepressants such as paroxetine may also be considered Also available is a newer selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor group of medications such as Citalopram Brand name Celexa Fluoxetine Brand names Prozac Rapiflux Sarafem Selfemra Fluvoxamine maleate Brand name Luvox Paroxetine  Paroxetine mesylate Brand names Paxil Pexeva Sertraline Brand name Zoloft Also available are the older tricyclic drugs and monoamine oxidase inhibitors for treating panic disorder such as Amitriptyline Elavil Protriptyline Vivactil Desipramine Norpramin Nortriptyline Aventyl or Pamelor Trimipramine Surmontil Perphenazine Triavil Even though so many medications are available to treat panic attacks in the ER and many more come are in the works for being approved patients many times are not given any medication to treat the panic symptoms Your pet should be seen quickly by a veterinarian  It is a sure bet that the dog didnt always drag his tail shake his head move slowly and reject fluids water as you state in your question Something is very wrong and needs the emergency intervention of an expert The situation has gone past the point of just being able to persuade the dog into taking in more fluids The rejection of water is a symptom rooted in a more serious problem The vet has the medical training to properly diagnosis illness the equipment necessary to conduct a proper exam and the ability to appropriately treat the animal Without seeing the vet shortly to receive IV fluids your dogs vital organs and systems will shut down resulting in its death Dying due to chronic dehydration is said to be very painful If money is an issue then see if the vet will bill you in installments If you cannot take the dog to the vet and work out the monetary expense issue then please consider taking the dog to a local animal shelter for their help in determining a humane resolution  Youve already taken the 1st step in overcoming your negative response to anger Youre admitting the problem Hopefully that acknowledgement of a problem will propel you forward Perhaps some of my thoughts as follows will assist your efforts Identify the cause of your displeasure  Keep a journal and annotate what triggered your anger and the resultant selfabuse behavior Were you feeling frustrated disappointed powerless in efforts to have what you wanted resentful or angry at others etc List the feelings that you had before and after the angry outburst occurred For example you may feel afraid of yourself may have felt embarrassed or felt like you might be arrested placed in a hospital for your own protection or feel like you wanted to harm someone else Many episodes of selfdestructive behaviors are a result of some type of irrational fear For example some individuals may feel like they are No Good nobody cares about me anyway or that things will never change It is helpful to identify those fears and confirm to yourself that they are irrational Review the causes and irrational fears as outlined in your journal Set up positive alternatives to your selfdestructive behavior For example scream in a private place cry talk to others listen to music and most of all promote selfesteem by reaffirming to yourself that you are a valuable person This problem will not just disappear Ask friends family church clergy school officials or your physician for help and guidance with a confidential problem Join an anger management support group Many times these groups are run in an anonymous fashion Sometimes just listening to others who have had your same feelings and having a forum for you to express your feelings can lead to improvement of your condition If things become too overwhelming and you feel like hurting yourself or others it is time to seek professional treatment through counseling and medications Best wishes for a productive journey in feeling good about yourself and in experiencing a joyful life  Youve already taken

others it is time to seek professional treatment through counseling and medications Best wishes for a productive journey in liking yourself and in experiencing a joyful life The first thing to understand is that Its not just in your head Youre not hallucinating you are not delusion and you are not experiencing illusions You feel what you feel Secondly a person can have physical conditions and be experiencing an emotional decline at the same timeYesthere is a close relationship between the mind and the body But the bottom line is not to just dismiss your physical symptoms as being attributable to psychological reasons Nobody by just reading your question could properly diagnosis your case With that said I will attempt to provide you with some nonprofessional advise based upon my experience in the medical counseling and mental health fields as follows If you feel like you may want hurt yourself  please go to the hospital now for immediate help  Make an appointment to see your family doctor or go to some form of walkin clinic to be medically assessed During this visit your heart breathing nervous stomach and fatigue can be assessed Blood work can be done to rule out such conditions as thyroid disease and medication interactionssideeffects vital signs will be taken and possibly a chest xray and a cardiogram may be completed If necessary referrals to other professional can be started Once youve confirmed that your physical state is satisfactory it is time to have your emotional health evaluated There are mental health agencies check online for local government mental health agencies that will conduct a screening of your uncomfortable feelings I see that youve taken medication offandon for a psychiatric condition Perhaps your medication regime needs to be updated and some talk therapy started You should not have to remain feeling uncomfortable with your reported physical and emotional symptoms Even though Im not a physician I can promise you one thing Your symptoms will not just disappear on their own Like most conditions the faster that a diagnosis is made and treatment started the shorter the period of feeling bad and the better the chance for recovery I hope that my answer has been helpful and that you seek help quickly Best wishes for your success You may have developed heat exhaustion Being outside in 90 degree heat for three hours can cause heat exhaustion symptoms such as headaches fatigue disorientation and lightheadedness Engaging in any work related activity under 90 degree temperatures can exacerbate the severity of your headaches The ear ringing and tingling teeth are not typical symptoms associated with heat exhaustion but may be additional signs of body temperature and balance irregularities unique to your body Perspiration happens in response to the body attempting to cool down In order for perspiration to achieve its intended mission adequate body fluids must be available and the air flow must be conducive to absorption into the skin In your question you state in part I have been walking a long time and was sweating a lot until the last 10 minutes of the trip Based on that statement I believe you stopped perspiring perhaps due to dehydration and your body became overheated menopause I meant to put tourettes not torrents Sorry Thats normal i guessmy small baby brother had several lumps on his head the doc said its because of his growth hormonesthyroid glands you may visit a doc to be certain YOU need to see your doctor immediately You need an MRI or CT of the spine You could have a herinated disk and or numerous other things when you are talking about anything to do with the spine And with the other symptoms you are having if they have NOT resolved by now RUN to the ER or at least see your own doctor asap this is nothing to play around with I KNOW for fact Broke my neck at level C3 and 5 just lifting a patient You could have injuries that could paralize you Hope this helps at least to make you aware that anything to do with the spine is life changing Angel I only once had some mild peeling or flaking and it turned out that my wife had a yeast infection The flaking was on the shaft not the glans and went away I dont think the water would be a factor between the US and Canada The glans of my penis also circumcised stopped looking smooth after I started having sex I wouldnt say the skin looked cracked and dry so much as wrinkled and faded So I tried putting baby oil Vaseline or whatever lotion was around on after a shower but nothing ever reversed the wrinkling Ive always wondered if that would have happened if I hadnt been circumcised I would try to see a neurologist and at least get a CATscanonce youve seen your doctor I have no experience with those symptoms but my sister complains of this when she get her migrane headaches I would seek the advise of a medical technician and get an MRI This could be related to anxiety which causes different things for different people Since your symptoms seem to improve when youre not at work and youve only recently started having them after stopping the birth control and the cervical cancer tests I would suspect that anxiety could be the cause It could also ironically be a sideeffect from stopping or starting the birth control which can have physical side effects You can always visit a doctor if you are really worried or if the symptoms get worse but I dont think you have too much to worry about I would strongly suggest that you take him to a doctor since he has had lingering problems after the falls If he has not gotten better after so long it is unlikely to improve by just waiting NO lol no not true at all Can start going bald at any age just like you can go grey at any age My daughter has cat scratch fever wheb she was little it would start with a sore throat and the throat would get infected a huge knot of puss went from one side of her kneck to the other Finally had to take her to the hospital and an dr numb her kneck where the infection was at and lanced it to get the puss out the puss was the infection going from one side to the other so yes you need to see a dr soon as possible Hi there Kico Have you seen a pulminologist It sounds like coughvariant asthma My son has this form of asthma the asthma meds help control the coughing I forgot to mention my sons xrays are always clear and he rarely ever wheezes But he does have asthma I have seen improvements from being on different inhalers Although we are still trying to figure out how severe his case is since even prednisone doesnt fix the cough now Not really it might be alarming but I think it is normal I had a same sort of incident I fell off a swing and I could remember a couple of memos from way back in my childhood So it could be bad and it could be good I think its great that you can remember all of that and Im sorry that incident happened to you I can understand this feeling Once in awhile I get those annoying headaches that come then go In your case I would expect it Sometimes people may get headachesaftermaths of a incident I got them for a couple of days then it was gone I dont know much about aspirin but I guess if it helps then stay strong and go on If you feel that you dont get the answer on this then go see your doc They are there to help you Hope this helped  Also I havent slept a whole lot lately I dont know for sure but I believe our bodies fight to restore itself I was once told to give it 2 weeks or more depending on the severity Dont over exert yourself let your body heal If it is baby acne this is a normal rash that should go away on its own  usually related to hormones from the pregnancy Typically we would expect it to be resolving at four months so I wonder if there are other ideas to consider Seborrhea is a common cause of bumpy facial rash that can occur on the scalp and eyebrows as yellow crusty scaly dandruff and look like red greasy bumps on the cheeks behind the ears neck and chest This too is very common but there are methods to help it clear faster  Closed head injuries are a major issue in sports particularly with children Concussion is what we call a closed head injury and managing patients both in the initial post injury period and the ensuing days to weeks can be challenging  As for post concussive symptoms headache concentration problems dizziness sleepiness and a whole bunch more are all symptoms that can be present For how long is very individual People need to be symptom free at rest before the begin resuming ANY exercise program or sporting activity This is even more important in kids as they are still developing their brains There are more and more docs now who specialize in both concussion management and helping getting people back to normal activity If your son is still symptomatic I would get him seen by a local sports medicine doc who is knowledgeable in concussion I used to play football and suffered from this as well I personally put a little bit of Vaseline on my chin and forehead before putting on my helmet It helped Also if that doesnt work try putting a fungicide on your chin guard and the inside of your helmet It could be a form of jock itch You get sweaty in those helmets and they can be a breeding ground for all sorts of things Hope this helps I would consult your doctor asap They may want to do a scope to look inside your throat for possible tumors What kind of pain is it Is it located in your throat itself or in the neck in general It sounds like you may have hurt your rotator cuff I popped mine lifting bags that were too heavy for me I couldnt lift my bent elbow above my shoulder or straighten out my arm above my head It hurt down the back of my arm in the triceps area to the elbow and biceps Unable to move my arm backward Had to see the doctor By the way it doesnt go away just stays the same or gets worse I know this because I waited over a year thinking the pain would subside This is a very common problem in women and when you have a diagnosis its a relief in some ways because now we can direct treatment for it So what I like the most for polycystic ovary syndrome is all contraceptives and sometimes combined with a diuretic called Aldactone and the generic name is Spironolactone I find that these two together not only help balance out the hormones but also help regrow the hair Oftentimes in polycystic ovary syndrome we see a triad of changes We see irregular periods along with often severe acne and hair loss on the scalp and there is also another component which may be increased hair growth on the upper lip or chin as well Sometimes people have regular periods and so the diagnosis is missed because the endocrinologist or OB thinks that it cant be polycystic ovary syndrome because it cant measure the hormone imbalance But when you have those other effects of hair loss on the scalp acne hair growth on the face and sometimes with or without weight change going on oral contraceptives can help and adding Aldactone or Spironolactone can help as well Its very important to treat it because women who have this syndrome are at increased risk of diabetes and also heart disease later in life So its not just an esthetic or how you look that matters its your overall health that can be affected so you should definitely have it treated It could be psoriasis or a condition called seborrheic dermatitis Both are chronic conditions but have different underlying causes and somewhat different treatments You can start by using a salicylic acidbased wash and OTC hydrocortisone and a salicylic acid or tarbased shampoo If it does not improve your dermatologist will be able to evaluate and offer prescription treatments to better control the condition The symptoms you described happen often in people that work out without drinking enough water Even if you think youre drinking plenty try drinking more and see what happens Good for you for making the sensible decision not to rely on cigarettes for stress control Its much better to learn good coping techniques than to selfmedicate The good news is you probably did not irreversibly harm your lungs by smoking lightly for a month Even heavier smokers can undo the damage to their lungs to a certain extent by quitting If youre young and you maintain a smokefree lifestyle you should do just fine I hope this sets your mind at ease Im thinking you had a removed from your scalp Depending on the size of the cyst you shouldnt have any residual effects You might experience a bit of swelling and you can feel free to put cold packs on the surgical site be sure to place a towel or some other barrier betwen the ice and your skin For ice 20 minutes on then 20 minutes off is the standard protocol If the incision was closed with staples or sutures stitches and youre not allergic to antibiotics you can put antibiotic ointment triple antibiotic ointment Bacitracin Neosporin on the incision You should always make sure to wash your hands before applying the ointment to your incision If your incision was closed with adhesive glue Dermabond you do not need to put antibiotic ointment on it and actually should avoid doing so You probably dont need to cover the wound You may experienced localized numbness at the surgical site This probably will clear up over the course of several weeks All of these instructions assume you had a cyst removed from your scalp Please consult your surgeons office for specific postop instructions Hope this helps So sorry to hear youre going through this I can think of few things worse than a sinus headache Your best bet is to make another trip to the doctor for a reevaluation of your symptoms It sounds like youre doing everything right in terms of taking your prescribed medications checking your shower for mold and mildew etc Since your symptoms have continued after finishing the antibiotics you were prescribed youd be welladvised to go back for further evaluation Your health care provider may want to try a different type of medication to help manage your symptoms In the meantime you can try taking overthecounter pain relievers as directed on the bottle This may help some with the pain Good luck to you Feel better soon Sorry youre going through this Some people are prone to developing  and its not a pleasant process to go through If you are not running a fever you can probably take a waitandsee attitude toward the situation A fever is indicative of an infection though a localized skin infection may not cause much of a fever Drainage is good when it comes to cysts so you can try applying very warm compresses to the area to help draw out the remaining fluid The white head youre seeing could be a layer of skin cells regrowing to cover the opening Although you can gently scrub the skin to keep the cyst open we generally discourage people from doing this because you dont want to inadvertently introduce infection to the area Speaking of which you also can apply antibacterial ointment to the area to reduce the chances of the wound becoming infected Its not unusual for a large sebaceous cyst to take several days to completely drain after it has burst on its own Assuming youre not allergic to any overthecounter pain remedies you can take ibuprofen or acetaminophen for the pain If you continue to have concerns about the cyst or if it emits a smelly greenish pus or if you start running a fever then its time for a trip to the doctor Its not necessarily an emergency but Id recommend you call your primary health care provider if the situation gets worse or doesnt clear up over the next several days Wishing you well Im sorry to hear youre experiencing this If by feels like it will explode you mean you feel increased pressure in your head whenever you bend or cough this is a cause for concern As you know Plavix generic name  is a blood thinner Obviously when taking a blood thinner you dont want to break a blood vessel  especially one in your head Id advise you to see your doctor as soon as possible about this He or she will be able to determine if you should continue using the clopidogrel Plavix or whether a different medication or none at all may be more appropriate for you In the meantime exercise caution when bending lifting or coughing If you need to use throat lozenges for example to calm a dry throat please do so I wish you all the best It means you should go see your primary care doctor to find out whats going on here Since youve been off the amitriptyline for three weeks the medication should be totally out of your system That means your symptoms must be due to something else You need a physical examination and possibly some lab work to figure this out Its not surprising the vaginal pain returned after you stopped the amitriptyline since vulvodynia is a chronic condition Hopefully youll find something else that works to treat it without side effects Wishing you well Im sorry to hear youre going through this I hope you seek treatment for your depression and other symptoms Perhaps youll find comfort in knowing there is a name for the condition you describe The compulsive urge to pull your hair out is called   This condition frequently goes handinhand with depression or anxiety I hope you will be happy to learn this condition is treatable I urge you to find a mental health provider who can help treat your depression and your hairpulling Its frequently necessary to see several mental health professionals before you find the right one the person you click with the one who understands you and the one who is the right fit for you So dont give up if the first person you see doesnt seem to be helpful Keep trying Most health insurance plans now cover behavioral health treatment at the same level as medical health treatment If you are unable to afford treatment please contact your local branch of the National Alliance on Mental Illness NAMI or a crisis hotline Even though you may not be in crisis the hotline can provide you with resources to help you I wish you all the best Have you had your blood sugar tested lately You describe some of the classic symptoms of  This condition can occur when you eat a quantity of simple sugars and the body responds by producing an excessive amount of insulin This overreaction by the body leaves too little glucose sugar available to your cells for processing Symptoms of hypoglycemia can include Nauseavomiting Sweating Dizzinesslightheadedness Fainting Shakiness Heart palpitations Blurred or double vision I suggest you see your primary care doctor to tell him or her about these symptoms Your provider may want you to take a fasting blood glucose test to make sure you dont have diabetes Meanwhile if you experience symptoms before you can see a doctor you can try eating a small quantity of candy or sugar to see if the symptoms resolve It sounds odd but if your blood sugar is low you actually want to add some sugar to your body  not a lot though Too much sugar can cause a hypoglycemic reaction all over again Wishing you well Im sorry you experience this It doesnt sound pleasant thats for sure Whenever a patient describes pain with words like jolt of electricity we tend to think in terms of nerve pain Only a physical examination and perhaps some testing like Xrays or MRI can say for sure whats going on with your neck That said I would suspect you occasionally pinch a nerve when you turn your head suddenly This type of can occur if you have a spinal disc that is slowly collapsing or if you have some arthritis in the vertebrae spinal bones of your neck While I dont think this situation is an emergency I would suggest you get this checked out by a health care provider soon Catching spine problems early usually results in a better outcome You can start with a visit to your primary care provider and he or she can get the ball rolling Hope this helps Im sorry to hear about your accident Ouch I certainly would suggest you get this checked out It sounds like you might have a  Concussions can vary from mild to severe If youre having pain around one eye my concern would be that you damaged some of the delicate structures around your eye socket That definitely deserves to be checked by a medical professional as well as getting an assessment of your head injury in general Because this happened over a week ago I dont necessarily think you need to go to an emergency room Id suggest phoning your primary care provider and explaining the situation so they work you in as soon as possible If they cant get you in within a day or two then I guess Id suggest you head for an urgent care I mean on the one hand this doesnt sound like an emergency anymore but on the other hand it probably needs to get checked out sooner rather than later Just for future reference if you ever hit your head hard enough to black out even for a moment or if you experience dizziness fuzzy memory nausea or any of the other  you should go to the emergency room I wish you all the best and hope you feel better soon The sequence of events here is a little unclear to me It sounds like you had your gallbladder removed recently and also have other symptoms that sound unrelated to your gallbladder problem If you had your gallbladder removed recently and you have three or four small incisions including one in your belly button then you had  During this procedure several small incisions are made in your abdomen and instruments are inserted through them To make this process work your abdomen is inflated with harmless carbon dioxide gas The unfortunate side effect of this gas is postsurgery bloating and sometimes pain At times the pain can occur in the shoulder area This is normal and should go away within several days Vomiting after gallbladder surgery also is not uncommon If you follow a lowerfat diet it should help with the vomiting issue If you had gallbladder surgery recently you should be scheduled for followup appointments with your surgeon Please keep these appointments Your surgeon will be able to tell you if your recovery is progressing normally The pimples and sores in your underarm thigh and nipple area do not sound like theyre related to your gallbladder issues Digestive system issues usually do not manifest as skin problems I would suggest you consult a dermatologist or even your primary care physician to take a look at these lesions to find out what they are and whats causing them I hope this helps and wish you all the best Im sorry to hear youre experiencing this Chronic sinus problems are not uncommon and unfortunately there isnt always a good solution to fixing them In answer to your question No ear wax and sinus problems are not related also called cerumen is a combination of skin cells skin oils dust and other debris that can build up in the ear canal the outer portion of the ear People obsess about ear wax sometimes but unless your health care provider tells you to do something about the wax you can simply clean the ear canal with a damp washcloth Dont go poking cotton swabs in there The swooshing sound youre describing when you stand up quickly may or may not be related to your sinuses or your  Many people experience a phenomenon called   which is fancy talk for a sudden drop in blood pressure when standing You could possibly hear this when it occurs Or you could have fluid in your Eustachian tubes Only a health care provider can tell for sure Id suggest you continue to see your family doctor about the problem and discuss whether or not she would refer you to a different ENT doctor There may be new treatments available since you last investigated this problem Hope this helps This is a hard question to answer because theres not enough information Let me give you some general guidance If you friends rash came on suddenly and she is experiencing a fever she should phone not go to an urgent care center right away for further evaluation Sometimes a rash like you describe can indicate a serious infection If your friends bumps have been slowly coming on over time and shes not having any flulike symptoms then she should see a health care provider to evaluate what might be causing this rash Many things can cause the symptoms you describe including acne Only a health care provider can say for certain what is going on and this evaluation needs to be done in person Hope this helps Im so sorry you lost your aunt Its always difficult to lose a loved one You have my sympathy The good news is theres probably nothing seriously wrong with your ear or your hearing Everyone has those episodes you describe where your hearing suddenly goes out and is replaced by a loud ringing or pulsing sound We dont know what causes that Could be a sudden shift in blood pressure could be some impacted ear wax suddenly pulling away from the eardrum Who knows If youre truly concerned I suggest you make a visit to your primary healthcare providers office for a checkup Make sure your blood pressure is normal and that you dont have an ear infection or any impacted cerumen wax A regular physical exam will cover all these bases Wishing you well To be honest Id have this checked out Chronic can be caused by an injury like the one you describe Its even possible you suffered a small fracture At any rate the sooner you have it checked out the more effective treatment might be at heading off ongoing problems You dont need to rush to the emergency room but you might call your primary care provider for an evaluation He or she might want to take an Xray just to be sure theres no break Your provider also can give you more specific information about the prognosis Good luck to you Im sorry you experienced this It sounds scary The good news is people usually dont just drop dead suddenly in the manner you describe I wonder if you mean you felt lightheaded when you got out of bed This is not uncommon It can be caused by a blood pressure change from lying down to standing If you continue to have episodes like this please see a health care provider A physical examination will help discover the cause of the problem It also will give you peace of mind Take care Sorry youre experiencing this Unfortunately its impossible to diagnose your condition without a physical exam I suggest you consult a dermatologist Its true this could be something simple along the lines of  which is a buildup of skin oils and cells It also could be dandruff or  Neither of those is lifethreatening but it would be useful to get a true diagnosis because these conditions require different treatment Skin cancers are uncommon in your age group but it still wouldnt hurt to have a dermatologist take a look at your scalp just to be safe Hope this helps Im sorry to hear youre going through this Sinus pain can feel so miserable is an inflammation swelling of the tissue that lines the This swelling of the tissue can cause the cavities to fill with fluid which causes pressure and pain and sometimes an infection Sinusitis can be caused by allergies nasal polyps a deviated septum or even smoke in the environment I hope your doctor has examined you to see if you have  While polyps arent extremely common in 14 year olds theyre not unheard of If you have not been examined for polyps you might ask your parents to get you an appointment with an earnosethroat doctor for an exam Meanwhile there are some things you can try at home to relieve your symptoms including Using a vaporizer warm mist in your bedroom be sure to clean it regularly because these devices can sometimes grow mold Inhaling steam such as from a pan of hot not boiling water Warm compresses wash rag soaked in very warm water laid across the eyesbridge of the nose Saline nose drops available over the counter If there is a smoker in your household this could be a cause of your symptoms If possible spend as much time as you can in a smokefree environment Because pets and other allergies can make sinusitis symptoms worse try to keep your bedroom petfree and make sure to vacuum or mop and dust regularly I hope one or more of these tips brings you some relief Im confused If the MRI showed bilateral  why would you believe thats not the cause of your symptoms Mastoiditis is an infection of the skull bone that lies just behind the ear It normally is treated with oral antibiotics because its a bacterial infection Ear drops also are frequently used If you have any questions about your diagnosis or treatment you should call your health care providers office for a call back or to make an appointment to see your doctor Best wishes to you Im sorry to hear youre going through this Its bad enough getting weird lumps and bumps in other places let alone in our genital region The only way to be certain what this is is to get a physical exam It certainly could be something like  which causes genital warts And if it is HPV youd definitely want to know Of course it also could be something else entirely But because of the potential for this to be an STD you need to get checked out Also you should avoid having sex until you know what this is Even if your male partner uses a condom he may not be completely protected due to the location of this bump If its something contagious you obviously dont want to give it to someone else Thats why Id recommend you avoid having sex altogether until you know for sure what youre dealing with Id suggest you make an appointment with your gynecologist or a local womens health clinic to have this looked at Wishing you all the best Im sorry youve been going through this and want to tell you youve suffered long enough Its time to get you some help The behavior youre describing can be caused by a few different things Id suggest you begin by seeing your primary health care provider to rule out any sort of neurological problem If you get a clean bill of health then Id suggest you see a counselor or psychotherapist Many people cope with stress by hitting or cutting themselves so please do not feel embarrassed to seek help for this problem Sometimes the issue can be solved with just a few visits to a therapist Other times it may take a bit longer You dont deserve the abuse youre experiencing You deserve relief from this behavior I urge you to seek attention for this Be well Id suggest you get this looked at Chances are its a common wart or something benign but theres always a possibility its a skin cancer Obviously youd want to treat that right away No need to rush to the emergency room Id suggest you make an appointment with a dermatologist or your primary care provider Meanwhile try not to scratch it squeeze it or pick at it Any of that type of behavior can break open the skin and make it easy for bacteria to enter You dont want to get a skin infection on top of this Feel free to wash or shampoo as normal This should not cause any ill effects to the bump Be a bit careful combing or brushing your hair so you dont catch the bump on the implement and tear it off or something Hope this helps What youre describing sounds perfectly normal During sex all women go through an arousal stage where glands around the opening to the vagina secrete lubricating fluid It sounds like you produce plenty of lubricating fluid which helps make intercourse nonpainful If the discharge you describe only occurs during foreplay and not at other times you shouldnt have anything to worry about On the other hand if you have vaginal discharge during the day discharge that smells bad or is yellowishgreenish in color discharge that looks like cottage cheese or vaginal itching then you should see a health care provider Using a condom can help prevent pregnancy and the spread of sexually transmitted diseases STDs I suggest you see a health care provider who can give you all the details about contraception birth control and STDs I dont know what these bumps are but I suggest you see a medical professional for a diagnosis In general its a bad idea to squeeze or pop skin bumps or lesions because when you do this you create a hole in the skin that infectious bacteria can enter through This can lead to an infection loss of skin scarring etc Lumps on the scalp arent exactly uncommon Its possible these are cysts or lipomas Only a health care provider can say for sure All the best to you Certainly this is something worth investigating Its impossible to tell what may be causing this without a physical examination but one possibility that comes to mind is  Id suggest you start by consulting your primary health care provider He or she can do a physical examination and possibly take an Xray to determine if you have arthritis in your neck vertebrae or possibly degenerative disc disease If you do your provider can discuss treatment options with you Hope this helps Sorry youre going through this misery First lets not jump to the conclusion this is  though it certainly sounds like it could be Id suggest you see a medical professional for an accurate diagnosis As you know if it is shingles you may be able to take a prescription medication to help with the pain If its not shingles your health care provider may be able to provide you with treatment for whatever it actually is Try to refrain from pulling your hair out as this can cause permanent loss of hair in those areas Also remember shingles in the blister stage is contagious and can cause someone whos never had to come down with the illness To help avoid this make sure youre washing your hands thoroughly and often Also do not share any combs brushes or other personal hygiene implements I hope you get a diagnosis quickly My short answer to your question is this Any time youve got a lump on the head and youre worried about it its OK to go see the doctor A major point I want to make is this Never take a bloodthinning pain reliever such as Advil ibuprofen also goes by the name Motrin aspirin brand names Excedrin Bufferin Anacin etc or naproxyn brand names Alleve Naprosyn after hitting your head These medications can cause bleeding which could turn a notsoserious injury into a very serious injury Im glad your husband seems to be doing fine and its always better for the swelling to be on the outside of the skull than the inside However if your husband has the black dots at the center of his eyeball slurred speech or loss of balance you should take him to the doctor right away These can be signs of a more serious head injury With a bruise the size youre describing its likely your husband has suffered a  These may range from mild to severe Again if you have any concerns about the extent of his head injury your safest bet is always to seek medical attentionSince its been more than 24 hours since the accident you dont need to rush to the emergency room But you definitely can get evaluated at an urgent care facility or ask your primary care provider to work your husband in for an appointment soon Best wishes to you Well its impossible to say what has caused your red spots without an examination but I wouldnt jump right to staph So many things can cause flaky red patches on the face including as you pointed out eczema If gentle cleansing and applying skin lotion or cream doesnt help you might get it checked out by a doctor just to be safe This illustrates common adult skin conditions though it doesnt include a picture of a staph infection of the skin I hope the patches clear up soon You were wise to get this situation checked out because it is possible for a person to leak cerebrospinal fluid CSF through a nostril and this is a dangerous situation that can lead to a serious infection of the membranes that surround the brain However since youve had a battery of tests done that have shown the fluid leaking from your nose is not CSF then you can rest assured your brain is fine The fluid coming from your nose must be normal  Many people myself included suffer from a chronically runny nose Clear fluid coming from the nose can indeed be caused by allergies There also is an interesting condition called gustatory rhinitis which is fancy talk for getting a runny nose while eating Since your runny nose comes and goes it does sound like it could be seasonal allergies Only your health care providers can solve this mystery for you I wish you all the best Its hard to answer a question like this without a physical examination I can give you some general thoughts on this matter 1 What youre observing could be perfectly normal A vein can appeal to be bulging if a person has very pale skin for example You might look to see if the corresponding vein on the opposite side also appears to be bulging Or you might gently press on the vein to see if it feels engorged and stiff especially as compared to the same vein on the left If so then Id suggest you see your primary care provider 2 High blood pressure can cause veins all over the body to bulge Its not uncommon to see bulging veins in the head due to high blood pressure Thats another reason why if the vein truly is bulging it would be a good idea to see a doctor Please note Im not trying to give any advice specific to your situation These are just general observations Whenever youre experiencing something out of the ordinary or something you feel is abnormal its always OK to see a doctor or other health care provider for an evaluation Wishing you all the best Interestingly yes the two things could be related And you should get this checked out by a doctor as soon as you can Under certain circumstances its possible for the uninjured eye to react to an injury to the opposite eye This is a condition that needs to be treated because it can get worse Usually though this sort of situation occurs when theres a fairly serious injury to the opposite eyeball itself Thus the symptoms youre experiencing in the right eye could indicate a more serious injury than you thought to the left eye While this isnt an emergency Id recommend you see a doctor at your earliest convenience to find out whats going on No sense taking chances with your vision Best to you Not sure is a friend Hi get doctor to check if you have a perforated ear drum as this might be a possibility I dont know why but almost everyone in my Mothers family including my brothers and I normal body temperature is well below 986 degrees In fact Ive had temps of 966 taken in the hospital on a regular basis Can you be any more specific in describing what you termed a bad move  Its called a tension headache or a stress headache   you can get rid of it by getting a massage or getting meds for it some triggers are I know you can get them from bad knees or hips Good luck heres a good site that I used for info httpwwwmayocliniccomhealthtensionheadacheDS00304METHODprint I would be careful taking Maxalt daily on a regular basis This medication is not designed or recommended for daily use It is to be taken within the first hour of migraine symptoms It doesnt prevent the onset but rather helps to relieve symptoms from the migraine I would seek a second medical opinion about using Maxalt daily Hey this happened to me before I seen a doctor and he said its from 3 things 1 not showing enough 2 sweating 3 its kinda weird when he told me but he says its also from Jerking offto much  Have you got your eyes checked lately That can cause headaches You shold go to a doctor as soon as possible It might be nothing so dont worry about it too much but its better to be safe than sorry first put alcohol on it and if it dosent drop off then scrap it with a credit card then if that doesnt work either pry it off with tweasers if it doesnt come out after all that go to the doctor theyll get it out  That was more then likely the pain It could be any of the things that you mention including a yeast or bacterial infection or even an STD  but thats something that only a trip to the doctor can reveal My guess from the limited information available is that it is likely to be a skin irritation of some sort which can occur for a number of reasons If it is a skin irritation using a first rate penis health cream health professionals recommend Man1 Man Oil should help Look for one that includes a first rate emollient like shea butter as well as a powerful antioxidant like alpha lipoic acid Good luck Theres no way to know for sure without going to a doctor so if you want a definitive answer that is what you need to do It does sound like you are probably experiencing a simply skin reaction very common on the penis Common skin irritations often respond to a top notch penis nutrient cream health professionals recommend Man1 Man Oil Look for a cream that includes a natural emollient like shea butter Good luck I would ask your primary or OBGYN to do a blood test for your hormone levels I would also talk to your doctor about any medication you have been taking longterm andor currently taking include ANY over the counter meds vitamins and any supplements Yes it could I am experiencing the exact same thing I am 53 and never had Migraines in my life until I was involved in a car wreck and hit my head I now get Migraines frequentlysometimes 23 a week You need to see a physician about this IMMEDIATELY No You didnt mention your age however often as we get older we will experience hair loss in lots of areas The eyelash loss is puzzling and that would be a question I would ask my opthamologist use a very dramatic moisturizer I use multiple moisturizers and it seriously takes away my laugh lines and wrinkles And i smile ALL the time try using moisturizers that are for dry skin I use several natural oatmeal moistorizers that work and i use a heavy body butter around the area that i have most trouble with and a gentle baby lotion for the areas i dont have trouble with Your ear is connected to your Eustachian tube which on its turn connect to your pharynx running close by your nose on its way The tube requires four essential muscles to operate I dont think a stroke would be the causeit could be the way you are different people get erections quicker than others while others slowerwhen you masturbait think about the women you like doing it for you that may train you when you see her to get an erectionare you masturbating properly Try a product called perla you can find it at a Mexican store or pharmacy Its a cream that I have tried and it works removing scars from my face I do recommend getting another doctors opinion It does seem like something that needs to be further evaluated However I would not assume he needs to see an oncologist just yet I recommend seeing another primary care pediatrician and going from there Have you seen a doctor for this That is a very long time to go on with this and not see a doctor I recommend going to see one asap Definitely see a doctor about this They might refer you to a neurologist if they think its needed I the same symptoms and more on top of those and I did need to have some tests done I would say to seek medical help ASAP It could be anything from a blood pressure problem to a seizure or stroke or could be something not as serious but get it checked out More Information If dye is involved you could be allergic to it Could have something to do with a nerve issue I think you should consult with your doctor The doctors initially diagnosed me with Undefined Vertiginous or Labyrinthine syndrome but i dont feel the world moving or me rotating Slowly in about a week my BP came down to 13080 and has been normal since Since then my condition became better and these complaints reduced But since then twice my pulse rate suddenly shot up with the same throbbing feeling in the head I had my menopause 4 years back Also I was on steamed vegetablesraw foods diet in March Also I never used to burp but now I do quite frequently and acid also comes up with itAlso after switching to normal food for about 20 days my diaphragm kept fluttering The doctors said that there is nothing wrong with me medically But even after such a long time this is still not going What could possibly be wrong I am NOT a Dr but I have experienced severe head trauma  surgery If you have insurance or can afford it I would highly recommend seeing a neurologist  having an MRI or Cat Scan Just to be on the safe side  for your own reassurance My son had problems with his lymph nodes swelling and after the fear of lymphoma we found out that the cause was infection Hopefully your outcome will be something easy to fix I just got cured of it less than 15 minutes ago Mine took 2 months and only because I just had it pop back in during my sleep I just woke up from feeling the same pull and hearing the same pop as I let out a high pitched shriek and instantly realized that I had lifted my arm up over my head same position of how I hurt it see below and I felt immediate relief Im right handed and it was my right arm so I was constricted from regular normal use for closing a car door and even sleeping Maybe HeShes Had The Tummy Flu It may be due to TMJ I had a swollen lymph node in my neck left side for months and then it disappeared The diagnosis was TMJ Studies do not show that saw palmetto reduces prostatitis symptoms Saw palmetto has been shown in some small studies to help symptoms caused by an enlarged prostate benign prostatic hyperplasia These symptoms include weak urine stream and frequent urination There are other studies that do not show that saw palmetto is an effective treatment for these symptoms Prostatitis is sometimes but not always caused by an infection Often treatment will consist of several weeks to months of antibiotic therapy if it thought to be a result of infection Its good that you are seeing a Urologist for evaluation and treatment Your doctor should also be able to recommend treatment for your pain if you are not already taking pain medication httpmenwebmdcomtcprostatitistreatmentoverview Our doctor prescribed Triamcinolone Acetonide Ointment 01 and we used it twice a day It got rid of the rash and we started using a chin guard sleeve so that no matter what there is no skin in contact with the sweaty chin guard the rash will stay away then Nike makes soccer chin guard sleeves and sells them at Dicks I meant to add that they also make chin strap sleeves too my son plays lacrosse and they sell them in the lacrosse section or maybe online Use the medication and use the sleeve to get rid of the rash My daughter who has not had a baby has the mirena too She was implanted about 1yr ago Had heavy bleeding for the 1st few months with huge clotting I actually would have to pull the clot out of her and took her to the dr with the samples Now she only spots for few days  sometime with clots and sometimes no clots I think since you stopped nursing your hormones are changing again and that why you started spotting My daughter sometimes spots or has a period I dont think anything is wrong Soon your uterus will adj to the medication and your periodsspotting will go away Thats what the dr informed us would happen wmy daughter She loves the mirena for the most part She doesnt like the thickened discharge or the spotting which comes and goes She doenst have her period anymore just spotting But its better than having a baby or hormones going through your whole body like the pill or depo With the mirena the hormones are confined to just your uterus Youll be fine  soon it will go awayit just take a litlle bit of time for your body to adj Really late on answering this question but thought it might help others I had that some years ago and it was after being in the ER and having injections in my IV port which went directly into my arm It caused severe pain and I could feel the pain travel up my arm as the medication went in I had an ultrasound done some weeks later from the pain that didnt go away and I had what I call like a rubber band as tight as could be that you could feel from my fore arm all the way into my armpit I ended up with phlebitis and blood clots in my arm from it all I had to give myself 2 injections of lovenox a day for 2 weeks to dissolve the blood clots Go see your Doctor is my best advice So dude it might be something like acne or just Fordyce

provides more information on Eating Right to Keep Hair Healthy Absolutely You always need to let your doctor know if you are not getting better There can be many reasons a treatment doesnt work Your doctor will make sure that the diagnosis is correct Sometimes a new problem has appeared that is complicating your condition Other tests such as labwork or xrays may be needed to see what is going on Then he or she will consider other treatment options Sometimes a different antibiotic is necessary or a longer course of therapy The doctor may suggest other things you can be doing at home to make yourself feel better Here is more information about Help for Sinus Pain and Pressure If you still are not getting any better ask for a referral to an ears nose and throat specialist I am glad that you are feeling better Earaches can be pretty miserable An earache often follows a cold or allergy flareup Heres what happens Normally the middle ear is kept free of fluid by a tiny tube called the Eustachian tube This tube drains the fluid out of the middle ear into the back of the throat A cold or allergy can cause this tube to become inflamed and swollen This traps fluid in the middle ear behind the eardrum This fluid can then get infected with bacteria or viruses causing pressure and pain Earaches often do get better on their own after a few days But often some of the fluid is left behind This fluid can again become a breeding ground for another infection It can also interfere with your hearing WebMD has a good slideshow that shows exactly what happens with an ear infection Have your doctor take a look to see what is going on Depending on the cause there may be medications or prescription nasal sprays that can help If this is a persistent problem ask to see an ear nose and throat specialist Rarely a tube may need to be inserted into the eardrum to get rid of the fluid Without being able to examine you its impossible to tell what might be going on You should make an appointment with your doctor If your penis is changing colors and developing cracks that is something that should be checked out to determine the cause and any necessary treatment There are many potential causes to this including a nerve problem Given how long its lasted and the fact that is hasnt gone away its time to get your doctor to check you out You need to have an examination by your doctor to determine what followup tests you may need to get to the bottom of the pain As you said these arent typical headaches and the description of your symptoms does not automatically point to something in particular It definitely sounds like it could be an abdominal hernia This most commonly happens around the belly button or in a previous site of surgery While most hernias are harmless some can be dangerous Its best to get your doctor to check it out to make sure its nothing that needs treatment right now Possibly a stomach ulcer worst case scenario stomach cancer Emergency room time for sure though I wish the best for you and your son Yes Go to the Doctor possible infection It would depend on how hard you hit your head Did you break the skin or do you have a big gash What symptoms are you experiencing If you are feeling dizzy are losing vision having a severe headache or throwing up Then yes I would suggest you go see a doctor Hope this is helpful My daughter plays fast pitch softball and had the same symptoms She caught a line drive up the middle and flung it side armed at 1st She said she felt a pop When it didnt go away after two days we took her to a orthopedic He said it was strained and would be fine after a two week rest After the rest she was pitching and she caught another line drive on the pitchers mound She felt something pull and we noticed her arm slump and she said she couldnt move it We took her to a different doctor He did a MRI that showed a tear in her Labrumthe ligament that holds the arm in the socket If you continue to have this issue and they havent checked that yet you may want to ask the doc about it If she tears hers again she will have to have surgery I wish you good luck and a speedy recovery Hi can your

week following moderate use of the drug many MDMA users report feeling a range of emotions including anxiety restlessness irritability and sadness that in some individuals can be as severe as true clinical depression Similarly elevated anxiety impulsiveness and aggression as well as sleep disturbances lack of appetite and reduced interest in and pleasure from sex have been observed in regular MDMA users Some of these disturbances may not be directly attributable to MDMA but may be related to some of the other drugs often used in combination with MDMA such as cocaine or marijuana or to

Hi The first thing is it just tight or attached This next bit I coped from the NHS very British Phimosis is not usually a problem unless it is causing symptoms If symptoms are present the tight foreskin is probably the result of irritation from urine or an infection and you will need to see your GP Treating the irritation or infection will usually clear the problem If there is swelling soreness and redness around the glans and foreskin sometimes with a thick discharge under the foreskin the cause is probably balanitis Balanitis is not serious and can usually be cured with bathing A steroid cream may need to be applied and antibiotics are sometimes necessary The most common cause of balanitis in young boys is not getting rid of excess urine from the end of the penis after urinating Balanitis can sometimes be confused with a urinary tract infection which causes pain when urinating a feeling of needing to urinate urgently and blood in the urine This will need treatment with antibiotics So is this of any help Good Luck Hi Get to an STDGUM Clinic and get some tests done the staff there will treat you well Good Luck Hi I do think you may have to think of cosmetic surgery to over come you problem Or just do the manly thing and live with it tell people you had a lobotomy but would you remember that Good Luck Hi Found this for you it may help you and your problem The exact cause of fibromyalgia is unknown Research into people with fibromyalgia has identified a number of changes in the way their body functions However what causes these changes and how these cause fibromyalgia is still not clear The rest of this can be found on this link httpwwwnhsukConditionsFibromyalgiaPagesCausesaspx I do hope this helps you Good Luck well like i said ive been too busy at the job so havent masturbated in over a month I noticed it when the morning wood started turning into morning rubber  Acne scars will fade with age however you can make them fade faster with laser treatment Talk to your dermatologist about it As for the small pimpletype bumps your dermatologist could prescribe you a topical cream If you dont know what it it then I would leave it alone and consult with your dermatologist in person Could just be a small acne outbreak or ingrown hairs Oh wow you should still go see a doctor That sounds pretty serious and even if it was 10 days ago you should still go get it checked to be sure If you havent tried any medications for this disorder then I would recommend speaking with your doctor about getting on an antianxiety medication like clonazepam  A lot of times there are things in our life that can increase our anxiety and cause panic attacks If you have a particularly stressful job then you may need to consider scaling back your work or even moving into another field of work that wont affect your physical and mental health If medication does not work for you then it would be a good idea to start seeing a therapist or psychiatrist possibly on a weekly basis or more to start to work through the triggers that cause anxiety and panic episodes It could just be a bug bite like a mosquito or some kind of fly It is probably something called a milia which is basically a small cyst that is not harmful Its common in newborns but can also appear on adults If it bothers you you can talk to your dermatologist about removing it sry new at this site  Since you posted this today I truly hope you have made up your mind to make an appointment on Monday for your son to see a doctor preferably a pediatrician as soon as possible Children rarely complain of headaches without reason Yes it may be possible however it may also be a skin condition that has been dormant for some time caused from over exposure to UVIR rays You should consult a Dermitologist to be sure assuming that it is iodine 131 it could cause damage to the thyroids and increase cancer risk i am not sure if there is a non radio active for of iodine dye find out which one it is and use discretion im no medical doctor or anything but it sounds like it could have something to do with a nerve You should be checked out to be sure you dont have a concussion You may have strained your neck more likely than any kind of spinal injury but conking your head could have resulted in a bruise on the brain  thats what a concussion is and you dont need to have lost consciousness to have one I had a number of concussions that were not treated in the past and regretted it Its better to check it out than to be sorry After all your brain is the most important organ in your body A promptcare location or your local ED should check out your head and neck In the meantime put some ice in a baggie and rest it gently against your head Keep your head elevated Dont take any meds that could fog your head and make a diagnosis difficult Good Luck There are some forms of cardiac arrhythmia  including PAT paroxysmal atrial tachycardia and supraventricular tachycardia  that can cause those symptoms they can be diagnosed by a cardiologist using a Holter monitor test and there are other conditions including high blood pressure all of which might have been brought to light by hormonal changes following your recent pregnancy The best place to start is with your primary care provider It could be that you may need to take a mild dose of a Betablocker such as Metoprolol Tartrate which I take Once your doctors have ruled out anything more serious something along those lines could be of great help If there is an endocrine imbalance your doctor might decide to send you to an endocrine specialist but because of the recent pregnancy be sure to keep your OBGYN in the loop Good Luck In the meantime be sure to sleep with your head elevated slightly and it might help a little if you dont lie on your back it puts a little more stress on your mitral valves With fever that high you may even want to consider the ER Fever of 104 and above could be very dangerous If you can find an emergency walkin clinic tomorrow assuming the fever subsides you could save a few dollars by going there instead You need to get that fever down though first and foremost and do it ASAP I assume that you did not get a flu shot and do not actively supplement with those vitamins and minerals known to bolster the immune system I take zinc vitamin C probiotics and vitamin d3 and I never get the flu or any other disease for that matter And yes vitamin D3 does in fact prevent the flu and most everything else Source httpvitamind3blogcom c4ncer You are gay It could be a pinched nerve or God forbid an aneurysm PLEASE see your doctor or go to the emergency room immediately This is NOT something you want to take any chances with You are the best advocate for your health take advantage of that and take care of any problems that come up with your health  and take any preventative measures to make sure you stay healthy 1st  stop doing Zumba until you see your doctor to figure out whats going on 2nd  see your doctor or get to an emergency room asap dont mess around with your health This could be something very serious Hope everything goes well There are MANY causes for itchy scalps but dry skin would be high on the list as well as chemical sensitivity reactions to shampoo fungal scalp infections and yes even head lice It is not possible to determine a specific cause based on itching alone He will need to see a medical provider or dermatologist for a proper examination but in the meantime he can try some medicated overthecounter shampoo used for dry scalp conditions to see if it helps A pharmacist can help him chose a proper one Otitis media is a MIDDLE EAR INFECTION usually treated with antibiotics not drops A loud ringing could be tinnitus often caused by an INNER EAR condition not something that drops would help Coupled by this unusual painpressure in your head it would be prudent to consider a higherlevel medical evaluation from an Ear Nose and Throat ENT specialist It would not be possible to determine a cause of your head pressure blindly over the Internet If the bleeding was from the same side of the nose you may be experiening ONE nose bleed that has recurred three times This happens when the scab that forms either fails to adhere to the slippery mucous lining and bleeds again or a probing finger dislodges it As long as your child is not bruised in other areas or anemic nose bleeds are often more annoying than serious You do need to know the proper way of controlling the bleeding so check on the WebMD site for nosebleeds and you will find some helpful information With that said I am a bit concerned about the head injury Since I have no way to take a more thorough medical history or examine him this should be address with his medical provider Please dont try and post the pictures Pictures may be worth a thousand words but if the picture of genitalia those words may not be appropriate The penis is covered by skin and the skin is capable of all kinds of skin conditions including pimples tiny sebaceous oil gland cysts folliculitis hair follicules heat rashes eczema etc Many of these little bumps are completely innocent You cannot accurately diagnose ANY skin condition based solely on a description so it is off ot your primary care or better yet a urologist  someone who specializes in the this part of the anatomy Rather than stress out over selfdiagnoses it would be best to have an answer from a medical specialist  one who can see these bumps firsthand You did the right thingyou saw a urologist for a proper examination Yes prostatitis can cause some but not all of your symptoms so please finish that course of antibiotics A person can have more than one issue going on at the same time so please keep in mind that burning on urination as well as irritated or sensitive penis tip can be a chemical sensitivity new deterrgent or dryer softener or a condition called balanitis Have you tried a topical overthecounter steroid cream Make sure to always use a condom so you will not have to worry about a sexuallytransmitted disease next time I am glad that your chlamydia and gonorrhea tests were negative but you may not be so lucky next time Prostatitis should not cause rednesssoreness at the tip of the penis so you are correct There is likely another cause Unfortunately it would not be possible to determine a specific cause blindly over the Internet based solely on your very brief description You will need to see your medical provider again not just because of this rednesssoreness but because you apparently have not responded to three weeks of antibiotics for your prostatitis You may want to consider seeing a urologist Read about alopecia areata Assuming this boy is not pulling out his own hair a nervous habit alopecia areata tinea capitus and other skin disorders should be considered I dont knowI have no way of seeing or examining your penis Your description is just too vague for me or any medical provider to make a blind guesslet alone a diagnosis As embarrassing as this may be for you the only way to have a definitive answer is to be examined Based on what you stated it would not be likely that you have an STD or anything serious There are many innocent skin lesions that can appear on the skin of the penis includingzits Clearly you are concerned so please get it checked out You do not have to treat a fever  especially one this low Fever is the bodys normal response to fighting off an infection or inflammation It is okay to give her some ibuprofen much better than acetaminophenTylenol to make her feel better but you do not have to treat a fever Fevers are not only harmless they are therapeutic The cause of a fever can be in the thousands so please see her medical provider if she continues to be ill after two more days or any time that you feel it is needed Yes your finger could be broken IF the xrays did not clearly show your finger The palm of your hand is a different area called the metacarpals so make sure the xray viewed this area as well or you may need another film Sprains do not show up on xraysjust bones Since I cant examine you you may need to see a medical provider again if the treatment is not helping Dont do your own penis surgery That would be stupid Obviously I cant see what you are talking about but you may have a penile bridge you can look this up on the Internet or a remnant from a circumcision A penile bridge can be cut by a urologist under a local anesthetic but to do it yourself would not be in your best interest These things are common and are not awkward to discuss with your medical provider Do the right thing and see a professional Cervical neck disc disease will not cause thigh pain but degenerative disc disease in your low back lumbar area could certainly do this If you have not had imaging studies of your low back this should be done I think any person with a significant head injury that may have been a concussion should be medically evaluated The fact that you are still having postinjury headaches dizziness and nausea indicates a need to be carefully examined How did it happen Depending on the strain of Staph MRSA it may have been hospitalacquired There are also communityacquired strains but based on your posting of multiple antibiotics and a rarely used one I suspect that she had a hospitalacquired MRSA As much as I would like to address your concern my worried friend there is absolutely NO WAY for me to blindly make any type of determination about this mysterious bump You have seen multiple doctors but unfortunately this medical provider cant see it to offer an opinion If this i on your skin see a dermatologist Maybe she wants some real food like many of the things you are eating Many babies reject processed baby food Have you tasted it so try preparing some of your own or start feeding her some safe foods from your plate She doesnt need teeth for many of those things Dont give her too many different foods at one time remember that breast milk or formula is still very important and follow her pediatricians recommendation on when to start safe solids but now may be the time She watches what you eat so this may be her way of saying How come if have to eat this stuff in a jar FYI My daughter did the same thing Some higher estrogen birth control pills can cause an acne flairup Talk to the medical provider that prescribed them to see if a change in pill is in order or a different acne medication regime I am not an attorney but if diagnostic mistakes were made you may have a case The most important thing for you to do right now of course is to focus on treating and curing your cancer Filing or even winning a malpractice suit does not change the fact that you have a very serious disease that requires proper treatment You should not get signs of syphilis like a chancre in just two days And yes you will need a blood test to determine if you have syphilis RPR A special urine test can detect Chlamydia and gonorrhea Where you checked for herpes The only definite 100 way of determining if a skin lesion is a skin cancer or not is with a biopsy Either the entire lesion  or a piece of the lesion is removed and analyzed by a pathology lab A skilled clinician like a dermatologist can give you a prettygood idea but a visual inspection can be wrong Because of your family history of melanoma it would be wise to get it checked out You should just take the Tylenol like your doctor suggested Medications like ibuprofen and Aleve all have the potential of causing bleeding just like aspirin There is nothing over the counter If you need something stronger than Tylenol you will need to contact your medical provider for a prescription perhaps one that has codeine The amount of radiation involved in a CT scan would not justify the use as a screening test for the general population It would probably cause more cancer than it would find There are very specific symptoms and signs that would indicate an intracranial problem so it would be best to screen these patients first with a neurological exam rather than just recommending that all people get a brain CT scanjust like a pap smear or mammogram Whole body rash and itching is NOT shingles Is it possible that your doctors diagnosis was incorrect You may need to see him again Shingles is PAINFUL not itchyand it only affects a section of ONE SIDE of the body it follows a nerve pathway That would be a reasonable course of action Sinusitis can be a bit tricky to treat and often one course of antibiotics may not do it In light of the fact that you are still having facial pain and pressure and are still congested and coughing you may need further care  perhaps a stronger or different antibiotic assuming you had an antibiotic the first round and something more to control your symptoms It could be the soap you are using in the shower or you just have atopic dermatitis a dry skin condition There are prescription creams and ointments that can be prescribed by your medical provider if your over the counter efforts are not helping Yeast can occur on the skin anywhere on the body but I would have no idea based on your description alone if yeast is an underlying culprit This problem has been going on for months now See a dermatologist or your primary care providerless expensive than moving to Canada NoThere are no bursas in this area but you can get neck pain for a variety of other reasons and causes It would be wise to see your medical provider so that you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated What KIND of medication You may have a common case of balanitis due to yeast or even a bacterial infection but unfortunately this would take an examination to definitively determine  not something that can be accomplished over the Internet See your medical provider so you can be properly diagnosed and treated It may be all in your head but unless you saw a cardiologist had an chest xray andor echocardiogram there is no way to know if someone has an enlarged heart or any other type of heart anomaly by just looking at the chest wall These sudden deaths of heatlhy people do happen unfortunately and many never knew they had a problem Have a good physical exam If you have a family history of cardiac problem get a clearance from a cardiologist Since you are so worried this may relieve your anxiety Calamine may help but shaving against the grain may have resulted in a condition called folliculitis  a skin infection that involves the hair follicles An antibacterial cream may be preferable There is really little that I can do blindly over the Internet since I have no way of examining your skin eruption A visual exam is essential to make an accurate diagnosis Failure to improve on your current treatment may indicated that the diagnosis was incorrect or the treatment was not appropriate Your only course of action is to be examined again or see a dermatologist for a higherlevel diagnostic opinion No A sty would not cause this other pain Cradle cap seborrheic dermatitis will selfresolve in time and should not leave any permanent skin discoloration He needs to see a neurologist  They will not cure his stubborness however but they may be able to determine the cause of his symptoms and perhap find a solution It is interesting that you used the term penalty of death since these symptoms could indeed be serious and his failure to take care of himself by seeing a specialist could have dire consequences I have no way of blindly determining the reasons for your granddaughters loss of consciousness over the Internet based solely on your very brief posting She will need to be carefully evaluated by a medical profession either at an emergency room or primary care office Without the ability to examine you I really have no way to know if you have balanitis or not Dont post a picture Uncircumcised men are more prone to balanitis caused by yeast which likes warm dark moist places but this tends to itch and become red If you are just noticing a white area just watch it for a while If it persists you would need to see your medical provider or a urologist but it sounds innocent Hopefully you are using a condom Head lice originates from other people who have head lice You would have to be a forensic anthropologist to know when this began but I suspect even cavemen had head lice or perhaps even Cain and Abel Adam and Eves boys Head lice have been around for as long as there have been people There are no penis health creams As far as the color of your penis is concerned I am at a loss to comment since there is no ability to properly examine you via the Internet a photo would NOT help either Your vague description that your penis looks freaky does not help narrow down the many dermatological possibilities that can cause skin color changes so I would suggest that you SEE a medical professional such as a dermatologist  one who can examine the skin on your penis As you may know I cant blindly diagnose you over the Internet but I can tell you that chicken pox lesions look like dew drops on a rose petal tiny blister on a red base Herpes zoster the same virus also tends to have blisters at first but in groups These are painful and only ONE side of the body Pimples and white heads do not sound herpetic to me I dont recommend that you perform any type of selfsurgery on your penis It doesnt cost that muchor is it that involved to have a professional do this for you painlessly and without a risk of infection I dont have enough information to be able to answer that question I do not know the type of seizures you are having and of course I have no way of examining you to determine if your onesided headaches have anything to do with this condition There are hundreds of different types of headaches You would need to consult your medical provider  someone who is familiar with you and your case and someone that has the ability to examine you Two things First a CT scan is the definitive test for sinusitis If it was clear then I would question that he is having sinus headaches There are a hundreds of different types of headaches so consider seeing a neurologist for a higherlevel evaluation Second taking decongestants at night is not a good idea because of their stimulent effect and the fact they cause annoying drainage An antihistamine may be considered or perhaps a trial of using nasal corticosteroid sprays to reduce the inflammation You would first need to see a dermatologist to have this hairloss problem properly diagnosed Dandruff typically does not cause hair loss but it can be treated with the right combination of medications usually special shampoos Fungal scalp infections are not common but can be contributory Many times people who feel they are having hair loss do not Hair in the resting stage will often break off or shed This is normal Unless you are seeing patchy areas of baldness then your hair may be just fine Talk to your parents about having a consultation with a dermatologist I think this problem can be rectified There is really nothing nonsurgical that can permanent fix asymmetrical breast sizes Sure you can use padding on the smaller side to fill the gap in the bra but that does not alter your selfimage when that bra is removed Just about every female patient that I have had over the years who underwent a breast surgery for enlargement making them firmer after a few kids or even having a breast reduction are happy Prices vary on this cosmetic procedure but so do prices on used cars You can spend 5000 a guess since the price varies on a boobjob or 5000 a used car The breast job does not require gasoline insurance or much maintenance and will last a lifetime The car It will eventually fall apart You can get a car loan to buy ityou can get a boob loan to pay for surgery if this is important to you You will likely be glad that you did and your husbandI dont think he will be complaining very much I know that money can be tight but making a modest monthly payment to pay off your new breasts is really something I think most families can financially manage with a bit of planning You had two childrenyour deserve it Many cosmetic surgeons have free consultations Make a few appointments and take your husband with you Assuming you are talking about a MIDDLE ear infection you should have experienced relief in three daysIF a you were properly and accurately diagnosed b your ear infection was due to a bacteria and not a virus and c the antibiotic you are taking was the proper choice and dosage Failure to respond to your treatment is a reason to call your medical provider for patientspecific advice Since you are still having dizziness and head pressure it would be wise to be reexamined Unfortunately there are no effective ways to remove the scar without a surgical procedure If you have a permanent scar since infancy all of the creams and overthecounter scar removal concoctions are not going to help You will not lose the scar just money See a plastic surgeon or a dermatologist for a consultation You will find that many of these cosmetic procedures are lessexpensive then getting a dent fixed in your car A plastic surgeon can literally cut out some scars in the office under a local anesthesia A dermatologist can do the same or use a technique called dermabrasion where the scar is more or less sanded off after a local anesthesia of course and the body is given a second chance to heal without a scar this time Each scar is different so the recommended procedure may be one of these or an entirely different approach It does cost very much for a consultation so consider doing it Sometimes This is called referred ear pain Because of the muscle connection from your neck to the area behind your ear the mastoid area pain in this sternocleidomastoid muscle can cause pain to be referred to the ear Pain can also be referred to the ear from problems in the mouth TMJ lymph nodes salivary glands and throat so if you are having problems in any of those areas please see your medical provider so you can be properly examined Dont forget that ear pain can also be a problem IN the ear too You may have an issue with the erectile tissue of the penisthe corpus cavernosa which fills with blood to achieve an erection There is a condition called that you should research Dont be embarrassed by this condition but you do need to see a good urologist so that you can be properly examined and diagnosed See your gynecologist to make sure there is not an underlying structrual or anatomical issue like a retroverted tilted uterus etc Unless your sexual partner is a trained psychotherapist he should not be diagnosing you with an emotional problem or implicate a trust issue Most of these issues can be solved but more information is needed Without the ability to see this scab firsthand please dont post a picture it would be very difficult if not impossible to offer you a patientspecific recommendation The penis is covered by skin and skin can become irritated for a variety of reasons so I would suggest that you see a medical professional to have this allimportant examination I cant answer that questionI am not sure what drug that came up positive the type of test you had blood urine hair how high those levels were or your honest and I mean HONEST drug history While drug tests have been known to come up falsenegative it is really up to you to explain to your new company what may have occurred Certain drugs can stay in your system for quite a while I dont have enough medical information to throw out profound answers but high on my list would be a neurological disorder perhaps a seizure problem Your child should be seen by a pediatric neurologist for a full diagnostic workup I can address your BPPV concerns but unfortunately it is not possible to predict how long you might have symptoms assuming you were correctly diagnosed BPPV has an annoying habit of coming back BPPV is an inner ear problem It does not cause palpitations or head rush and is not related to neck disorders so these symptoms are not likely associated Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo BPPV is the most common cause of vertigo The patient usually has episodes of recurring vertigo lasting several minutes or as brief as 15 seconds Specific movements of the head often provoke the attack usually following a brief delay of several seconds People quickly realize the specific head motion or motions which tends to trigger an attack There are effective treatments but you may need to see an ENT xmlnamespace prefix  o ns  urnschemasmicrosoftcomofficeoffice op sizsetfalse sizcache054537445470053730071828182845905 46 23 op There is really nothing overthecounter that you can buy that will remove any existing scars that you have but you can help prevent any NEW scars by not squeezing or picking your acne lesions anymore Hopefully you are on an effective acne medication regime under the care of a medical professional If you are still getting scaring it is important for you to see a good dermatologist Once you have outgrown your acne Be patient it does happen to most of us there are many thing that a skin specialist can do to get rid of those scars from chemical peels to dermabrasions You can certainly arrange a professional consultation now Since I do not know if you are male or female this may not be applicable to both sexes For women getting a makeup specialist involved can certainly help hide those scars until the time is appropriate to get them permanently removed We all tend to be our worst critic Dont let these blemishes change who you are When people look at you they do not look at your acne they look at your eyesand your smile Be happy with yourself and dont let your acne define who you are This is called  a common complication of your circumcision The ONLY way to fix this is to have it surgically corrected not something you can do at home Steroid creams often help with simple adhesions but not bridging So as soon as you get insurance go see a urologist and have it fixed permanently In most cases it is a simple office procedure under local anesthesia I am very sorry but a lowresolution picture is no substitute for a handson direct examination Subsequently I cannot specically comment about the nature of your tiny colorless forehead spots You did not ask a specific question but in order for you to be properly diagnosed and treated you will need to see a primary care medical provider or dermatologist Any boardcertified dermatologist should be able to help you with this longstanding skin problem It may have sometime to do with your fallwinter attire Many of these boils start out as folliculitis an infection around the hair follicles so heat andmoisture in this area can be contributory to seasonal outbreaks I dont know if you are shaving in this area but this too can be a factor Your husband needs to see a medical provider so these lumps possibly reactive lymph nodes or  can be properly examined diagnosed and treated It would not be possible to determine the true nature of them blindly over the Internet based solely on the brief information in your posting Men are stubborn and I suspect your husband is no different Make the appointment for him and take him even if he is kicking and complaining the entire way This is really the ONLY way to get these lumps properly assessed Of course you need to get it checked out I am surprised that it took you a year to get to this point There are many many causes of ear pain including many causes that do not involve the ear itself It is going to take a thorough systemic diagnostic workup to get to the bottom of this yearlong issue No In order for a medical provider to determine that nature of any skin lesion they would need to examine your son firsthand A vague description of sores just isnt specific enough to narrow down the many many possibilities I really want to answer this bizarre question but struggle with trying to take your question seriously First you did not cause brain damage from expelling gas unless the force of the fart launched you forward or into the air at great speed See this what I struggle with A sudden movement of the head or neck can cause a brief spasm of the neck muscles so I suspect this is what happened to you I trust you have fully recovered and that there are no unintentional collateral damage to your physical surroundings The penis has never been known for its beauty and appearance so dont worry about the wrinkles since only you are probably the only one seeing it A sexual partner is more likely to see or experience the nonwrinkled version There are not wrinkleremovers or penislifts so it is what it is No you cannot get pregnant from performing oral sex The cause of your acne that is worsening is not as important as the treatment Cystic acne is the type most likely to scar and most likely to need the services of a good dermatologist There are some wonderful medications available that can get your acne in control At age 15 both male and females have ranging hormones which is really the number one cause a cause that cannot be rectified at this time in your life since your hormones are providing some other essential functions right now If you are female certain oral contraceptives can help regulate those zitcausing female hormones For men there are no options to regulate testosterone the male hormone Think of your acne as a temporary sideeffect No There are not creams that can fix a wrinkled penis As much as I would like to help you it is not possible to blindly make a diagnosis over the Interneta medical provider would need to see and feel this lump in order to make an accurate determination And without a accurate diagnosis it would not be possible to suggest treatments A few suggestions First stop messing with it This could be a deep cyst sebaceous cyst or cystic acne By squeezing it you may make it worse or cause an infection Second either see your primary care medical provider or a dermatologist so that you can have an accurate diagnosis I cant imagine this lesion cannot be treated but you need that allimportant diagnosis first No it does not There are no rules in medicine that state a person can only have one medical issue at a time so you can have both but they are not related Not enough information Rather than spend your time in selfdiagnosis from the flu to reasons for your head pain like sinusitis it may be more beneficial for you to seek proper medical care You can see them but unfortunately I cannot Dermatological problems require a handson examination either your primary care provider or a dermatologist An accurate diagnosis  not something that I could blindly give you based solely on your very brief vague description  is the most important step in determining the proper treatment Maybe your doctor should refer you to a back specialist orthopedist for a higherlevel evaluation Musculoskeletal issues in the neck can be very complex so you will need a careful medical history thorough examination of your neckshoulders and most likely some imaging studies Dont ever worry about asking your doctor too many questions They are not working for freethey get wellpaid to address your concerns Melanoma is not contagious but open skin lesions can become secondarily infected with bacteriaand this bacteria can be transfered to others Talk to your parents and have them take you to see a medical provider right away It would be impossible to adequately evaluate a person with a headache blindly over the Interent let alone determine if they had a brain tumor You had UNPROTECTED sex It is your other head that I am concerned about this was not a good decision Why would you not use protection against pregnancy Even if you were both virgins assuming both are honest you still have the possibility of pregnancy If your penis is sore you will need to see a medical provider so that you can be properly examined There is absolutely no way to blindly guess the reason for your symptoms based solely on your vague statement Leave it alone There are natural adhesions attaching the head of the penis to the foreskin at this age Forcibly retracting the foreskin can be very painful so just clean what you can see It may be red because you are causing very tiny microtears in his foreskin Some children do have very tight foreskins so please allow the pediatrician to make that determination during an examination Most of the menboys in the world are uncircumcised just the way Nature made them As he ages those natural adhesions will resolve and his foreskin will completely retract If not there are prescription steroid creams that can be used to help it along In my pediatric practice I rarely intervene medically until age 7 or 8 unless the foreskin is supertight and it balloons when he urinates If this is the case a pediatric urologist should be consulted You will need to have your medical provider examine this area carefully Unfortunately your description is really not sufficient to make this important call Your scalp is really not connected to your brain but your scalp is rich in sensory nerves so forceful hairpulling may result in some residual discomfort as you have experienced Brain surgery 12 years ago should not preclude playful hairpulling but if this act causes you pain afterwards it should be avoided no matter how much you loved it I have used this antibiotic for 40 years and I have never had a person return with blue veins on the forehead This would not be a cephalexin drug reaction or side effect You should not have to pester your doctor to get care He is not doing it for freeYOU or your insurance company is paying him At this point you may need to ask for a referral to a neurologist for a higherlevel neurological evaluation Your mother needs to be seen and examined by a medical professional There is no way that the severity of her injuries could be determined blindly over the Internet You need to see a for an extensive array of testing These visits can last five or more hours and are expensive but insurances typically will pay for them with prior approval Dizziness vertigo is a very complex medical condition with hundreds of different causes involving nearly every body system It is very important for you to see a medical provider as soon as possible so that you can be properly evaluated diagnosed and treated There are no studies that show a relationship from a childhood head injury to true autism but that is something that a neurologist should answer since there are many different types of autism and not all head injuries are innocent There is nothing you can do to remove those keloidsnothing overthecounter and nothing magical The only chance of reducing the size of those keloids it to be under the care of a good dermatologist who is experienced in this area Some dermatologists will inject them with lowdose steroids but this is not something that you can do at home I cannot diagnose you blindly over the Internet so I would strongly suggest that you inform your parents immediately of your findings and concerns You need to see a medical provider for a proper examination If your tinnitus is related to your VNG test it should resolve in a few days to a week As you may know tinnitus is common in many inner ear disorders like Menieres It could be just be a coincidence that you have tinnitus today but then again it could have some unknown association People getting a VNG certainly can having dizziness or even nauseavomiting but tinnitus would not be a common test sideeffect You may have a medical condition called BALANITIS  Please see your medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated I think you mean psoriasis  a common dermatological condition that can appear on any skin surface including the scalp I am not sure what the inverse part is but then again I am not a dermatologist So to address your question Yes it is possible to have psoriasis on the scalp There are many different medications from steroid solutions to shampoos that can help and there are prescription and overthecounter medications to control the itching Give your dermatologist a call and ask for some help Assuming you are not hitting you head on the bed during this intimate moment one likely cause would be an orgasmic headache You can find information about this on an Internet search Keep in mind that there are hundreds of possibilitiesmuscle tension headaches a migrainelike vascular headache high blood pressure or  If this keeps happening it would be in your best interest to be professionally examined and diagnosed Seborrheic dermatitis seborrheic capitus is very common in children The causes are often undiscoverable so the focus is generally on the treatment Medicated shampoos both overthecounter and prescription are often used as well as prescription solutions containing topical cortisone Shampoos with selenium sulfide are particularly helpful in managing this skin condition It is NOT normal to continue to have ear pain five months after tube grommet insertion so I would suggest that you try and get a second opinion from another ENTsince two ENT heads are better than one The area behind the ear is the mastoid sinus but postauricular lymph nodes can also be painful Obviously ruling out mastoiditis  a complication of chronic middle ear infections  would be very important The leakage otorrhea is likely the drainage of fluid through the grommets from the middle ear space You may have sustained an acute allergic reaction to the hair coloring First never use this hair coloring again Second use a medicated shampoo used for dandruff or seborrheic dermatitis for the next week or so Third try to avoid scratching your scalp even though it itches This can further irritate and disrupt the skin surface An overthecounter antihistamine may help the itching If symptoms do not improve you will need to see a healthcare provider for a proper examination Secondary infections can occur those pimple like bumps anytime your skin surface has been damaged so antibiotics may be needed if you do not improve Get him in to see his medical provider RIGHT AWAY This is not normal and he will need to have some imaging studies of his brain MRI or CT or both as well as see a good pediatric neurologist You need to see a medical professional for a thorough examination There are many different types of headaches While migraines tend to be onesided getting a proper diagnosis with the TYPE of headache you have is very important when it comes to determining an effective treatment Because you are having visual issues your medical provider or neurologist may also want you to see a eye specialist Orcall the doctor again I am not sure of the reason for the antibiotic if the Strep test was negative That usually indicates a virus and viruses including mono do not respond at all to any antibiotic The reason for the continue fever may also indicate that an antibiotic may have been unnecessary but of course I wasnt there and cant see his throat With that said if he is in pain not swallowing having another examination is prudent He could still have mono since some early tests are false negative and not as accurate It is not possible to make a blind diagnosis of a dermatological problem I would need to examine your son which obviously I cannot Impetigo is a Staph Strep infection MRSA is a specific type of Staph infection Both can cause those symptoms and both would require a wound culture to make the diagnostic distinction If he is worried about MRSA the culture is essential Bactrim and Bactroban would treat Staph infection but Strep one cause of impetigo would not be improved by Bactrim Send him to Student Health or an Urgent Care facility so he can be examined tested and treated I am guessing that you have balanitis  perhaps balanitis due to a yeast monilial infection This is notorious for causing an itchy red penisThis is just a blind guess since I do not have any way of examining you over the Internet If this is indeed a monilial infection topical antifungal creams would be the treatment of choice Many good ones are available overthecounter Ask your pharmacist I am sorrybut if I cant see it or examine it I cant blindly offer a comment or even any ideas Maybe this could be a delayed drug reaction perhaps from the antibiotic course or this could be hives to something entirely different You will need to discuss this with your medical provider  someone who knows you the details of your care and someone that can examine you firsthand It depends on the percentage and amount of xylocaine and the reason it is being used At first the surgical insertion of the Ttube creates quite a bit of inflammation This can cause tinnitus or changes in your hearing Over time this is supposed to settle down and those symptoms should resolve It has not been a month since your surgery so things may still improve in the next month or so Tinnitus is not a pleasant symptom to tolerate I have it too and your hearing can actually be a bit more sensitive as you have demonstrated on your hearing test Of course this is of little consolation Your hearing loss may fluctuate so when you saw the ENT it may have been a good day If the tube was clogged your hearing would have been a bit muffled If you can wait it out a bit longer perhaps another month you may begin to experience gradual improvement or at least you will become more accustomed to those aberrant symptoms Either way it should get better for you Make sure to follow up with your ENT again if it does not I disagree that these symptoms are in your head Since your sister is the one treating you with her unfinished medication perhaps this question should be directed to her I am never of fan of this practice I think it is dangerous Since many illnesses are viral antibiotiics do absolutely nothing Apparently the medical provider at Urgent Care did not feel that you needed any antibiotic let alone a Sulfa drug or azithromycin The fact that a Zpack has worked for you in the past in no way implies that each year you have the same identical bacterial infection that responds to azithromycin Statistically this would be highly unlikely Illnesses do change over time Most people get better on their own but a few do get worse If you feel you are now sicker than when you were evaluated by Urgent Care than it would be better to be reevaluated again Perhaps you do need an antibiotic now but there is no way for me to make that determination over the Internet This would be the right thing to do Taking someone elses leftover antibiotic is not I cant tell you why since I have no way of examining you and I do not know your age or body weight body weight can be contributory do to a fat pad located around the penis Since you are worried and scared I would suggest that you get an appointment with a good urologist for a highlevel evaluation of this new event No medical professional could make an accurate assessmentdiagnosis based solely on a vague description Your son needs to have this lump carefully examined by a medical professional It could be many different thingsa sebaceous cyst a reactive postoccipital lymph nodeor  Please encourage him to do the right thing and have it properly examined and diagnosed Obviously without the ability to examine your son firsthand I would not be able to provide you with a definitive answer but if those little pimplelike bumps are firm and pearly and have a tiny belly button umbilication in the center you have to look very very close then they may be molluscum contagiosum  You can do an Internet or WebMD search for more information and some pictures Molluscum are very common viral wartlike skin lesions found in children I treat them with liquid nitrogen freeze them or use a chemical blistering agent called cantharidin Your son should first be properly diagnosed by his pediatrician or primary care medical provider It would not be wise to try and treat them over the counter until you have a definitive diagnosis If you are not having any problems this is not an emergency Emergency are lifethreatening events and a retained tampon is not in this category You can see your regular medical provider if you are having any vaginal symptoms like discharge or odor There can literally be HUNDREDS of types and causes of headaches It would be impossible to blindly make a patientspecific determination of the Internet You need to see a medical professional so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated  three things that cannot be accomplished online based solely a brief vague description This has been going on for FOUR DAYSand GETTING WORSE Please get off of the computer and seek medical care That punch may have ruptured your eardrum This is just a guess however since I cant examine you Most traumatic ruptures assuming this is what happened will heal in a few weeks and hearing will return to normal levels It is unfortunate that you have to wait for an appointmentyou really need to see an ENT now A medical provider would need to physically SEE your sons upper arm bumps in order to make an accurate diagnosis A vague description unfortunately doesnt do it With that said one possibility of many would be a common skin condition called keratosis pilaris  that actually runs in families You can do some research online and I am sure you will find plenty of information including some photos If this doesnt fit the bill he should see his health care provider or a dermatologist for a proper examination and diagnosis One possibility would be ringworm of the scalp Another possibility could be a small area of  Assuming you are not inadvertently pulling out patches of your hair by twisting or nervousness these are the two most common causes of patchy baldness In order to be properly diagnosed and treated you would need to see a medical provider or dermatologist for a careful examination She may have internal bleeding in the brain do not give her anything for it it can only cause the bleeding to get worse Get her to the doctor to get a ct scan as soon as possible My teenage son had a similar issue We first ruled out any bites bumps or allergic reactions Thanks to his hair cutter it was from wearing hats too often especially a plastic lined one that didnt allow his scalp to breath She suggested using Tea Tree Oil shampoo and Tea Tree  Lavender Conditioner It worked great Hope it does for you too I would go to the Dr ASAP especially if these syptoms have been prolonged there are many things that can cause these symptoms but only a Good Dr can diagnose You should get tested for Lyme Disease immediately There is not always a bullseye rash or visible tick You have nearly every symptom based on those experienced with having it Lyme Disease and other tick related coinfections are referred to as the great imitator because it brings on so many symptoms simultaneously that are consistent with so many other conditions They may want to test you for other things as well because of this especially as this has only been going on for a few days Personally I would specifically ask for an ELISA test and Western Blot to confirm  I am not a doctor just had lyme a few times If it is Lyme the sooner you are put on a protocol the better chance you have of not getting chronic Lyme Good Luck Hope you feel better soon The change of skin on any part of the body should be noted When itching comes and goes and color change should be looked at by a physician as there are a number of conditions that could be occuring Maybe a change in laundry detergents or body wash but any and all changes in skin color and itching needs to be addressed by a physician Of course wearing protection for yourself  others is advised yes go to the doctors as soon as possible better safe then sorry Very commonly men can develop problems in and around the foreskin and the penis called balinitis and thats just from chronic irritation It could be from a yeast infection It could be that it got dry it could be a hygiene issue The first thing you want to do is keep it clean and dry and try antifungal creams over the counter If it continues to be a problem then you probably should see a urologist who can assess and determine if theres something more serious it could always be penile cancer thats more rare but you want to make sure that theres nothing going on there then if it turns out that there is a problem chronic infections then you want to look at the options One of them is formal circumcision which is the last option Another one is called a dorsal slit where instead of removing the foreskin they simply cut through the scar that develops so that you can retract it easily and maintain your hygiene Sometimes its simply changing the medications or aggressive medication Sometimes lesions on the penis can be actually drug reactions that manifest themselves or allergic reactions So you should never assume that its just one thing you know if youve got a recurrent infection and jump right to a circumcision You want to know why youre getting the infection Maybe its the first warning sign of being diabetic These are all things that can play into it Thats again where a doctor can see the big picture and look at more than just whats obvious to try to figure out whats going on And then help you decide whats best for you because obviously you have to decide what you want for yourself the doctor is really there to help you and service and ideally provide you the pros and cons of the options so you can choose intelligently and decide whats best Yes you should have it checked but sometimes it seems as though they have closed but have not I thought that with my son as well but the doctor found that they were actually still soft and open was wanting my answer from an MD expert You should go back to your doctor because there are quite a number of reasons why your symptoms may have not be alleviated such as the cause of your sinus infection may have not been bacterial rather viral therefore antibiotics were futile to the infection and so on NOHARD well it i used to Masturbate every night for about 23 weeks then shortly after i was doing it in the morning too Do you have a history of ulcers Sounds like classic ulcerative conditions You should try not drinking coffee or smoking both of which can aggravate the pain You may also need to see a gastric specialist Adult acne may be attributed to hormonal changes The most important thing is to wash your face twice a day with a gentle soap There is no need to wash your face more than twice a day unless you are sweating profusely or have a very dirty job Salicylic acid is found in a number of acne products and this works to dissolve the sebaceous oils helping to remove any skin debris that is clogging your pores Rinse this off Find a very mild benzoyl peroxide cream something that is 25 or less This is applied directly to the skin at night to help unclog you pores as you sleep Try this every other night at first Adult acne and whiteheads are very common It could be caused by anything including a hormonal imbalance makeup a new moisturizer or the sunscreen youre using Try backing off of any new additions to your skin program and trying oil free makeup and skin care Whiteheads occur when your pores accumulate excess oil or sebum and fail to drain Frequently acneforming bacteria will arise simultaneously due to pore blockage and the alteration of the pH on the surface of your skin In order to combat this you will need to begin exfoliating your skin and reduce surface bacteria on your skin with compounds containing alphahydroxy acids AHAs or salicylic acid You may be suffering from melasma a skin condition characterized by hyperpigmentation of the cheeks and forehead Some melasma sufferers will exhibit refractory hyperpigmentation after topical regimens You may want to consider further evaluation with a physician who is experienced in laser treatments for refractory melasma specifically for your skin type This sounds like a complex problem Your current treatment regimen sounds appropriate One issue that may be getting overlooked is your overall hormonal status Changes in your hormones may contribute to adult acne Your physician should evaluate your hormone levels and functioning Your first step is to evaluate your current skincare regimen Harsh soaps detergents or products with high alcohol content will irritate the skin which may lead to further oil production You should use gentle cleansers and exfoliate weekly with compounds that contain salicylic acid and are noncomedogenic Along with your exfoliating regimen your physician can recommend skinbrightening compounds that will work in conjunction with salicylic acid which will even out your skin tone Sun damage and smoking are the No 1 reasons for premature aging or wrinkling of the skin Therefore you should incorporate the use of sunblock in your daily skincare regimen Next utilize a daily skin regimen that exfoliates your skin which will help remove dead skin cells This should be followed by a noncomedogenic moisturizer that contains vitamins C  E and rebuilds peptides for your skin He doesnt have a head injury it was more for a bump than a hit Try using mineral oil You may have impacted ear wax like my fiance You may need to go to your doctor and have your ears flushed out They will remove all of the built up wax and clean out any residue that may be left Im no Doctor but his father has had to do this multiple times but he never has any problems with it Hope this helps yes Maybe it could be from your hair being pulled in that particular spot if you have a pony that is always in that place and if you use hair spray on a regualr bases and you use it on that spot where your pony tail is Yes also it can break your pelvis and cause skin cancer on your Penis R Sounds like a venous anomalya slightly larger than usual vein that shows up on MRI scan Its usually nothing to worry about There is a type of headache called occipital neuralgia that is just in the back of the head usually with severe tenderness in the back of the head Most patients with occipital neuralgia have increased pain with movement There is often a burning quality to the pain and some patients have a pins and needles sensation with the pain There is a fairly simple treatment for occipital neuralgiainjection of a local anesthetic lidocaine or novacaine into the nerve in the scalp which numbs up the back of the head and makes the pain go away Sometimes taking a medication like Aleve or Motrin every day for several days will calm this down Several things could be causing thissometimes the head position when you are on the MRI scan table puts stress on the neck causing neck pain patients have complained to me about this There are 2 nerves in the back of the head called the Greater Occipital Nerves These nerves can be compressed when your head is laying on a hard surface and cause fairly severe pain as well There are not any serious problems inside the head like brain problems that would cause this The magnetic field from the MRI scan is not strong enough to directly influence the brain or pain fibers You may have a pinched nerve from a disc problem first clean out your tub rince of any strong cleaner from your tub fill it with warm water and backing soda soak for 20 mins make you have an over the counter yeast cream the best would be medication for athletes foot it docent mater

like Balmex for the irritation well i thought this was a place where people could get some answers but apparently not I would have to say blood pressure increase or drop GO TO THE ER I had the Mirena in for the full 5 years and I remember having the spotting which happened for a while But you are mentioning that the spotting is heavier and having small clots I think it would be wise and to just put your mind at rest that what you are experiencing is normal or needs to be looked at because of this I would suggest you call your Drs office and explain whats happening and they should get back to you either way to put your mind at rest no I dont see any appropriate answer to this question besides keeping a close eye on the person mean while taking them to the ER They can be VERY serious and should be taken that way to avoid complications that could have been avoided keep them awake Welcome First have you spoken to your parents about any of this If not thats your very first

scabies may be detected during a physical exam Blood may be drawn to test for hepatitis herpes HIV or syphilis Urine samples can be used to test for gonorrhea chlamydia or HIV Samples of discharge can be used to test for herpes gonorrhea chlamydia trichomonas or syphilis Tissue can be tested for chlamydia gonorrhea or scabies Saliva can be used to test for HIV antibodies Health care providers dont automatically test for sexually transmitted infections  you should ask to be tested Be honest with your provider about your sexual history and what risks youve taken and the two of you can decide which tests are appropriate You might want to try a lubricant and make sure you are wearing a condom I have migraines but have not experienced this However I have heard about this from other people I know this doesnt help but I think you should go to the doctor Its my understanding that this is basically an infection You might be able to save money by not having the tooth capped but its my understanding that you need to get the infection addressed Sure does  there are actually 4 types of prostatitis I am SO sorrybut I could not resist saying this I have NO idea how old you are or

many other people do too Ive read you can trace your lineage to a certain region of the world if you have that bump And the old wives tale of bigger the bump smarter the person lol I did go to the ER back when this happened The doctor said I had a concussion That it needed stitches of some sort but since I was in travel between countries when it happened and there was a 24 hour delay in getting to a hospital that he didnt want to agitate it more and wanted to let it heal on its own Basically I went and it hurt really bad and was bleeding lots In the midst of the concussion I completely blacked out and could not see I vomitted etc all the things you dont want to happen I told the doctor all of this He basically gave me some brochures on concussions and how to deal with the symptomspain and sent me on my way But yes I did go to ER I did go to the ER back when this happened The doctor said I had a concussion That it needed stitches of some sort but since I was in travel between countries

psychiatrist My son started having hallucinations 2 yrs ago His hallucinations we found out were caused by anxiety Hallucinations can also be caused by depression among other things Talk to a therapist or a psychiatrist than can assist you with your hallucinations Externally there are topical line relaxers the most effective target just the line you want to treat The line fillers are meant to fill in your lines but dont seem to work too well for me I think regular consistent care of the skin is the most important thing you can do Routinely moisturize your skin twice a day face and neck Shower and then follow with a good thick moisturizer that has vitamins C E A with hyaluronic acid and sunscreen Avoid products with alcohol as an ingredient as this will dry and damage new skin Clean skin at night and use a good night cream Personally I love the Olay Refinishing Night Cream makes skin so soft and smells great Internally drink water and eat your berries  veggies Take a B Vitamin complex with Biotin fish oil and a multivitamin If your lines dont respond to a line relaxer and twice daily TLC a precription for Retinol may do the trick I personally find these creams effective Strivectin Lift cream really lifts The newest Neutrogena Tone improving moisturizer is a nice effective cream that brightens skin well The Olay refinishing line helps with surface problems such as large pores I also use Vitamin E oil and Collagenabsorbed through skin about once a week after a shower on wet skin Allover Then of course theres always Botox  When your Dr orders an MRI and you have it done It is seen by a professional and the results are sent back to your Dr I find it weird that you were told there was something of concern on your MRI And at the same time told it was nothing to worry about I would go to the place where you had your MRI And ask for a copy of the results And take it with you and get a second opinion can some one help me Check with your ENT could be something to do with the sinus My 14 yr old daughter has the same thing  definitely shingles on her head where she had a total of 2 chicken pox as a 6 mos old the blisters are in clusters down the back of the left side of her head When you get to her body though she has the dew drop single chicken pox looking blisters It is as if she got shingles where she had the 2 original pox but has chicken pox on the rest of her body  both sides of torso effected front and back right side of face singly splattered NO pox at all though on the right side of her head SHE IS IN PAIN TOO Ventral Hernia i have the same thing an i done some research and i am pretty sure it is a Ventral Hernia but i will no very soon for a have made an appointment for my family doctor and i will post the results on here for you good luck to you and i hope its fixable i read about it and with surgery it can be fixed but dont leave it too long ok cheers and talk to you soon with real answers My dr had told me it is normal to feel like that and symptoms of strep is swollen neck and lymph nodes I know i felt like i got hit by a truck for two days I woundnt be to worried but just to be sure see a doctor Do you have small lesions near or in your private area They start out small and will be red then grow a little larger and have a white pimple like top The first outbreak is usually the most uncomfortable and actually hurts burns and itches Subsequent breakouts will not be as painful as the initial breakout seems to be a sinus infection maybe contact doctor about it if it persists I do that all the timeeven in bed GO SEE A CHIROPRACTOR I wouldnt want to live without one since I started seeing one Usually a quick adjustment to the neck is all it takes Also ice packs to the area help with the pain you probably have an astigmatiziam which is weak eye muscles I had those several years ago My doctor at the time called them WINS She said they were a small tumor like under skin on my head She removed them in the doctor office small incision popped them out and tied my hair together with string instead of stitches I wouldnt pop them out myself should let the doctor do it for sure Hope this helps If any teenager has this leading trait of hair loss in the family then it can almost be made certain that its hereditary and that pretty soon the condition could only worsen The first step is to consult a doctor particularly a hair restoration specialist to see what can be done For this you can refer to Dr Coles forhaircom and as the patient is still a minor a parent or guardian must be present to assume legal responsibility It is possible you may have allergies to both indoor and outdoor triggers In door triggers include pet dander dust certain cleaners Outdoor allergies can come in a wide variety pollen is a big one Both pollen and dust can effect your sinuses creating headaches Even if you have never had allergies in the past that does not mean you will never have them Some people dont realize they have them till they become severe They most likely are Milias This is a type of whitehead you have to get them removed by a dermatologist I get them everyday and my Dr uses a Hydracator medical equipment to remove them He uses a needle and sort of touches them zap and they will turn red and heal in 4 7 days Gook luck No shampoo cant cause red bumps it has to be dryskin i used to get these type of tension headaches all the time there is a ringing in the ear also for me my doctor ordered a catscan and all they found was i hadhave chronic sinusitis what helps alleviate me when i get these is i sit straight up and stretch my neck muscles slowly bend your head from side to side pulling your neck and upper back muscles while pushingpulling down on your shoulders at the same timedo only to the extent that you can of course i start my days with these stretches and i make sure to drink alot of waterhope this helps you This also happens to my girlfriend the doctor told her she needed more iron in her blood this worked but whenever she stopped taking iron pills she got dizzy and had headaches again so probably a good diet with lots of iron Bipolar is not connected to blood vessels aneurysmIT is nervous system disorderConsult a neurologistHeadache is just symptomThere are so many diseases causing headacheYou must go to cause of headacheSo consult family doctor to check up blood pressurevision etc I swear Ive told my fiance mom that even my darned toes to my hair sweat Sheesh AM I glad you know what I mean that I am not the ONLY 1 I am 55 KNOW that I am in menopause which also means MENNOPAWS so I guess you know how MY sig other feels lol I am not going to take hormones I moan n gripe too much already all comedy aside it isnt funny at ALL I either have windows open  fans a flyin OR am wrapped in sweaters bathrobes  blankets wake up to a wet cold bed do house work sweat like a banshee  WOW I can barely stand MYSELF If I showered 3x a day I still think that the odor would be there I sit here n play a game get hotter than a mink then colder than a fridge Ask the ole man hes been patiently waiting Ive seriously thought about bringing him SOMEwhere like to a cousin or the like Sex is the LAST thing I wantneedcare for  honestly I used to love it Anyhow I have heard that diabetic types of conditions can be a cause Also which floored me COPD Our bodies are always changing along wmetabolism  mine just isnt there any longer Dont count out the hot flashes there are all typesso Ive heard Excuse the jabs up there I am my own worst enemy It is possible that this is just a temporary sideeffect as your body adjusts to the new drug I would probably take a few more doses and go from there I recently started Zoloft for anxiety along with my Klonopin which I have been on for 2 years and I have had no side effects after 5 days None of the typical gastrointestinal nausea etc However Cymbalta is an SNRI and Zoloft is an SSRI I am not sure but I do believe that SNRIs can come with more side effects You may want to ask your doctor why an SNRI was chosen I think you should see a psychiatrist about this I have had a similar problem when I was younger that sort of fizzled out Anxiety disorders like OCD fall on a spectrum and can be difficult to diagnose Anxiety can be a HUGE factor in ones ability to listen and focus That constant inner dialogue can be very distracting In your case it sounds like you obsess over repeating the words being spoken aloud in your own head When I was a child I would often mouth or whisper under my breath what I had just said It was an obsession over checking how it sounded and if I said it correctly You may not have clinical OCD but anxiety can manifest itself in compulsions and obsessions Also consider why you changed from Lexapro Lexapro is generally considered to be more effective in treating anxiety than Celexa I know someone who had success with Lexapro but the sexual side effects were too pronounced They switched to Zoloft and had the same success and a decrease in sexual dysfunction It could be a sinus infection if you have a high temperature green thick or smelly nasal discharge you should see you doctor for antibioctics as it may be a bacterial infaction If you are feeling confused you should see your doctor as soon as possible to rule out any complications Otherwise it could be a viral infection in which case take ibruprofen drink lots of fluids and monitor your temperature and again see your doctor in two weeks if it is not any better Allergies can also cause such problems so again monitor your condition and if your symptoms are not inproving after twothree weeks see your doctor How old is he I ask because due to certain genes a wide range of heights are common at certain ages even among siblings Im not a DR but when I had a severe pain behind my right ear and went to the er they said I had Bells Palsy I also had right side paralisis on my face I would suggest a Dr visit

speculate what has happened Good Luck and please be grateful that you have had your mitral valve replaced Apple cider vinegar would be the best out of all vinegars due to the acidic levels which will kill off dead cells causing the skin to make new healthy cells by applying to sunburn for one minute via cotton ball With this being said it will significantly dry out your childs skin and would absolutely need aloe vera as a follow up If you can find a brand that contains vitamin e or c together that is a bonus otherwise get vitamin e lotion as well for a healthy moisturizer Hope this helps It can be caused by many things I had vertigo from a medication I was on once The ER doctor asked me if the room felt like it was spinning or did I feel like I was spinning He explained that usually if the cause is from the neck up inner ear ear infection etc you will feel like the room is spinning and if the cause is from the below the neck such as cardiac issues you feel like youre spinning Some of your symptoms are also those of diabetes If the room is spinning you can take Meclizine OTC check with a pharmacist if you are taking other medications If the problem is inner ear or an ear infection this should help your symptoms If it doesnt help or your symptoms get worse you should probably see a doctor to rule out more serious conditions On one side of the head this can be symptoms of TIA stroke brain tumor multiple sclerosis and other serious neurological conditions You need to see a doctor immediately to rule out any serious conditions If you are having ministrokes or TIAs you need to have treatment to prevent a stroke which can cause permanent damage are they tags or black heads more info is needed but with tags i would not advise to get them removed if they are black

diet issues that causes my headachs maybe read some books about headachs and migraine to see if you can find symptoms on what you are experiencing and see what you can do about it yourself but it

them awake for at least an hour But if youre worried take him in Better safe than sorry something ive learned about having panic attacks is they cant and will not kill or hurt you But that aside what I do to stop my panic attacks is this and doing this can stop them just as quick as it comes When you feel your panic attack coming tell your self out loud or scream it in your mind that I am fine I am ok stop stop stop stop go away And repeat it over and over till it goes away By telling your brain to stop it breaks the panic signal and replaces it with the stop signal Try it it works for me

promise my screen name is joker and there is a lot of ppl on there that can help you with anxiety You can come in as a guest or make a name My son went through this same thing when he was younger the doctor ran all sorts of tests and did the IV antibiotics and no change If your daughter is sleeping a lot along with the other symptoms have her doctor check for mono disease This is what my son was diagnosed with and it took a month and a half after diagnoses for it to go away Also try the mixture of ibuprofen and Tylenol together for the fever I hope she feels better soon Good luck You should still go and see your Docter  So they are aware of this  It can also be stress related  My son in law  he had some kind of fit Doctors cannot get to bottom of why  you need to take her to the hospital immediately and dont let her fall asleep keep her up until a doctor is able to see her I think you need to see a doctor after 3 weeks of vomiting This sounds like more then the flu or gastroenteritis Could you possibly be pregnant I suggest seeing your doctor or going to the ER where they can run tests Good Luck and hope you feel better soon I had the same problem and had nerve conduction study done and had a full study by my cardiologist Findings were negative Im wondering if it might be caused by my teeth What is the source of your neck pain If it is your muscle around your neck you can massagestretches to it and apply heat If it is your bone you should see a chiropractor Concussion and head trauma are used interchangeably Usually in sports concussion is described when someone is knocked out and doesnt have relocation of what happened Regardless they are both trauma to the head and have same symptom You need rest and monitor any changes that has happened I know of someone who sustained head trauma and never had it checked he was found dead five weeks later and after the autopsy the first question the Dr asked the family was had he suffered a recent head trauma Your situation is different in that the time period has been much longer but in general head trauma should always be evaluated Disequilibrium is the loss of balance or the feeling of unsteadiness when you walk Causes may include Inner ear vestibular problems Abnormalities with your inner ear can cause you to feel like you are unsteady while walking especially in the dark Sensory disorders Failing vision and nerve damage in your legs peripheral neuropathy are common in older adults and may result in difficulty maintaining your balance Joint and muscle problems Muscle weakness and osteoarthritis  the type of arthritis that involves wear and tear of your joints  can contribute to loss of balance when it involves your weightbearing joints Neurological conditions Various neurological disorders can lead to progressive loss of balance such as Parkinsons disease cerebellar ataxia and an acoustic neuroma Medications Loss of balance can be a side effect of certain medications such as antiseizure drugs sedatives and tranquilizers To ensure that you have one of these conditions you should have an eye movement test to show if you can track a moving objectposturography test to show which parts of the balance system you rely on most and which parts are causing problems and a rotary chair test Before you can do one of these tests you will need to visit a neurologist This condition seems so serious it may be a seizure you should visit an emergency department as quick as possible Seek treatment as fast as you can My husband has a small cut on his penis He claims he doesnt know how it got there Is it possible for a man to cut himself there and not know how You may advise your boyfriend to see a board certified dermatologist about that particular concern or he may check out wwwclearcliniccom Hi It sounds like your accident was quite traumatic and your symptoms may be due to stored emotional and or physiological sensations from the accident Look at Traumasomacom Dr Scaer is an expert on Trauma and his information may give you some insight and direction for treatment Peter Levine is also a top expert in this area Plenty of videos on YouTube also Good luck this is a case cevical spondylitis which mean iflamation of the cervical spine More like a mole or wart trying to start maybe stress related also I think you are suffering from concussionbetter get it checked out ASAP go to your doctor get nine one one on the phone right away That is probably not a brain seizure and is probably related to the ADHD If youre concerned make an appointment with your health care provider and talk to himher about your fears Are you being treated for the ADHD symptoms Sometimes symptoms can get worse or new symptoms can pop up without regular treatment My advice would be to speak with a physician Contact your Physician who prescribed your latest antibiotic Ask them If it is not ok they will either send in some refills or ask you to come back in for further exams you can live a healthier life panic disorder see a psycologist seems something is differentcontact his dr ummmmmmm see a dr first While Im not a doctor and Ive barely started taking medical related classes the immediate thing that comes to mind is that you are pinching a nerve or that it is at the very least nerve related To solve this issue you can ice or heat whatever feels the best for you stop putting your head back and get some extra sleep If this continues for longer than 3 days with no improvement you need to go see a doctor If this comes with any other symptoms such as pain you NEED to see a doctor sooner than a few days Good luck many things can cause headache cluster headaches neuralgias  migraines I strongly advise you see a physician to have this checked out If youre sensitive to light andor sound and the pain is usually on the same side it could be a migraine Nausea and aura weirdness in your vision can happen too Regular painkillers wont help as this headache is caused at least in part by a serotonin imbalance in the brain Ive had luck with ice packs caffeine and quiet rest in a dark room The only thing that has really helped is Imitrex but that has worked for over 20 years I have personally had anxiety attacks before They definitely feel physical the way you described And when I had one I was so scared and nervous that it caused my heartbeat to go racing like that The feeling of being trapped is exactly what an anxiety attack feels like When I got mine I always felt I had to leave whatever building I was in to get fresh air My therapist recommended that I not try to give in to my feelings of needing escape because that would only feed my anxiety and cause it to build He recommended exercise to help ease the stress and tension in my life A good outlet for anxiety shine splints is a contubustion of alot of things not wearing the proper foot wear for the activity your in Was the migraine any worse that other migrianes you have had If not did you take any abortive medications such as Imitrex If you take Imitrex or other triptans for more than two days you can get rebound headache The same happens with Tylenol and Ibupropin Migraines can last for several days Also some people have them every day If you havent been to a neurologist migraine specialist I would see one to work on a better treatment plan To play it safe since you have pain at the base of the headspine do you have a fever Also can you tilt your head towards your chest without pain It could be a bacterial or viral meningitis It is not likely but you may want to see your physician for this Marieh9 Tension headachesmigraines and if they are bad enough they could cause nausea and vomiting and sensitivity to light Migraines can be one sided Massage therapist or chiropractic visits are helpful Putting ice packs to the back of the neck is also helpful I find sitting up in my recliner in a dark room is more helpful than lying down Just wanted to add That I have seen my doctor yesterday I didnt think to ask him whether I should be off of work He did mention that this may take a week to recover from My pregnancy test came back negative as well have you been checked for pleurisy It might be causing the pain in your chest I had pain in my left upper side took them forever to figure it out but meds made it all better exact same symptoms mine went on for years before it was properly diagnosed Dont know I am having the exact same problem Did you end up seeing a doctor or getting better ear nose and throat Vertigo is usually caused by to much fluid in the inner ear This sounds like strep throat Could be your marbles are out of whack they are right behind your ears Try standing in one spot stare stare at something in front of you Now shake your head back n foth hope this helps It did me You have to take meds for at least 5 days before they are in your system for you to see any change is it new pain  have you had it for a long time have ever took xrays of your neck do you have dissiness any pain during sleep  is it worse in the when you wake up or during the day or while sleep  yes i myself was told i had adhd or rather when i was a kid it was only add and i remember doing alot of things like that when i was young i feel the worst time in a kid with adhds life is the teen years based on my own experence i dont really know what you can do to help him personally  no one was really able to help me i kinda had to wake up out of it myself and even now i still have some adhd tendencies like ocd and failing to complete tasks for ex ill clean everything in my house but leave one thing undone is does change as you get older im not as bad as i was before i threw things broke my hand punching my stap father in the face  when to a mental hospital so yeah things can get pretty bad when a child with adhd  best thing you can do is try to understand him and hope hell try to speak with u or his father when hes acting out dont pay him any mind hes gonna get over it but if it gets worse you may have to bring him to the doctor to talk about what can be done  i rememebr i had someone to speak to one a week for 14 years it really helped me  im now a mother to a 4 year old with the same problem so i hope this helped or at least gave you an idea of what direction to go in good luck well some people get nose bleeds alot do you get them once in a while  i dont think the dayqull would have anything to do with it  your nose could have been bleeding due to dryness in your nose or sinus  as for it happeing again could have been to the fact when we cry to put a lot of blood pressure up into our heads and it could have triggard it  i think its nothing to worry about everyone is different i broke my nose when i was young it didnt bleed  n ive never had a nose bleed in my life but thats just me  i have a friend who gets one everytime he get mad or starts crying blood just starts running out but if it doesnt stop or gets worse within a week go to the doctor  hope u feel better dont know but if its giving him pain i would go see the doctor about it  may first make a call to the doctor he may tell you a few things that can help make it go away  has he had it long is he 100 sure that he wasent hit on the head  you know boys will be boys  i think only if he has pain is it really something to worry about  hope this helps i have had trouble with my shoulder for many years after 8 years which was way to long i had lost all movement it was like having a dead arm  i also had poppingmy advice is go to the doctor have them do an xray seeing what you did its likely then will recommend some excersies for you to do  dont try to move your arm move then it will go without pain cause if you let this go and done take care of it  it can get really bad i had to have reconstruction surgery and my arm will never be the same theres alot things i cant do now that i may have been able to if i would have taken care of it from the start you dislocated your should is what it sounds like  i myself have had that happen many times  it is also possible that all the pain your still have cause its normal to have pain for a while but when the pain begina to move through out your back and arm its possible it didnt go back in correctly  i would go to see the doctor dont let it go untreated i left my shoulder untreated for 8 years long story short in the end i had a dead arm couldnt use it and had to have reconstruction surgery believe me it wasent fun and ill never have the same movement again im sure the doctor will gove you something for the pain do an xray possible mri if he feels its bad enough and have you do some pt phyical therapy hope this helps also try not to move your arm to much untill you know what going on  and dont try to move it in a area that causes more pain sounds to me like you might have shingles check it out pronto maybe laydown for a few hours and see if that helps The lump sounds like an abscess I would definitely consult my primary physician about treatment options It could have lead to an infection and can potentially lead to other health related issues Its time to go back to the doctor It is possible that the antibiotic you were given was not strong enough or you werent on it long enough It could even be that you need a different antibiotic Go to the doctor before it gets worse Steriod cream is probably going to be your best bet Look up common childhood skin problem here on WebMD you may find a picture that you can relate to Hope it goes away quickly it doesnt sound too serious it sounds like an ear infectionmy glands swell when i get ear infections it may not have happened to u before but u need to remember that it is all connected I used to get headaches in my sleep too First its helpful if you are not dehydrated or still digesting food at 11 pm and beyond because your serotonin is produced then if you dont have food allergies and sensitivities biofeedback is a great way to get a full panel then I might recommend finding a upper cervical chiropractor NUCCCA is their title so you can look them up that way I feel great when I wake up now Hope that helps I get the exact same thing when my neck is out of whack I have always been under chiropractic care but none really helped until I found an upper cervical specialist The abbreviation for their special training is NUCCA you can look them up that way It really changed my life I went from a reverse curve in my neck to almost normal Hope that helps first i am not a dr but I occasionally have that problem as well when i mentioned it to my pcp he said that it is mostly a blood vessel he did ask me if there were any forms of heart problems in my family he then sent me for some tests which i never follow through on if it sounds like a heartbeat odds are it is a blood vessel that is close to your ear if you have a family history of heart problems see a cardiovascular physcian Taking him to the ER might be a good idea My brother played football and never reacted like that after a badhard tackle if you dont want to go to the ER at least consider a walk in clinic My 12 year old had a rash that sounds like yours for a year So I wondered if you take any over the counter acid controller meds or prescribed Like Zantac Pepcid or something like that That was what was causing my sons rash and when I stopped those pills his rash went awayIt took a few weeks for it to totally disappear but within a few days it started looking better Before that I had tried everything like you did Dermatologists creams steroids 2 shots in the butt antibiotics tons of over the counter lotions and creams Drove myself crazy trying too help him I also tried hypoallergenic laundry soap hypoallergenic fabric softener unscented bath soap and used cotton sheets just to name a few Have you thought about anything you may have changed in your routine Like different soap new clothes new pet anything like that Maybe you could try to go back to what changed a month ago when it started Thats how I figured out what caused my sons rash The docs told us it was eczema But they never tried to figure out what caused it I had to do that It may take a while to figure out but I think something you changed in your routine started your itching I hope you find your answer And let me know if I can help As Elizabeth suggested there is no link between ear wax and sinuses I think a health care provider would be a real solution of the issues you are suffering from You can also get a guide from your family doctor as he would be well aware of your health care history and suggest you with process ahead If you have not seen your doctor yet particularly one that is trained in concussions as most primary care physicians are not you need to right away A concussion is swelling of the brain Getting a 2nd concussion when still symptomatic from the first concussion is incredibly dangerous and can lead to very severe consequences such as permanent brain damage I cannot stress enough the importance of going to your doctor RIGHT AWAY Depends on the severity but head trauma by definition should be checked by a licensed doctor may need to see Chiropractor mine does at times and one day Ill deep breath and pops on its on my advise would be go to the er if it doesnt get better because these can be signs of a stroke or something else I agree that the dermatologist is mostly your best bet if you have tried everything else They will give you exctly the medicine you need And also keep from picking at your white heads and zits if you are When you mess with them and pick at them then thats what usually causes scarring as well Im not a doctor but I am having the same problem I went to my doctor and even tho both ears look great I have fluid behind my ear I dont necessarily know where but they told me there is fluid in my ear but my ears looked good I was told to use Afrin and also an allergy medication with a decongestant in it Ive been doing this for 3 days and I only notice a slight difference but my right ear is plugged It cracks when I drink and yawn and cough but they also told me to chew gum I hope this helps Good luck Sounds like dehydration Are you drinking enough water when you run You need to make sure that you increase your intake of water when you work out You sweat out a lot of your fluids when you work out so they need to be replenished Also dont work out on a completely empty stomach It will make your blood sugar decrease which could also make you dizzy when you work out Even tho you dont have any sinus problems most headaches are sinus related Best thing to do is try to lay down and relax quietly untill the pain passes Over straining or even continuing with normal activites will mostly make the pain prolonged Our body is like a computer garbage in garbage out I highly recommend that you look at your diet Are you eating a lot of processed foods There is not much nutrition in processed foods if any In my opinion even organic processed food is garbage Once something has been processed it is dead food Are you eating fresh fruits and vegetables preferably organic so your immune system can heal your skin and does not have to fight all the chemicals in conventional foods Raw unprocessed nuts Eggs yes they are really good for you Stay away from conventional meats and dairy It is truly true you are what you eat Make it an adventure to discover real food not stuff that comes from a box You will see your skin become as it should be at your age luminous and supple Granted it takes a little effort but once you see the results in your skin and you will you gladly eat at home and make it a home cooked meal Highly recommend you study up on healthy nutrition maybe take a cooking course I am 64 and almost wrinkle free my weight is normal and I can pass for 50 That is what good nutrition can do for you My husband had this some time agowe were sent to a physical therapist trained in a method from the Mayo Clinic It is based on the fact that as people age they often have tiny particles in the inner ear move out and cause the vertigo There is a technique they use of manipulating the head to place them back where they belong It did the trick for my husband Sounds silly but it isnt Ive also been told the directions for doing this may be found online Check out Mayo Clinicwe did have a handout from there showing how it is done Good luck Yes If you think so go to the doctor I have had a similar problem What could be happening is sudden drops in your blood pressure There are several very dangerous conditions that could be causing thisCall your doctor immediately and if he cant get you in right away  GO TO THE HOSPITAL try using more pillows to elevate your head so you do not have to resort to sleeping in recliner I am no doctor but I recently got a concussion I am 15 years old so we are most likely similar in age Let me tell you about my concussion I got hit in the head with a giant flag during marching band and it did hurt very bad I kept playing though until the show was done After that I immediately knew something was wrong because all of a sudden it was hard to walk and I had a big headache and I went to find my parents I couldnt walk straight and it was very difficult but we went to the ER and They did tests on me I followed the doctors hand and it was hard I had to touch certain places that the doctors moved his hand to and that was extremely difficult I was diagnosed with a concussion Now you may have one too I suggest getting checked out by a doctor but that is just my experience with a concussion Virtigo maybe or low blood sugar 2448 hours depends on whats wrong I would talk to your Dr maybe something else going on Do you have high blood presure If so call you Dr asap Absolutely take him to a doctor It may be nothing but it may be a life threatening condition My 14 year old daughter had similar to what symptoms you describe and it was lymphoma Doctor first insisted it is just strep throat and with this it is common for all lymph nodes in body to swell and to have elevated temp Gave her antibiotics I kept calling doctor and nurse telling them it is getting worse and was told each time to wait that it will get better Several days later she could barely walk due to sever swelling and pain and I took her in demanding she be seen They found it to be cancer Dont wait Use common sense and listen to mothers intuition if what doctor tells you does not seem right Take him to the ER if you cant get in to doctors office because of lack of insurance Insist he be seen The samething happens to me it could be GERD as far as nausea but i still havent figured out why the headaches I had the same problem and i visited the doctor and found out the my cholesterol and triglycerides were high and my thyroid gland was slow but after i started medication stain was gone no defrise one costs more and is beter qualady could be allergic reaction to a med no as long as they are not red around the area and not itching you should be safe I think you should get it checked or take a picture of it to see if it changes you should have saved the tick also watch for a bullseye shape mark that would be bad I understand there are many reasons Why you may not want to see a Doctor that is your choice I am gay and have anal sex I got an anal wart on the shaft of my penis once by not using a condom I used Compound W to remove it Mind you this will burn and hurt and it will take a few applications but it should remove your Tag Try to keep the Compound W only on the tag and not cover a large area Again and fair warning this is going to burn and hurt Hair loss or baldness may or may not related to your family background and this may be due to many reasons like hormonal changesserious illness scalp infection and mental stress etc Just check out if you had gone through any operations or serious illness It is better to use natural products which may be a remedy for hair loss and itching also If you have interest on the natural products better to choose products made of Argan nuts which are especially found in Moroccan Atlas Mountains The oils acidity and vitamins are essential for hair and assist in softening nourishing and rehabilitating the hair You can also find this nuts used for making of shampoo and conditioner which may give better result if three products used in an exact way I cant say definitely but a suggestion can be given because I am also a former acne sufferer tried many products for my face and got frustrated with all those Then my friend suggested me about an e book which is designed with only holistic methods to cure acne permanently I downloaded the Acnenomore ebook from httpwwwacnenomorecom at a very reasonable price It cures acne Without Resorting To Drugs Without Creams Or Ointments Works on All Types of Acne Vulgaris Conglobata Rosacea Blackheads Whiteheads and Cysts Proven to Work On Teen or Adult Acne Acne on The Face Back Shoulders Neck Or Chest Even If You Have Very Severe Acne Faster Than You Ever Thought PossibleYou

Suffering From Low Self Esteem Depression Worry and Anxiety Because Of Your Acne Avoid Going Out Often Because Of Your Acne Feel Obsessed Over Your Acne Condition Spend A Lot of Money On Drugs and

starter kit and get Elinquid or Ecartridge so you can smoke for a long time and save a lot of money yes go to the dr to remove prevent further infection  About 2010 I got a concussion when I fell while I was a patient in the hospital strangely enough I did not at that time have vestibular issues But I do now Its very frustrating when youre doing the PT for vestibular and still have the symptoms  I passed out without any warning Stood up and 30 seconds later passed out again Both times I landed on my face But I was unconscience before I even hit the floor Doctors were thinking it likely was seizures The last time I had a seizure was approx 1985 But I have been taking my medicine to prevent them for many years Could it be possible that switching to a newer drug Antivert may be to blame I dont know why my neurologist made me switch After all if it aint broke dont fix it According to him Dilantin is a very old medicine I have gone back to taking Dilantin But I am getting therapy for vestibular as a result of the episodes BTW is there a difference between dizzy and lightheaded  Hot flashes I a 48 yearold man get them I dont know if mine are caused by all of the bipolar meds that I take  That happened to me when I was hit by a truck while riding my bicycle back to work in the rain I couldnt feel my legs or the pain until the paramedics lifted me up off the pavement I
