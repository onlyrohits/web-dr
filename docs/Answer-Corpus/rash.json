{"text": "it might be more than strep if you have had it more than 7 days after you started meds I would go get tested for mono It could be the lotion Even though its meant to moisturize an inexpensive lotion can contain alcohol and other drying chemicals and some of these substances can cause dermatitis or allergic reactions Keep in mind too that a lotion is actually meant to be absorbed so it doesnt really do the trick as a lube Youre better off using a waterbased personal lubricant meant for the purpose and you can follow up when youre done by washing and then applying a penis health creme health professionals recommend Man1 Man Oil to soothe moisturize and rejuvenate the skin I was on Chantix and I did not have all these symptoms but I did get sick to my stomach and had horrible nightmares and bad mood swings I quite on day 8 of taking it and have been clean for two years I learned that drinking milk before I went to bed would make the nightmares go away and it also helped me with the stomach pains through out the day as for the mood swings I warned people to stay away A persistent rash needs to be evaluated by your general doctor or a dermatologist a skin doctor Hives urticaria are red itchy raised areas of the skin that can range in size and appear anywhere on your body The cause of the hives can be drugs foods stress and is unknown in many cases The fact that the rash appears anywhere on your body suggests this diagnosis Hives are an allergic reaction and those with asthma and allergies are more prone If the cause of your hives can be identified you should avoid that trigger Some drugs and foods take days to leave the body so your doctor may prescribe antihistamines in the meantime to relieve your symptoms Contact dermatitis is another possible explanation for your rash This rash occurs when certain substances come into contact with your skin Contact dermatitis causes a localized rash on the skin which may be red sore itchy and have bumps or blisters There are two kinds of contact dermatitis irritant or allergic Irritant contact dermatitis is more often painful than itchy and is caused by a substance damaging the part of your skin where it comes into contact Contact with acids soaps detergents fabric softeners or other chemicals may cause irritant contact dermatitis The reaction often occurs on the hands and is frequently workrelated Allergic contact dermatitis is caused by exposure to a substance or material to which you have become extra sensitive or allergic Common causes include fabrics clothing soaps and nail polish Rubber gloves are one of the most frequent causes of occupational allergic contact dermatitis especially in health care workers Seeking professional help from your doctor is the safest way to determine what is causing your rash I have had symptoms of poison ivy rash which was initially on undersides of arms and on front of shins Now over most of my body After two 5 day treatments of 12 steroids a day and steroid cream it is worse than ever during steroid treatments it started to fade but came back with a vengence when the pills stopped I get this too Its due to the high salturea level of your sweat Assuming it irritates your skin but the irritation is in areas like armpits and groin using a barrieranti chafing cream just mustnt be water soluble will reduce the irritation to the point you may not get a rash Id go to the doctor She is probably allergic How big are their nipples Perhaps its time for them to start wearing some sort of bra How much exercise do they regularly get Im a guy and Im in pretty great shape but if I run for a few hours a day every day after taking several weeks off my nipples can get sore from my shirt I imagine it could be the very same problem for a very young girl depending on how much and what type of exercise theyre getting Oh swimming pool  how long did they have their swimming suits on for Probably just a contact rash from having that wet cloth rubbing on their skin as they played around during the day You should see a doctor specializing in Lyme Disease no matter how long ago that the rash was first observed If you have Lyme Disease It can be and still needs to be treated Over 300000 individuals per year are infected with Lyme Disease The condition requires antibiotic treatment to eliminate all bacteria in order to stop further bodily organ damage This bacteria will fester in the body forever until treated completely The Lyme Disease process may start out with a skin rash fatigue and fever and be dismissed as being somewhat annoying but not being worthy of medical intervention Some later stage symptoms of the condition include heart damage neurological defects arthritis and chronic fatigue syndrome Best wishes for your improved health I know most of the questions that may come up As you are telling that you are having skin colored bumps on your arms thighs and legs then it seems like the symptoms or signs of Eczema It is also called as atopic dermatitis It is a treatable disease with oral medicines In this patient usually get itchy dry and red skin Red Itchy rashes can be Eczema in which patient usually get red itchy rashes along with dry skin It is also called as atopic dermatitis You are allergic to your dogs fur I have the same problem where I break out in a rash and itch like crazy I quickly wash the area with anti bactirial soap or take allery medication like Benedryl that is over the counter I have the same problem if I pet my cat and then touch my face without washing my hands My eyes swell up Its a sad thing for pet lovers to go through Try this and see if its any help Good luck Malar rash itself is a manifestation of lupus and can fluctuate in severity or activity It does not necessarily but might correlate with other signs of lupus depending on the individual case The malar rash and other skin manifestations are often treated with Plaquenil I used to play football and suffered from this as well I personally put a little bit of Vaseline on my chin and forehead before putting on my helmet It helped Also if that doesnt work try putting a fungicide on your chin guard and the inside of your helmet It could be a form of jock itch You get sweaty in those helmets and they can be a breeding ground for all sorts of things Hope this helps That is an allergy to the adhesive and possibly latex Could also be allergy to bactracintype of neosporin I have all three Allergist can do a test for them There is a condition called Polymorphous Light Eruption Its a long name we just call it PMLE What happens is that usually when you have short burst of exposure after not being in the sun for a while you notice this rash with the sun and it can be very itchy and uncomfortable This is a sensitivity to the sun As you have continued exposure generally it wears off and then the next time you go on vacation or the next spring is when you will start to see it again Its important to take antihistamines which you can get from your dermatologist or physician or overthecounter Sometimes topical cortisones help calm it down but really avoidance of sun as much as possible is the best way to treat it If you have doubts see your dermatologist Im sorry to hear youre experiencing this As a veteran of skin rashes I can relate This is probably not an emergency room situation Save the ER for those times when you experience chest pain or difficulty breathing A scaly itchy rash on the face can be caused by many things including eczema a likely culprit and psoriasis The only way to tell for sure is to get a physical exam from your primary care provider If the diagnosis is eczema or psoriasis your PCP will be able to tell you how to treat it Id be cautious using Caladryl calamine lotion near the eyes If it gets in your eyes it can cause irritation If you have no known drug allergies you may apply some overthecounter hydrocortisone cream temporarily until you can see your doctor Keep in mind though you want the rash to be visible when you visit your health care provider So take some good photos of it before you use any treatments Best to you Id recommend you get this checked by a doctor Several things can cause the symptoms youre describing from a yeast infection to a sexually transmitted disease Its very important you get an accurate diagnosis in order to receive the correct treatment for the problem Some itching in the vaginal area is normal The rash you described isnt normal nor is the cut or the extreme burning while taking a bath While this is not an emergency situation I hope youre able to see a doctor soon to find out whats going on Meanwhile I would urge you to avoid having sex just in case you do have a sexually transmitted disease such as or  You do not want to give your partner a disease I wish you all the best Interestingly yes you can use breast milk for diaper rash Although Im not aware of any studies that prove it works many women claim it does It certainly cant hurt to try My concern is when you say the rash is all over I hope you mean all over the babys bottom If your baby is having a rash above the waist you should seek medical treatment With diaper rash prevention is better than treatment Remember diaper rashes thrive in moist environments Its very important that you thoroughly and your babys genitals groin and bottom with each diaper change And never leave your baby soaking in wet diapers Change the diapers regularly Instead of commercial baby wipes try cleaning with a soft cloth and plain water to make sure your baby isnt having an allergic skin reaction to something in the wipes Wishing you and your baby well Im sorry youre going through this It sounds awful I have to state though that are not diagnosed by biopsy This makes me question whether or not youve actually seen a medical professional about the situation Regardless the fact your partner now exhibits the same symptoms means you both need to get to a doctor  sooner rather than later Its possible you have some systemic internal disease process that requires attention Sinec the situation has been going on for some time and you do not report any problems breathing or with swelling inside your throat I suggest you seek nonemergency medical attention as soon as possible Wishing you well Im sorry to hear youre going through this How unpleasant Id recommend you have this situation checked out by a doctor If youre scratching something is causing you to itch And you need to find out what is causing the itching It could be something simple like a fungal infection   But then again it could be some type of  While youre waiting for your appointment with a health care provider its very important you Do not have sex even with a condom Do not scratch the affected areas Wash your hands frequently To ease the itching feeling you probably are safe to wash the affected areas gently with warm soapy water and thoroughly dry them You may find it helpful to soak in a tub of warm water with an oatmeal bath Assuming youre not allergic to any medications you might try using a bland powder cornstarch or talc to keep the area dry until you can get a diagnosis from the doctor I wish you all the best Im sorry youre going through this and that the medications didnt give you any relief When symtpoms persist after treatment its always a good idea to return to the doctor to update him or her and get reevaluated Id suggest you do just that Tinea barbae is a type of  which is an inflammation of the hair follicle the part of the hair thats embedded in your skin caused by an infection Tinea barbae is caused by a fungus which is why your health care provider prescribed an antifungal cream clotrimazole to treat it However since that didnt work its time to get the rash rechecked Id suggest you also share with your doctor that overthecounter lotions and creams made the rash worse If possible tell him or her specifically which items you used That may help get you a better diagnosis Good luck to you Well thats kind of weird isnt it Im sorry youre going through this The shoulder and arm area is an odd place to get a rash or a breakout of something like  If the rash is happening only on one side its probably worth having a health care provider look at it though its probably not any sort of emergency If the rash is occurring on both shouldersarms then you might consider causes such as laundry detergent mild allergy or reaction dryer sheets wearing new clothes before washing them a change in the type of soap you use again possibly a mild allergic reaction or something along those lines If the rashblotchiness doesnt clear up on its own or if it gets worse spreads or your begin having swelling of the facemouth andor shortness of breath then you need to seek medical care Best wishes as you try to solve this mystery Aw poor baby You should be pretty safe using a product like baby powder or even plain cornstarch out of the box to treat this possible heat rash If the rash doesnt clear up within the day you might keep an eye on it Its likely nothing serious but it could be something along the lines of a fungal infection similar to athletes foot Be sure to gently cleanse the area with cool water and a mild soap Most important pat it dry thoroughly Dont rub because it will hurt As Im sure you know its not at all unusual for toddlers to develop weird skin rashes that sort of come and go Theyre usually only problematic when they refuse to go OR if the In that case its time to visit the doctor Wishing you and your granddaughter well I would say yes seek immediate medical attention Obviously its impossible to diagnose the situation in a forum like this but your daughter could be experiencing an allergic reaction This should be addressed as soon as possible I hope everything turns out OK This is strange indeed The problem with skin rashes is there are so many things that can cause them Since the rash doesnt itch and presumably doesnt cause any pain its hard to tell what may be causing it Since this started about 3 months ago I would ask if you or your father by any chance changed laundry detergents dryer sheets soap or anything like that Perhaps the cause is environmental since the rash seems to occur in places where clothing touches the skin The only way to tell for sure whats going on is to see a health care provider Your dad can start with his primary care provider who will refer him to a dermatologist if necessary In the meantime it would be helpful to the health care provider if you could get some good photos of the rash both closeup and from far away Because the rash only occurs in the evening your dad may not be exhibiting the rash when he sees his provider Best wishes to you and your dad Aw Im sorry your baby is going through this Uncomfortable is right Im not sure why you believe this diaper rash has turned to a yeast infection but I bow to your wisdom as the parent smile I dont have a lot to offer but I can tell you that regular old cornstarch available at the grocery store near the flour can help dry out the rash and its safe even for baby girls with all those delicate skin folds In fact since it doesnt contain perfume its a good choice for diaper rash in little girls If its possible to dry out your babys bottom by leaving the diaper off altogether for periods of time thats helpful too Whatever you do please do not use any overthecounter OTC yeast infection medications on your baby She may be uncomfortable but shell survive until you get a diagnosis from a health care professional I hope this helps a little bit The steroid preparation that has been linked to the fungal meningitis outbreak was compounded that is made by hand instead of being manufactured in large batches by a pharmacy in New England The steroid of the type youre describing is usually a manufactured product that is widely used to treat rashes allergies and other ailments So to answer your question you are at very low to no risk of contracting fungal meningitis from receiving an intramuscular injection of a massproduced steroid product However you should also discuss this issue with your health care provider He or she can set your mind at ease Hope this helps Im sorry to hear youre going through this Well it could be a rash Or it could be a circulation problem Only a physical examination by a health care provider can say for sure whats going on Id advise you to get this checked out sooner rather than later If its a rash your health care provider can recommend a treatment If its a sign of a larger problem your healthcare provider can get a jump on treating it which means a better outcome for you Theres simply no downside to getting a doctor to look at this Hope this helps psoriasis If so not to worry its quite treatable Its in the blood is what I have grown up hearing about poison oak once you have gotten it on you Always thought that statement was crazy until 6 years ago I accidently got it on me The rash has come up every year without fail in the same exact spot even when I have avoided the outdoors pets and all clothing and bedding washed repeatedly Tried just about every home grown or over the counter cure possible Usually just have to keep the area clean and wait it out The most horrid plant in the universe If your baby has vomiting or diarrhea and is acting unusual she could be dehydrated Dehydration can happen much easier in young children and infants and can make babies irritable cranky and void less have less wet diapers Dehydration can be very serious in a babyyou should take your baby in to your doctor right away Also in a baby who is acting unusual and has a rash it is important to also have her checked out Although most rashes are caused by viruses and tend to get better some may be serious Take your baby to be seen by a docotr right away It really depends on where you were when you recieved the bites If you were in the grass I would say this sounded like chiggers which are tiny little grass dwelling bugs that bite you and cause an itchy rash If not you could be allergic to the bite of whatever it was Or you could even have scratched and caused a skin irritation from that Its hard to tell exactly without further information I would possibly suggest an over the counter hydrocortizone creamaloe vera gel or a good lotion and see if that helps I would be likely to think it is the antibiotics Do you usually get a rash from running a temperature I think you should contact your doctor immediately before you take any more medicine Just my opinion Childrens sunscreen has the right amount of ingredients to protect a childs skin It also doesnt have the perfumes and alcohols that can be found in adult products ingredients which can increase irritation to the skin and lead to rashes If you are looking to utilize one product for the whole family I recommend using a babys or a childs sunscreen product The formulation has less chemicals and will still have the correct SPF protection for everyone Claritin and Zyrtec are not used to treat the itching associated with a foot rash Without seeing the foot rash it is difficult to help in selecting an overthecounter medication for treatment The most common type of foot rash is athletes foot which is caused by a fungus Symptoms include red itching burning areas and sometimes dry white flakes The burning itch associated with the foot rash is treated with antifungal medication Please note having an itch does not always mean that an allergy medication is going to alleviate your symptoms Medications are intended to work for the cause of a specific condition You need to use the appropriate medication for the actual condition Seeking medical advice informing another healthcare professional and asking a pharmacist about all the symptoms that are involved can help to correctly identify and treat your condition Im having similar if not exactly the same symptoms My husbands father had them and I also worked in the medical field Yes they are  They can also cause terrible pain This sounds like exactly what happened to me I was in the most excoriating pain I ever felt and it was blisters and small bumps not puss filled bumps I went to the doctor they said they never seen anything like it and swabbed me for herpes but prescribed me the same medicine that you take for BV The next day after taking the medicine everything went away but I was left not knowing what it really was This has always bothered me because I felt it must have been a herpes outbreak but I tested negative for herpes Please let me know if you found out what this could have been Only a doctor can say for sure but from what youve said it sounds like some form of dermatological irritation If that is the case try using a top notch penis health cream health professionals recommend Man1 Man Oil Look for one that includes a high end emollient like she abutter to soothe the irritated skin and help moisturize the skin Good luck It is probably something minor and easily treatable but it sounds like more than a common cold I would definitely take her to the doctor and keep giving her the benadryl Make sure you keep PLENTY of benadryl on hand even when they arent sick and I would definitely want to take her to the doctor to have that rash looked at You really need to see your physician He will most likely refer you to a Neurologist The numbness and the headache can be serious and should be checked out with an MD immediately Baby acne small bumps on the face head and chest is common from about 1 to 4 months If the baby is not bothered by the rash use plain water when bathing and it will soon go away Check with your doctor for the best treatment if any for your baby since there are many different kinds of rashes Any irritation of the skin in the diaper area can be considered a diaper rash They are extremely common in babies especially those who have loose stools or who have very wet diapers such as infants over 9 months Changes in a childs diet can also cause the stool to irritate a babys skin even if she is changed right away If the baby is not fussy it is likely not a serious rash and will probably go away after a few days of using a diaper cream or ointment If a baby has a fever develops sores in the diaper area has bleeding or pus from the skin has a rash for longer than a few days or seems very uncomfortable its important to have her checked out by the pediatrician Mosquito bites do not cause high fever or hives Horsefly bites cause high fever and hives If you get bitten by a mosquito it just leaves a little red itchy bump Horsefly bites are more serious If you are bitten by a horsefly it leaves a huge red bump about 58 inches long And about 3 days later the bump fades away but then you start to get one itchy bump on a part of your body and if you scratch you break out in the known reaction as hives The best cure for hives is an oatmeal bath or milk of magnesia And of course rest Your husband is probably suffering from postherpethic neuralgia as a result of the herpes zosters virus Consult a doctor immediately and keep the rash clean Having the vaccine does not mean that you will not catch shingles I had the varicella shot as a child and still got chicken pox Vaccines can lesson the intensity of the disease though Dont know if you go to the tanning bed but I went through that It was caused from an ingredient in the tanning lotion It didnt hurt or itch but benedryl done the trick To Dr Moser  I am not selfdiagnosing or selftreating This was prescribed to me by a dermatologist and I am following his instructions for use He never indicated when or if I should stop this treatment I assume since this medication was prescribed and seems to keep the rash suppressed his diagnosis was the correct one Diaper rash is a common problem and I can tell you that there are a few things that parents can do to help prevent it and then there is also ways to treat it Preventing it what you want to do is make sure you change the baby frequently You dont want them to sit in a white wet diaper all the day long and by actually cleaning the area very well and letting it air dry little bit before you put on the next diaper You want to carry things in your house as far as wipes to make sure you clean the area throughly and use things something like Desitin ointment which is a zinc oxide base It actually will create a watertight barrier that will help prevent moisture from staying on the skin There is also Boudreauxs Butt Paste which is another popular product just as good as Desitin has the same active ingredient in it If you notice though that the rash is becoming a little bit more inflamed and red seems to be spreading baby is running a fever then you want to have it checked out by your pediatrician Because they may actually need prescription medication because it could have became a little more fungal Speaking of fungal the one thing that I think a lot of parents do is put cornstarch on a baby when they are doing the diaper change and that is actually not something that you want to do It actually help trap in fungus So dont use any powder at all One of the questions I have to ask is how long have you had the rash Sometimes people break out from foods new laundry detergents or new soap This could be a possible cause if it not due to the bed bugs Due to the fact youre pregnant I would recommend using a colloidal oatmeal bath like Aveeno and if it continues see your health care provider I would monitor the rash and if it appears to be getting worse  warm to touch swollen or spreading  you will need to go to the doctor for evaluation Since you are sensitive to these types of bites have you considered applying a topical product before you go out to avoid bites There are a variety of different products on the market in various forms There are even some sunscreens that now contain repellents Our doctor prescribed Triamcinolone Acetonide Ointment 01 and we used it twice a day It got rid of the rash and we started using a chin guard sleeve so that no matter what there is no skin in contact with the sweaty chin guard the rash will stay away then Nike makes soccer chin guard sleeves and sells them at Dicks I meant to add that they also make chin strap sleeves too my son plays lacrosse and they sell them in the lacrosse section or maybe online Use the medication and use the sleeve to get rid of the rash Hi it sounds like lichens planus Not sure of spelling For itching try an oral antihistamine non drowsy Hope this helps I suffer with a lot of derm issues Also maybe a womens over the counter anti cream vagisil might bring some relief PICS urlhttpimageshackusphotomyimages651100mediaimag0514jpgimghttpimageshackusaimg6515831100mediaimag0514thjpgurl

health crme with vitamins and amino acids is a good idea Good luck  Yep definitely try that Ive been through some of this stuff too and one of the reasons I use Man1 Man Oil is because of the vitamin

should go away in a couple of days If not wait wait go see the doctor  It is possible Any time you change medications you could experience a new side effect However not all new symptoms are caused by medications You would need to have your rash examined by a doctor in order to see if it is simply a drug side effect or if something unrelated to the medication is causing the rash It is not recommended to take more medication than you were prescribed If a medication you were prescribed is not working you should consult the healthcare professional that prescribed it and let them know It may be that the medication is not right for your condition and that something else besides an allergy is causing your itching Yes If your child develops a rash while taking amoxicillin it is important to contact hisher pediatrician immediately It could be a sign of an allergic reaction or a harmless side effect But the only way to tell is to have it examined by a doctor No The reaction you described would not be considered normal If you experience a rash from a medication you should contact your doctor immediately It could be a sign of an allergic reaction to the medication or a serious side effect My son had a strange rash like this once and our Dr said that he must have encountered a plant or other such thing that he was allergic to while playing Since a farm has thousands of things to get into we never did find out what the allergy was The rash was head to toe and he looked like he had a massive sunburn The Dr prescribed Childrens Benedryl and the rash cleared right up Benedryl is over the counter and is dosed according to the package Try it out and see if you have the kind of luck we had with it Jock itch is a possibility However that rash is usually itchy so that

from httpdermnetnzorgreactionsprogesteronedermatitishtml Autoimmune progesterone dermatitis APD is a rare skin condition in women that recurs in a cyclical manner corresponding to their menstrual cycles It is thought to be a response of the skin to the hormonal changes that happen just before menses Characteristically the skin eruptions occur during the luteal phase or the late premenstrual phase of the cycle This is when the blood level of the sexhormone progesterone rises The skin rash happens as an autoimmune response to the bodys own progesterone hence its name Within a few days of menstruation when progesterone level falls there is partial to complete resolution of the rash It will recur during the next cycle Some patients have had previous exposure to external progesterone in the form of oral contraceptive pills This is thought to presensitize patients to react against their own internal progesterone However not all patients with APD are exposed to previous hormone therapy It has been postulated that these patients produce an altered form of progesterone that incites an immunologic response against it In another theory progesterone is thought to heighten a patients hypersensitivity response to another allergen Diagnosis The diagnosis is usually made from the characteristic cyclical presentation A skinprick test with intradermal progesterone is helpful Positive tests with progesterone can be fairly rapid usually developing as urticaria within 30 minutes of inoculation or delayed with rashes peaking at 2448 hours Provocative testing with intramuscular or oral progesterone can be performed as an alternative Skin biopsy alone is seldom diagnostic A variety of histological features have been described Superficial perivascular mixed inflammation is the most consistent finding Treatment the skin problem is mild it may improve with topical steriods for eczema and antihistamines for urticaria Severe disease may be treated with corticosteroids The production of progesterone can be suppressed with hormonebased therapy This includes the use of conjugated oestrogen American spelling estrogen ethinyl oestradiol estradiol tamoxifen and danazol Women with autoimmune progesterone dermatitis should try to avoid medications containing progesterone including the combined oral contraceptive pill minipill depo injections The specific drugs to avoid include norethindrone norgestrel levonorgestrel Surgical removal of ovaries or oophrectomy has been shown to be curative in refractory cases Dop hope this helps you Good Luck Hi See Above Answer sorry it wont

find some how this will work for you I just dont know all you can do is give it a try Do hope this helps you Good Luck I am glad that you went to the doctor for an exam and testing From what you have described it does not sound like Herpes A primary new infection typically takes 2 to 14 days to present itself A Herpes outbreak typically lasts 13 weeks and consists of blisters which cause pain itching and burning I need to know whether you mean blocked URETHRA the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body or blocked URETER one of the two tubes that lead each from one of the kidneys to the urinary bladder My late father once had a kidney stone that blocked one of his ureters causing hydronephrosis  his urine was backing up into the kidney It was very dangerous and his urologist had to install a stent to keep the ureter open wider until he passed the kidney stone During the time he had the stent he became temporarily incontinent and had to wear mens Depends but after it was resolved that problem went away Years later however both his kidneys failed completely Since he was dying of cancer at the time no one ever figured out why If you have a blocked ureter the kidney to which it belongs will develop hydronephrosis unless it is treated a urologist would need to tend to that and quickly If on the other hand what is blocked is not one of the ureters but your urethra that would also be an emergency possibly a much more immediately urgent one If the urethra is totally blocked the bladder cannot empty at all and will eventually burst upward through the dome Depending upon why the urethra is blocked treatment may involve passing a catheter into the bladder or even emergency surgery to remove the obstruction If the urethra is partially blocked only a small amount of urine may emerge the bladder will become overdistended and a UTI will be highly likely to develop plus the condition will be extremely painful In that case it becomes necessary to have a catheter passed into the bladder to empty it and then the condition that caused the blocked urethra treated In men this is most likely to be caused by a swollen prostate gland In women injury to the urethra and certain types of vaginal swelling are most likely though many other conditions are possible In either case  whether its your urethra or one of your ureters that is blocked  it needs medical attention The sooner the better As for the skin rash a doctor would have to look at that to see if its connected but I do know that in actual kidney failure small crystals of uric acid or urea salts actually emerge through the pores of the skin but by the time this happens the person is near death and is not likely to be using a computer The rash could still be connected in some way to the underlying condition though because it is true that either a blocked ureter or a blocked urethra result in toxins not being properly eliminated by the body The most important thing is to get medical treatment for the blockage and then tend to the rest Good Luck Yes the rash can return to same area months later Once you have been exposed to this plant and even thought the rash itself may have long since healed or faded away the underlying skin proteins remain sensitized to urushiol for quite some time in some cases several years hence the slightest newest recent exposure to urushiol in certain individuals will cause you to experience for a second or third time a newer rash Breathing in the flower pollen also in certain individuals will cause them to develop a rash Exposure frequency and time interval duration between each successive pi exposure to a large extent will determine how severe your rash outbreak will not only be but how long it will last I am 73 years old female and have the exact same symptoms I went to my doctor thinking it might be shingles She said no it was probably some type of allergic reaction maybe caused by anxiety She recommended Claritin which can be purchased over the counter There are many many causes for a rash but when one shows up in school teachers assume the worst They are worried about measles chicken pox Lyme disease scarlet fever Fifth disease impetigo herpes simplexzoster handfootmouth disease MRSA or roseola just to name a few It is this fear of imminent contagiousness that leads to the childs exclusion from school Sometimes the skin eruption is due to allergies such as hives or just a worsening dryskin condition like eczema atopic dermatitis Even a cold virus whether its in a cold thats at the contagious stage or not can cause a rash Fortunately for all of us most rashes that children get are not serious or contagious I have seen children excluded for insect bites hives sunburns poison oakivy eczema and even zits Teachers are not dermatologists so they are not going to make the diagnosis The school is just going to exclude the child and require a clearance note before the child can return I had a child excluded this week with poison oak Poison oak is not contagious but at least half of the people I encounter think that it is The oleoresin of the Rhus plant is definitely contagious but once this oil has been washed off of the contaminated skin clothing and other objects it can no longer cause trouble When people see this ugly rash oozing they assume the drainage is the poison This is not true Once the person takes a good shower and changes their clothes they do not need to be treated like they have leprosy High school wrestlers tend to get a variety of skin infections from those contaminated mats I see common warts molluscum another wartlike skin lesion impetigo a staph or strep skin infection and more recently MRSA a potentially serious drugresistant Staph infection Of course the wrestlers are also excluded from participation because of eczema mosquito bites and other noncontagious skin issues Referees and coaches are getting better in recognizing skin problems I must say Its not measles I must say this statement a dozen times a week contradicting home diagnoses made by daycare providers and grandmothers Measles is relatively rare in the United States now Personally I have not seen a case in over 20 years thanks to the effectiveness of vaccinations A few hundred to a few thousand cases still occur in the US depending on the year in unvaccinated individuals Mosquito and flea bites can mimic early chicken pox lesions but only for a short while Chicken pox varicella looks like a dew drop sitting on a rose petal It is a tiny blister on a red base which turns into a scab followed by a tiny crater pox in a day or so Although varicellaimmunized children can get a mild case it really does look different than mosquito bites Chicken pox is caused by the herpes virus so reexposure to this disease later in life can cause a reactivation of the virus resulting in herpes zoster also known as shingles Warts are contagious but not very much To exclude a child from school because of warts is really unnecessary It can take a month or more to effectively treat a case of stubborn warts freezing them with liquid nitrogen or chemically burning them with various acids High school wrestlers with warts can wrestle as long as they are covered by clothing or a bandage but many are excluded from participation by an eagleeyed referee You may have a genetic condition called KERATOSIS PILARIS  Keep in mind that this is just a guess since I cannot examine you I suspect one of your parents have this as well This is a very common skin condition and very difficult to treat impossible to cure If it helps I have it too Do a Google Search for medical articles about keratosis pilaris Impetigo is not due to a virus It is due to a bacteria either Strep Staph or both This is why it is treated with antibiotics either topical creams or ointments or orally like penicillin tablets Impetigo is contagious by both direct and indirect contact surfaces contaminated with the bacteria to a person who is susceptible Unlike highly contagious diseases like chicken pox varicella impetigo does not spread through the air or through sneezing An exposed person will not necessary catch it but they can especially if you have an open area of your skin use the same towel etc Your roommate has a responsibility to you and others to keep the impetigo covered and use at least a topical antibiotic ointment or cream until it is healed For you keep your hands clean and avoid touching your own mouth or nose  two favorite places that it likes to live However impetigo  those honeycrusted oozing sores  can occur anywhere on your skin surface A change in climate can certainly be a factor for a heat rash Sort of both depending on the stage of the infection Shingles will mostly present as painful blisters  Assuming she was diagnosed accurately by a lab test and given the appropriate medication Strep should be improving in a few days She hasnt be on the medication very long The antibiotic is really given to prevent Strep complications not to help the pain so hopefully you are giving something for the discomfort If the Strep was not accurately diagnosed her doctor should consider a viral infection such as mono as a possibility Then perhaps you need to go one step further and see a dermatologist It would not be possible to determine a diagnosis over the Internet based solely on a vague description An allergic reaction would typically itch and have hives but not always I have no way of really knowing if you had a Cefzil allergic reaction or not but you can have a skin test to be sure A person with 5th disease erythema infectiosum can have occasional relapses of the lacy rash on the lower arms and thighs as well as the characteristic slapped face appearance for weeks after the initial disease The best way to get an uncontaminated urine specimen from a child is with urinary catherization Getting accurate results from using a bag over the genital area is nearly impossible because of the colonization of enteric colon bacteria bacteria on the skin Not clear if your child is a lttle boy or girl You most likely are having an allergic response to one of the ingredients in the deodorantantiperspirant so you will need to do some shopping I have the same problems One of the best ones that I found personally was made by Arm and Hammer but unfortunately it went off the market Had I had known I would have stocked up It took me a while and then I found Soft n Dry which went off the market too I am now using Dove a little bit on the girly side but it works and no itching I am not sure if any of these will help so it is really trial and error One additional suggestion Before putting on deodorant rub in some 1 hydrocortisone cream This may help the itching and control any mild allergic response Or you can move to parts of Europe and give up deodorant entirely It is not possible to determine the nature of a rash based on a vague description so you will need to see a medical provider so you can have this allover rash properly examined diagnosed and treated Since you are concerned that this could be a consequence of unprotected sex seeing a medical provider is even more important If necessary the medical provider can test you for HIV and other sexuallytransmitted diseases If you want to know that answer you are going to need to SEE a medical provider so that you can be properly examined There is absolutely no way for me or any medical provider to blindly make an accurate diagnosis over the Internet There are zillions of different rashes but high on that list would need to be yeast because of its location Rather than worry about infidelity or an STD just see your medical provider be examined and leave with the right answerand most likely the proper treatment You are correct about it appearing to spread based on your original exposure You may have been exposed by the oils on your clothing or shoes that you touched later or by some of the tools you used to cut it down The oleoresin is so stable that it can last on objects for YEARS so you better carefully wash any clothing or objects that may have become contaminated If you have a dog and dog came in contact with poison ivy the oil can be on the fur so wash the dog too In my opinion there is no such thing as a mild case of poison ivy so I tend to treat them more aggressively based on my own childhood experience of the misery it causes Prescription prednisone topical steroids and oral antihistamines is the treatment of choice so it is time to consult a medical provider I cant see the rash to offer you a patientspecific answer but those one year old vaccines are LIVE vaccines with a two week incubation period so it is common for the chicken pox AND the measlesmumpsrubella MMR vaccine to cause a mild rash If this is related to the vaccine then there is really nothing that needs to be doneit will resolve on its own in a few days Keep in mind however that there are hundreds of other things that can cause a rash Herpes would not be high on a diagnostic list based on what you have described While it would be impossible to blindly offer you a definitive answer without examining you more likely possibilities would include chaffing like you mentioned or a fungal skin infection tinea cruris also known as jock itch  a common skin condition that occurs in warm dark moist skin areas You would need to see a medical provider if this condition persists or worsens This is really the only way to be properly diagnosed and treated The rash from Strep is called scarletina or Scarlet Fever It would be VERY uncommon in a ten month old and I would definitely confirm this with a culture This type of rash is brightred covers the entire body and the child is very very ill Later this rash will peel like a sunburn and can last a week or more I have no way to examine your child over the Internet but I would question the diagnosis Thrush is yeastnot a bacteria and it does not cause a general skin rash other than a diaper rash The drug Nystatin is unlikely to cause a rash Whole body rash and itching is NOT shingles Is it possible that your doctors diagnosis was incorrect You may need to see him again Shingles is PAINFUL not itchyand it only affects a section of ONE SIDE of the body it follows a nerve pathway It is not possible to diagnose what could it be a rash simply by its location The skin only does one thingit rashes and there are thousands of different things that can cause it If the steroid cream you are using is not helping then one possibility would be yeast Yes yeast loves warm dark most places and the area under the breast is a common site to have a cutaneous skin yeast infection Again I am not blindly telling you that you have yeast This is jsut one of the many possibilities You would need to see a medical provider for an examination to make that diagnostic call Your nephew had a common reaction to amoxicillin I see it a few times a month in my practice This is not an allergic reaction but merely an innocent side effect that usually happens toward the end of the amoxicillin course The rash will most likely fade in a few days Since he did have this reaction it would be best that he not take amoxcillin or similar penicillin drugs in the future I cant see your rash but onesided blisters are more likely to be shingles Kidney stones do not cause rashes and the type of pain is extremely deep They do NOT look alikebut a person can sure have both Eczema atopic dermatitis is a chronic itchy dry skin condition that really likes some of those spots that you mentioned Eczema can come and go over a lifetime A mainstay of treatment is moisturization reducing inflammation and controlling this itching using an antihistamine Poison oak dermatitis tends to form linear vesiculationsblisters that form a line of sorts It tends to ooze appearing on the mostexposed to the plant oils area first then to other areas that may have been touched by contaminated hands or objects After a shower and a change of clothes poison oak does not spread by this drainage nor can you spread it to others Poison oak dermatitis lasts a few weeks and is mosteffectively treated by oral and topical steroids Itching can be controlled by antihistamines Calamine may help but shaving against the grain may have resulted in a condition called folliculitis  a skin infection that involves the hair follicles An antibacterial cream may be preferable I am very sorry but a diagnosis requires an examination  not something that can be accomplished on WebMD Answers Your description is vague and the possibilities are numerous Since the penis is covered by skin and you have a dermatologist seeing this professional would be advisable An accurate diagnosis  not a blind guess  is essential to get a patientspecific treatment regime In most cases your treatment will involve a prescription medication again not something that can be provided to you online Leave your penis alone assuming your dermatitis has resolved Allow your skin to recover without challenging it with additional creams and ointments I suspect it will return to its normal nonshiny appearance soon As you may know I cant blindly diagnose you over the Internet but I can tell you that chicken pox lesions look like dew drops on a rose petal tiny blister on a red base Herpes zoster the same virus also tends to have blisters at first but in groups These are painful and only ONE side of the body Pimples and white heads do not sound herpetic to me As much as I would like to help you it would not be possible for me or any medical professional to diagnose your boyfriends skin eruption based on your vague description Triamcinalone is NOT a treatment for jock itch Jock itch is typically tinea cruris a FUNGAL infection Two problems Triamcinalone can make fungus worse and triamcinalone should NOT be used in the groin area This is a steroid cream that can actually be absorbed by the body and cause immune suppression over long term use You are treating this problem entirely wrong if you are selfdiagnosing and selftreating You must have an accurate dermatological diagnosis This is not something you can get blindly over the Internet so if your dermatologist was correct than you should have been treated with an antifungal I am not sure what he meant by related to jock itch so you may need to call himher to discuss your failure to improve assuming he was the one who prescribed the triamcinalone cream A contact dermatitis would be high on my lista sensitivity reaction to a detergent even if you havent changed detergents andor a dryer softener Perfumed Bounce for example Even perfumed toilet paper can be a culprit I suspect her father uses different soaps detergents and may not have a washer that carefully rinses  guys are not very good at laundry Of course not bathing could be contributory as well I have no way of seeing this rash over the Internet but my concern would be that the cat scratch has caused a skin infection that may require oral antibiotics Cat scratches are notorious for causing skin infections incidentally I dont knowI cant examine you but based on the limited information that you shared you need to remain on those antibiotics that I assume your medical provider gave you A rash on the arm does not imply the infection is in your bloodstream septicemia Septicemia causes high fever lethargy and you are very very ill Obviously I do not know anything about you age medical history nor can I examine this skin eruption Making a blind guess is difficult but a common under the breast growing red skin eruption could be candidiasis a yeast infection You would need to see your medical provider so that you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated There are LOTS of other skin eruptions that can cause these symptoms but unfortunately I have no way of seeing what you have over the Internet Scabies is typtically transmitted persontoperson but it is possible that it could be transmitted on contaminated equipment There are skin scraping tests to determine if you have scabies but your doctor may not be set up to do it You may need to see a dermatologist I have to say that scabies typically does not spread like this nor is it common on the face so there is a good chance you have something else If you have isolated the underarm rash to the deodorant then you may have your culprit Hydrocortisone 1 used three times per day would be the recommended treatment for contact dermatitis but it is not a cureall Sometimes your medical provider will need to prescribed a topical steroid that is stronger Common area No but herpes zoster shingles follows a nerve pathway so this painful infection can occur in this area Hopefully your doctor prescribed the appropriate antiherpetic viral medications for you These are quite helpfu Pain medication is also important since this can last a while longer How long It would not be possible to make an accurate prediction since this is really up to your immune system but I would expect that you would be considerably improved in a week if you had the antiviral medication The fever headache and flulike symptoms are typical of shingles so hang in there They are completely different You can find plenty of chicken pox varicella photos on the Internet Obviously I have no way of seeing what your son has so you will need to take him to see a medical provider for a proper exam diagnosis and treatment Yesyou can use probiotics but that will not solve the sore bottom Not all diaper rashes are the samesome are caused simply by the acidic irritation of having diarrhea but some can be yeast or even bacterial Each would be treated differently of course Since I cant diagnose your baby over the Internet I can make a little suggestion that I use for my own patients Use a combination of an antiyeast cream over the counterthe pharmacist can help you pick one AND 1 hydrocortisone cream for the inflammation Rub a small amount well in those sore areas and then cover this with a barrier cream or ointment AD Desitin zinc oxide Vaseline etc Change the diaper frequently and make sure you wipe of ALL traces of stool even if you have to give them a bath If the area is bleeding or getting worse you will need to have it examined by the pediatrician I dont know since I cannot SEE this rash Sorry You would need to take this child to see a medical provider so he can be properly examined diagnosed and treated if necessary You most likely have hives urticaria This can be causes by HUNDREDS of different things so it would not be possible for me to determine the one or many causes Soaps detergents dryer softener sheets foods medications and hundreds of other things may be the culprit Assuming you can take an antihistamine Claritin Zyrtec Allegra or Benadryl this may helpful at bedtime to see if this can be prevented otherwise you may need to see your medical provider Not likely since you have been on this thyroid medication for over a year Look for other reasons Many rashes look similar to measles but a vaccinated child at age 12 months should not be contracting measles unless there was a confirmed direct exposure Measles is uncommon in the US now but I do not know where you live Have her examined by her medical provider and read a bit more about the signs and symptoms of measles on WebMD A rash is not the only sign I cant really answer that important questionnamely since I have no way of seeing this skin eruption first hand by examination One of many considerations should be shingles herpes zoster but this is just a blind guess based solely on your very vague description I would suggest that you see a medical professional so you can have this properly diagnosed and treated The first and most important step is to have these red bumps properly diagnosed by a medical professional such as a dermatologist It would not be possible for me or any medical provider to be able to blindly determine exactly what these red bumps might be over the Internet Making a dermatological diagnosis is very visual Treatment would depend on your diagnosis which is not known He needs to SEE a medical provider This important step is really the ONLY way that he can be properly examined diagnosed and treated  three things that cannot be accomplished online Extreme discomfort is a highlymotivating symptoms so perhaps he can now be convinced to do the right thing and not make excuses Having his girlfriend post a question online is not a substitute for proper medical care You can see this eruptionI cannot so seeing your dermatologist is the appropriate next step A description is really not sufficient to make an accurate dermatological diagnosis let alone rule out such obscure things as skin cancer There can be HUNDREDS of reasons Incidentally it would be highly unusual to have cancer in this area so dont worry too muchjust have your dermatologist make this important call You are most likely getting hives Hives can be caused by the temperature change that you mentioned You can try taking a longacting antihistamine before these warm season exposures loritidine Zyrtec Allegra to see if it helps Urticaria caused by temperature changes may not be prevented by antihistamines however but it is worth a try Keeping your skin surface cooler would also seem to be a reasonable preventative wearing clothing that breathes About a few thousand different medical problems can cause those symptoms It would be impossible to blindly determine the cause of your symptoms over the Internet so I would suggest that you see a medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated  three essential components that cannot be accomplished online This is called cold urticaria one of the more unique types of hives You can try using an antihistamine before cold exposure but it still may happen Unfortunately there is little that can be done other than avoiding these cold situations Eczema atopic dermatitis can become worse during times of stress The dry rash can appear on any part of the body that has skin If you are having ongoing issues seeing a dermatologist would be appropriate Your vaginal yeast infection would not be related to eczema I cant see your skin eruption but not all rashes are chicken pox I would also question the accuracy of the diagnosis if you were told you had chicken pox four times The varicella vaccine is a live virus but not one that can cause a true contagious case of chicken pox See your medical provider and have that mysterious rash properly diagnosed Not without seeing it firsthand my friend Dermatology is a visual art Hundreds of different things can cause allergic reaction including the doxycycline but neither has sulfa The prednisone can help fight an allergic reaction an antihistamine may also help Yes you can workout Poison ivy cannot be spread to others from your skin but it would be courteous to keep in covered if you can Hopefully you are under treatment for it Unfortunately it would not be possible for me or any medical provider to be able to diagnosis a rash without actually seeing it firsthand A description is really not sufficient to make this important diagnostic call and without a diagnosis treatment suggestions would also not be possible You will need to see a medical provider or dermatologist so that you can be be properly diagnosed and treated Assuming you do have shingles your description was not convincing a person must have had chicken pox in the past A new exposure to someone with chicken pox may give you shingles herpes zoster Since chicken pox is contagious a day before many people do not know who exposed them 2 or 3 weeks prior Chicken pox varicella is very contagious by direct contact or fomites objects contaminated by the varicella virus Shingles is really the same virus but fortunately not as contagious One can get it by direct exposure however The skin only reacts in ONE WAYa rash  There are a few thousand things that can result in a skin eruption so the answer is yes it could be something else As you know I cant see this rash over the Internet but newborns can get several types of skin eruptionsatopic dermatitis eczema milia newborn acne from the mothers maternal hormones and moistureheat related skin eruptionsjust to name a few A photo rarely helps when it comes to these more challenging diagnoses As much as I would like to help you solve this five year mystery this cannot be accomplished without at handson examination Because of the long duration of this problem and failure with various treatments I would strongly suggest that you see a dermatologist for an expert evaluation The diagnosis is the keyso unless you get a definitive diagnosis the treatment would just be random trials An allergic reaction is often sudden HIVES that are very pruritic itchy An amoxicillin side effect usually occurs near the end of the course of treatment day 810 not day three and is bright red occuring all over the body This does not usually itch Soit could be either one I dont have enough specific information and the ability to examine your baby to offer you a definitive answer You must first identify the causenot something that I can do for you over the Internet One possible culprit would be enzymatic detergents like Tide or perfumed dryersoften sheets Bounce etc that cause a contact dermatitis Of course there can be many other considerations Until you figure it out rewash your sheets in a milder detergent and dont use a softener Take a longacting antihistamine at bedtime if gte

I use for my little patients is to mix the yeast medication with an equal amount of hydrocortisone cream to help the redness and inflammation Put in on the diaper area at least 34 times per day Once this medication is rubbed in put a barrier cream or ointment over the top  something like plain ol vaseline Airout the diaper area as much as you can After a bowel movement you may need to put the in the bathtub or shower to make sure you get off all of the stool residual this can burn the skin Bad diaper rashes can also predispose the child to a secondary bacterial infection so if the skin is breaking down or bleeding you will need to contact her medical provider to see if an oral antibiotic would be appropriate if gte mso 9xml wLatentStyles DefLockedStatefalse LatentStyleCount156

be correct about fungus  common pathogen in this moist area would be a condition called tinea cruris Tinea cruris typically itches however but it can be very red moist and irritated Another possibility would be contact dermatitis often from a fabric softener detergent or soap No young man really wants to go to a medical provider to get his scrotum examined but this is really the only way to be properly diagnosed and treated I think you mean psoriasis  a common dermatological condition that can appear on any skin surface including the scalp I am not sure what the inverse part is but then again I am not a dermatologist So to address your question Yes it is possible to have psoriasis on the scalp There are many different medications from steroid solutions to shampoos that can help and there are prescription and overthecounter medications to control the itching Give your dermatologist a call and ask for some help Yes a yeast infection can do this Rather than assume they are both connected you would be wise to see your medical provider for an examination and prescription treatment No a normal CBC will not tell you if you have active syphilis or not but there are many sensitive tests that your doctor can order to answer that trouble syphilis fear Unfortunately I do not have enough medical history about you or have the ability to delve into your clinical case to discuss the significance of a normal or abnormal CBC as it relates to you You will need to address this with your medical provider  someone who has the ability to correlate any lab findings with your history and physical examination results There are prescription medications for this condition usually a mild steroid Even the over the counter 1 hydrocortisone cream can help Many clinicians also recommend using mild soap to wash this area like Johnsons Baby Shampoo This will not even burn your eyes Valtrex will not help a rash related to mononucleosis There are THOUSANDS of medical conditions that can result in a rash so it would not be wise to associate your sons mono with your rash The rash seen in mono does not usually itch Since I cannot see your rash and examine you over the Internet I would advise you to see a medical provider so you can be properly diagnosed I dont know what she is taking but there is a very common amoxicillin side effect that can produce a rash near the end of the antibiotic course of treatment Scarlet fever tends to be a generalized all over the body bright red sandpaperyrough skin rash that will eventually peel especially on the palms and feet A person would not typically get a scarlet fever eruption on day six using an antibiotic that could treat strep again I dont know what she is taking Was your daughter labdiagnosed with Strep rapid strep swab or a Strep culture or was it a clinical diagnosis the medical provider just examined her throat and said Strep Clinical diagnoses of Strep are no more accurate than a cointoss in most instances UTIs are very rare in men assuming you are male If you are having unprotected sex and diagnosed with NGU really this is Chlamydia all the letters NGU really mean is that you do not have gonorrhea Hopefully the STD clinic ran the appropriate lab tests Urethritis is really an infection or inflammation of the urethraperiod Urethritis can have many causes but Chlamydia is high on that list I cant really diagnose you blindly over the Internet but your penile rash has nothing to do with urethritis I dont know what ointment you are using but if it is getting better than good Lots of things can cause an itchy rashthousands of diseases and conditions in fact You and your sister need to be medical examined so that you can be properly diagnosed and treated  not something that can be accomplished over the Internet It is not likely that your granddaughter has shingles on BOTH of her hands Shingles follows a nerve pathway and occurs just on one side of the body like the face chest or back Shingles is caused by the herpes virus the same virus that causes fever blisters cold sores and chicken pox Shingles does not occur on both hands so that blisterlike rash needs to be properly diagnosed It could be a form of eczema impetigo handfootmouth disease or any number of skin conditions that can occur on the hands Check the bottoms of her feet and inside her mouthif you see similar lesions it may be hand foot and mouth disease  A search of WebMD will provide you with more information on this curious childhood illness Remember that just exposure to an infectious disease yes shingles is contagious does not necessarily mean the exposed person will get it Unfortunately without the ability to actually see this skin eruption that you are describing it would be very difficult if not impossible to blindly offer an accurate diagnosis A diagnosis is really essential when it comes to treatment Knowing your medical history will also help solve this mystery rash Based solely on your description this could be an allergic reaction perhaps urticaria hives Hives are intensely itchy comes on suddenly and if the allergen is still in your midst it can continue to persistspread Regardless of the cause which can be very challenging to find the itchiness can be treated with an antihistamine like diphenhydramine Benadryl or other overthecounter medications in this class Seeing a medical provider is important since many things can mimic hives Poison ivy or oak is caused by exposure to the olioresin oil of the plant It does not come back in the same place two months later unless you were reexposed to the oil again The oil can remain stable on an object for years so you dont have to come in contact with plantjust an object that still has the oil on it Please be sure you actually have poison ivy Many skin eruptions can mimic this allergic disorder and some can even show up in the same place like eczema shingles etc Hi Weirdly enough one of the best rash medicines is for athletes foot A nurse recommended it for diaper rash for my baby because its cheaper than baby rash meds and works better Another help if the symptoms are bothersome is natural yogurtit replaces nutrients naturally Both work great You are wise to begin treatment so quickly for your shingles infection This will help to limit its spread However even on medication the shingles lesions are going to erupt where the infection initially began because it is present before the rash develops Hopefully yours will be a mild case and being on medication will limit the extent to which it will spread Unfortunately almost a third of all diabetics may be more prone to certain types of fungal infections candidiasis or oral thrush Many diabetics are also at a greater risk for secondary bacterial infections such as folliculitis infection of the hair follicles carbuncles deep soft tissue infections and paronychia infections around the nail bed Many of these infections may present initially as a rash Therefore any suspected rash on a diabetic should be evaluated by your physician You may suffer from a nickel allergy Most metals even gold contain small amounts of nickel Consider applying a small amount of clear nail polish on the metal that is adjacent to your skin For the brand labels consider removing them or changing your detergent to a fragrance free hypoallergenic solution Did you ever figure it out I am a RN and am having the same problem doctors tell me to take Benadryl which makes it difficult to work efficiently as I am exhausted when taking this medication I have not yet seen a dermatologist but would like to know what you found out No YES it can be related My thyroid was removed in 1973 when I was 21 yrs old due to benign adenoma I took Armour for 10 yrs then switched to Synthroid for 10 yrs In 1991 I began having severe hives and red burned face My family dr immediately suspected thyroid meds Allergists insisted no way was it that I suffered for 8 months until my gynecologist took me off synthroid hives immediately began subsiding then on Armour and hives returned but looked different Took me off ALL hormone for 6 weeks and follow up with endocrinologist Said I would feel very tired  but I felt GREAT All my levels were normal and have remained so for 21 yrs Chapped lips hydrate  dont lick your lips possibly scabies The itching is intense at night often not noticed during day It will be better if you see a doctor so you can have a clear understanding about the skin condition that you are in right now You may also visit httpwwwclearcliniccom for great ideas on skin care 20 years ago my husband and i both got shingles at the same time i was 36 and he was 56 we had just moved out of an apartment complex where there was at least 10 cases of chicken pox with the little kids i had chicken pox as a child but my husband said he did not when we asked the drhe said it is not contagious that when my husband was little he probably had a minor case and no one knew i asked how that could happen my doc says when one person gets chicken pox the next person to get can be so minor they only get 1 or 2 chicken pox and go on never knowing they had it or the virus my heartly congratz for your daughterpregnant ladies do develope some purplish lines  rashes its common but in your daughters condition it may be due to the polluted water also i need some exact details from your daughter so that i can suggest you right way to handle her I also have this problemn cant figure it outI take Zyrtec every couple daysthat helpsthen a day or two later its backnot know what n why bothers me as much as the itchinghope someone figures it out Well I have tried the doctor multiple times My area has no dermatologist so I have to travel over a he to find one I have the doctor office sending a list of dermatologists I could see Until then Im trying to get some info here I have tried multiple creams and its still persistent nervous of an std I guess and just flat out frightened So yes I am trying to see a dermatologist but is little difficult with my career at this point No vacation yet I too get Impetigo yearly The specific strain that I get is unique to my body and is not contagious to anyone else I have had it since I was an infant For years the doctors could not figure out what it was because if it wasnt highly contagious it could not have been Impetigo or so they thought Your friend has the same situation as me It is very rare to have a strain of Impetigo that is not contagious but that doesnt mean it doesnt exist If you are still unsure wash your hands regularly and disinfect surfaces and commonly touched items I have never spread my Impetigo to another person when I was younger my siblings would tease me about my Impetigo and I would rub it on them and angrily try to make them get it as wellto no avail It sounds like tha going around Id definitly get them to the hospitol so theres no dehydrationt flu or virus thats I would definitly take her or take her back to the emergency room and let them do more tests Chances are if you have lived in the US for most of your life you have been exposed to Chicken Pox even if you didnt show symptoms The

the article linked to below Good skin care is a key component in controlling eczema For some people with mild eczema modifying their skin care regime and making a few lifestyle changes may be all that is needed to treat eczema Other people with more severe eczema may need to take medications to control their symptoms Nondrug treatments for eczema include Mild soap and moisturizer  Its best to use a mild soap to avoid over drying your skin Gentle soaps known as syndets are available at the drugstore and brand names can be recommended by your doctor A good moisturizer in cream lotion or ointment form helps conserve the skins natural moisture and should be applied immediately after a shower or bath as well as one other time each day Some people with severe eczema may benefit from taking baths with a small amount of bleach added to the water The bleach helps to kill bacteria that lives on the skin of people with eczema Short warm showers  People with eczema should avoid taking very hot or long showers or baths which can dry out your skin Reduce stress  Take steps to reduce stress Get regular exercise and set aside time to relax Medications used to treat eczema include Hydrocortisone cream  Overthecounter hydrocortisone cream may help mild eczema Prescription steroid cream may be needed for more severe eczema Antihistamines  Oral antihistamines such as Benedryl are available overthecounter and may help relieve symptoms Some of these may cause drowsiness which may be of benefit if nighttime itching is a problem Corticosteroids  If other treatments fail your doctor may prescribe oral corticosteroids Always follow your doctors directions when taking oral steroids Light therapy People with very severe eczema may benefit from therapy using ultraviolet light Immunosupressants Medications that suppress the immune system may also be an option These medicines such as cyclosporine azathioprine  or methotrexate  may be used when other treatments have failed Immunomodulators  This newer type of medicated cream helps treat eczema by controlling inflammation and reducing the immune system reactions Examples include Elidel and Protopic  Heres the original article httpwwwwebmdcomskinproblemsandtreatmentseczemaunderstandingeczematreatment thank you very much for your input i have determined that it is jock itch and am getting a corticosteroid and some fungal cream as well Zanfel only helps if applied immediately afterthe exposure to Poison Ivy Depdending upon how soon you apply it the effects of poison ivy may range from nothing to mild rashes to something which remains for 35 days Look into an antifungal cream from a drug store If you did not bruise your foot then you dont have a bruise I had this on my back and found that it was a fungal rash that I had been treating It was that ever lurking athletes foot my daughter has had the same thing it sounds like it is a staph infection or impetigo which needs antibiotics orally and a speacial cream My 14 yr old daughter has the same thing  definitely shingles on her head where she had a total of 2 chicken pox as a 6 mos old the blisters are in clusters down the back of the left side of her head When you get to her body though she has the dew drop single chicken pox looking blisters It is as if she got shingles where she had the 2 original pox but has chicken pox on the rest of her body  both sides of torso effected front and back right side of face singly splattered NO pox at all though on the right side of her head SHE IS IN PAIN TOO I experienced something similar with my baby girl and the only thing that worked was this over the counter stuff called Domeboro It came in little packets that you just mix with water and soak their tush in It was the ONLY thing that would work and it helped immediately I think you may be able to find it at Walgreens It could possibly be Athletes foot I had it before and it burned itched and it would come and go I hope this helps have they been around anyone new recently do they have new or sudden fears of people and places they were normally comfortable with I have had the same problem and found i am allergic to grass I just take an over the counter allergy medicine I am not a doctor but I would assume that the rash is not from the Sudafed If I had to guess I would say that it is from a reaction to laundry detergent hand soap etc Does she have water blisters on her extremities primarily her fingers You best guess is just to take her to the doctor especially if she starts having issues breathing I hope this helps Get tested If you have had the chicken pox sounds like it could possibly be shingles Call your Md and make an appt It is hard to determine if it is shingles from your description Look up pictures and descriptions online and see if your symptoms are similar and it isnt necessary to see a doctor as you will know if you have shingles or not One of the better treatments that is cost efficient is llysine which is an amino acid and has been statistically proven to help reduce outbreak period Hope this helps It could be flea bites My daughter is allergic to fleas and it sounds similar Of course the thing you do not want to hear it could be soooo many other things poison oakivy scabies etc Domebro is a good itch reliever but does dry the skin You can buy it at most any store walmart bimart fred meyer etc it probably best to see a doctor about it I do know the top number is how fast the blood is going into your heart and the bottom number is the pressure on your heart between beats I was on bp meds because my bottom number got so high Yes I would say that you should get cream from Dr and wash all bedding cloths youve worn last 5 days in hot water and dryer Vacuum house Put comforters that you can not wash in garbage bag seal it and wait 7 days for all mites to die Its entirely possible to have multiple infections at the same time but your doctor is right antibiotics should clear any bacterial infections right up The sore throat is likely being caused by post nasal drip from your sinus infection If its strep you should see small white patches on your tonsils and its extremely painful If after you finish your round of antibiotics you still have a serious sore throat then you should go back to the doctor for more tests Good luck could be an allergic reaction to soap or laundry detergent try changing one or both  not sure it depends on what kind of rash it is you first need to deatermine what kind of rash it is but any anti itch cream should work at least for a lil and if it dont help at all u need to go to the doctor to make sure its just a simple rash as long as your not using it any more the rash should go away if its not gone by a week consult your doctor try not to iratate it and keep it dry sweating will iratate it and make it itch I have read many articles in the past that sometimes when a virus is leaving the body is does so in the form of a rash But if youre still in doubt just call your drs office and ask for the nurse The nurse should be able to advise you Shingles are not contagious However if you have not had chickenpox you may develop chickenpox after being exposed to shingles Only the drainage from the blisters can spread herpes zoster  which is the virus that causes shingles and chickenpox Once the blisters crust over they are no longer contagious and before blisters break out the virus cannot be spread If you have had the chickenpox the herpes zoster virus is already lying dormant in your system To put it in a nutshell one person with shingles CANNOT spread shingles to another person I have been a nurse for 25 years and cared for those with shingles numerous times It is because or the hair regrowing on your vaginal area You may try applying home remedies like paste from papayas or avocados These home remedies may take longer time to work but are definitely safer for your sensitive skin You may also look for hypoallergenic products that will not cause irritation to your skin The best thing that you have to do is to follow your doctor Things may go out fine after some time You may also check out httpwwwclearcliniccom for the best in skin care I am a paramedic and have dealt with something like that It turned out that the patient had changed deodorant and was allergic to a chemical in it If your son has swapped deodorants it is likely the case so have him stop use and take some benedryl for a couple days and should clear up Judging from your screen name as a diabetic you want to keep your hands clean cause you will not heal as quickly This is why your DRY hands wont heal as quickly I do not see your hands so I can not rule out a rash but I feel you may be confusing a rash with just general dryness Try some eucerin or cetaphil lotion its supposed to heal dry cracked skin Except some folks say it burns you may want to try to neutrogena skin therapy cream they have some serious stuff at the grocery store for dry skin go take a gander and see which bottle matches your hands The winter months make dry hands worse so keep inside and keep warm Yesit could  I would go to the dr and be checked for herpes I hate to tell you this but I only know cause I have them the dr told me 85  of people get it and dont even realize it  you can get it even wearing condoms it is the most sexually transmitted dieses out there  also can be contracted from someones mouth to genitals if they even have the being sign of a cold sore It could be from a plant or some kind of poison oak that you wernt aware of may be in your yard some bodys house or being out in the woods you have the same thing almost like I have going on with me but mine is on my right inner thigh itchy raised dry rash Im just using over the counter antiitch cream good luck Try hydrocortisone and good luck After a few months your body will become use to the med Then if the dosage goes up the painful burning rash will return but after a year your body gets use to the medicine and the awful rash wont return Also try Benadryl cream and pills The rash is a side effect I would suggest setting up an appointment with a dermatologist When I was diagnosed with eczema by my general physician I was prescribed Triamcinolone Acetonide which didnt do much It was later found out that I had psoriasis your description sounds similar to my symptoms and I was prescribed Clobetasol Propionate for two weeks followed by Triamcinolone Acetonide for 6 weeks or until the symptoms disappeared Im no doctor but I have a lot of experience with rashes as I have suffered from psoriasis for many years I would also suggest visiting an allergist as they would find out what is causing the flare ups Eczema is typically allergy related if Im not mistaken Lastly I would suggest cleaning all her laundry and bedsheets with sensitive skin detergent arm  hammer is great Is she allergic to any foods Maybe you could keep track of what she eats and see if you can pinpoint the flare ups to any particular food Like I said do not take my advise to heart only my suggestions as I am not a physician Hope I helped and good luck Rashes may burn at times due to the cause If you cut your leg in the same region of the rash before the rash showed up it could be an infection If you itched the rash it could cause burning if you cracked the skin Dry skin can also cause a warming sensation More information needed to give you a correct answer yes GO in My mom had shingles hers didnt spread You are pregnant your body is not your own anymore i went to the hospital thinking my water broke  no I just peed a little I was humiliated guess what the hospital was not they would rather me and my child were better off safe than sorry Please go in and good luck to you Shingles according to my mom are very painful Also hers were on her back  i saw it had no idea first and felt it it was warm thankfully i didnt get it but I went to the doctor as I was very early pregnant I also have Rosacea and had the same happen to me 2 years ago My MD treated me with multiple gels creams including a steroid cream to no avail He suggested I try OTC Lamasil for athletes foot It worked Steriod cream is probably going to be your best bet Look up common childhood skin problem here on WebMD you may find a picture that you can relate to Hope it goes away quickly So I see that some people insist poison ivy cannot return months later and others say it can And who is right Absolutely the people who say it can return are right Last summer I had poison ivy around my ankles Many months later in the winter a milder version of the rash returned I was not wearing the same clothes not sleeping on the same sheets and not touching anything I had used outdoors I was not working outdoors at all Moreover even now a year later though I dont have the rash around my ankles if I scratch my skin in that area the red bumps and the itching will return Currently I am recovering from poison ivy rash primarily on my face and neckunrelated to last years episode I have taken Prednizone for a week and never again will I take a stereoid No wonder all those NFL players are killing people I have washed all my clothes sheets etc in hot water twice The rash on my face has almost disappeared but I have little outbreaks here and there in odd places like a bump on my arm or on my back But I have not worked outdoors in more than 2 weeks The poison ivyas someone else saidis surely in my system I wish I could prove it so that people like me tormented by this vicious plant wouldnt look for answers and receive erroneous ones from socalled professionals What has worked better for me than anything is white vinegar It stings on the bumps and openings in the skin but the stinging is not worse than the itching I apply it liberally with drenched cottonballs until my skin is dripping and I wait for it to dry naturally Then I rub Itch all over the nowdry area There may be better methods but the vinegar dries it out makes thick scabs hideous but effective the scabs fall off fairly soon so thick they make a plopping sound when they fall ugh gross Ive been able to sleep with this method maybe having to get up once in the night to reapply the vinegar or just grope for the Itch and rub some inwhereas last year using other treatments I could not sleep Other treatmentsVicks VapoRub Clorox so good for your liver cortizone creams and other overthecounter meds have not done so well Havent tried tobacco but Im an xsmoker and if theres anything that makes me want to smoke its lying awake all night scratchingso I had to forget that A pox take the next creep who writes that the best treatment is avoidance I hope you get to dance to the tune of poison ivy at least once The plant is everywhere I hope this helps some other poor sufferer ItchyScratchy I have eczema on my arms but for some reason one of my eye lids gets extremely dry so I have to put cream on it I put Eucerin cream on my eczema and eye lid It seems to be safe to put near eyes because it is free of dyes and scent though Im not an expert so I could be wrong It hasnt completely cleared up my eczema but it is helping to keep it from getting worse and not itch so much So for right now Im going to continue using it and see if I can get it to clear up but if not Im going to see a doctor I have had shingles and I only had it around my upper back but I know it can apprear just about anywhere I would highly reccommend seeing a doctor because even though it can go away without antibiotics I believe it can also get worse and be very miserable It is up to you if it seems to be improving then maybe you dont need to but if its spreading then you definitely should see a doctor It can get pretty serious if left untreated I would not recommend going around someone who is pregnant even though shingles is spread through direct contact just because it can be very serious and it isnt something someone who is pregnant should be exposed to Is she on antibiotics Amoxicillan is an antibiotic that can cause rash Its not necessarily an allergic rash just a side effect Keep up with the ibuprofen no aspirin Keep her comfy and hydrated not with sugary drinks and juices which are sugary drinks Water is best if she is not eating try some of the drinks for children that replace electrolytes and have some vitamins If she has no fever is eating and drinking ok dont get too upset Assuming she has been vaccinated against all the nasty bugs if I were to be expering a blood clot in my knee to my thigh would the redness and painful away when Im sittingthank you Are you just interested on creams and drugs which are useful to cure your skin problem or else any other source which can cure it It is necessary to consult a dermatologist to judge on what type of rash you are suffering from and have to treat it But before that why cant you just try products which can cure your skin problem naturally Usage of products with natural ingredients can help you to recover from many type of skin problems Best you can have from online search are products made out of Argan nuts which might give positive results than other what does your dermatologist say about this or primary physician both need to be seen your physician needs to be alerted with this  especially if you happen to be diabetic or have history of circulatory problems drinking plenty of water is an awesome flusher to the system Rash will take another week to fully dissipate Hang in there Here is a great slide show from the site that might help you identify it i would have it checked for eczema try using eucerin or aquaphor and cortisone cream a couple times a day  Bland Diet While no specific diet is recommended for those diagnosed with HenochSchnlein purpura you can lessen gastrointestinal symptoms by adhering to a bland diet A bland diet can be as simple as refraining from eating any spicy foods to a more strict BRAT diet The BRAT diet consists of bananas rice applesauce and toast This combination is generally welltolerated by those with an upset stomach Liquids It is important to remain hydrated when suffering from HenochSchnlein purpura The condition normally clears up on its own over a period of weeks but during that time it is important to take in sufficient water sports drinks herbal teas and broth to remain hydrated Avoid milk soft drinks and caffeinated beverages which can increase dehydration Yes those symptoms may not be coincidental However you might need to wait a little longer to see if you are HIV positive Test results may be incorrect if youre tested too soon They have a test where they prick your finger just like a diabetes test Its completely painless and it takes 15 minutes They test for HIV antibodies and thats why you might need to wait a little longer to test If you have an outreach center near you they offer tests for free Also was the rash white Thats a common thing for HIV Flu symptoms are a common indicator Its certainly possible The best way is to see if that person you had an interaction with 100 is infected Bring himher to a test center Even if its negative heshe could still be a carrier Its scary but you can definitely get it under control If you feel extremely off and in danger visit the ER just in case its something else "}
