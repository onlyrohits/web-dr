{"text": "Hello MissChung Thats honestly hard to answer I am going to SPECULATE and say its a muscle or tendon or ligament there that may have been damagedtorn during the accident I think this because of how you said it feels soft at first then hard throughout the day and then can be massaged away If you only tore part of a tendonligamentmuscle it would knot up like you mentioned I recommend telling your physician the next time you go to the doctor because if my theory is correct you risk further injuring the area Better to fix it NOW than wait till youre crippled right Do you practice any kind of hair removal in the area If so an ingrown hair may have caused the formation of a cyst Whether you feel these lumps may be cancerous or common I highly advise you to see your physician and accordingly the doctor may or may not order additional testss However If the lump is painful and can be rolled around chances are it may be a cyst of some kind and can be easily treated I have a personal story I had a horribly painful lump in my armpit and was more than frightened about the diagnosis of cancer I did make an appointment with my physician and after a full examination of the area and an ultrasound it was found that the area was a severely ingrown hair and the area had to be lanced and drained Simple wound care was required for a couple of weeks following the procedure Evidently there is a large percentage of women who shave our underarms incorrectly There is a name for these women They are known as rakers A raker is someone that glides the razor over and around the underarm area in an irratic manner across the direction of hair growth against the direction of hair growth whatever gets the job done and it causes irritation or folliculitis inflammation of the hair follicle and even an ingrown hair which can become extremely sore and enlarged due to the inflammation The correct procedure for shaving your underarms is as follows Start with wetting the underarm area with lukewarm water apply shaving cream specific to the sensitive area of the underarm area and use a great quality razor either disposable or reusable NEVER A DULL RAZOR Always glide the razor WITH the direction of hair growth This is information that you can use all the time especially if those painful underarm lumps are diagnosed as being ingrown underarm hair This is not to replace a visit or an examination by your physician ALWAYS SEE YOUR PHYSICIAN FOR ANY ABNORMALITIES FOUND IN THE BREAST LYMPH NODES OR UNDERARMS THIS CAN NOT BE STRESSED TOO MANY TIMES  Your reaction to finding lump in your breast is completely understandable and normal I believe that your anxiety is really fear Anxiety and fear are interrelated conditions Anxiety causes fear and fear causes anxiety But there are differences Anxiety is a common emotion that is usually due to some vague feeling of apprehension without an obvious threat An example might be walking down a dark street alone at night and feeling afraid Fear on the other hand is an emotional response to a definite threat For example someone approaches you on that same dark street and says Stick them up Now you have a real threat and are justifiability fearful That lump in your breast was a real threat and must be considered as a legitimate fear Once that fear is totally removed your anxious feelings should subside Until you get a clean bill of health from your 2nd opinion physician please attempt to direct your focus on the results of your first opinion Enjoy life enjoy your family and have fun I hope that your wait to hear positive news this week is swift and that your emotional health is instantly restored I would not invest any time into worrying The growth as you describe in your question sounds like an enlarged axillary lymph node Just to be on the safe side I suggest that you show the node to your family doctor for their inspection and assessment especially since it is painful The most prevalent cause of such a growth is an infection that is being foughtoff by your body I hope that this answer has been helpful  A tumor is a growth Therefore a Lipoma is a tumor It is a growth composed of fat cells The vast majority of Lipoma tumors turn out to be benign and require no treatment The malignant counterpart to a Lipoma tumor is Liposarcoma and requires treatment Some patients and their doctors feel that all Lipoma tumors should be excised to ensure the tumors being benign through a pathological examination Other reasons for removal include aesthetics and possible intrusion on adjacent muscles and nerves I recommend that you have a surgeon familiar with Lipomas to confirm that the tumor is benign Most doctors can differentiate a begin Lipoma from a malignant Lipoma by simply palpating the growth I also recommend that at a minimum to have the growth biopsied You need to see a doctor immediately It sounds like you have a serious condition not sure what it could be but you should definitely be looked at as soon as possible Thats normal i guessmy small baby brother had several lumps on his head the doc said its because of his growth hormonesthyroid glands you may visit a doc to be certain I certainly hope you have been to see your doctor about this I just had my submandibular gland removed about 5 months ago It was quite enlarged and cusing me to cough all the time It was pressing on my throat I have been cured I also had a brown spot that occurred overnight last year on my face Thought I had been bitten by a spider in bed It wouldnt go away and then when I washed my face it would bleed So I went to a dermatologist had a biopsy and it was cancer I had it removed Never let any spot or mole bleed without you going immediately to your doctor Also watch out for a change in color on moles or spots   Closed head injuries are a major issue in sports particularly with children Concussion is what we call a closed head injury and managing patients both in the initial post injury period and the ensuing days to weeks can be challenging  As for post concussive symptoms headache concentration problems dizziness sleepiness and a whole bunch more are all symptoms that can be present For how long is very individual People need to be symptom free at rest before the begin resuming ANY exercise program or sporting activity This is even more important in kids as they are still developing their brains There are more and more docs now who specialize in both concussion management and helping getting people back to normal activity If your son is still symptomatic I would get him seen by a local sports medicine doc who is knowledgeable in concussion After months of antibiotics the wound continued until it became MRSA aka Folliculitis I feel it has become worse with lumps in the back of my neck The Hospital gave me the topical Mupirocin I will keep you informed There are mixed feelings on this medicine but from what I have heard it is not good to use since MS effects the nerves  There is a possibility of an exacerbation so I am NOT taking it  Ive had something similar in my mouth on the inside top of both my cheeks Ive always just figued they were extra flaps of skin as Im able to move them around with my tongue Ive had them for as long as I can remember and have never had any problems I would consult your doctor asap They may want to do a scope to look inside your throat for possible tumors What kind of pain is it Is it located in your throat itself or in the neck in general My wife felt a large lump in one of her breasts She went to the doctor and he examined her Since he felt several areas in ech breast that was questionable and since she has 34F breasts he took about 10 minutes examining each breast He had her get an ultrasound and a mammogram A number of cysts were found and she was put on a number of OTC meds The problem went away after 6 months Im sorry to hear youre going through this Painful knees are no fun This is something you should have evaluated by a health care provider You can start with your primary care provider While its possible you simply have some arthritis or some inflammation related to doing chores on your knees its also possible you injured your knee Your symptoms could be caused by a variety of knee injuries including a dislocated kneecap Ouch The mere fact that youre having severe inflammation shooting pains and burningstinging sensations indicate you need a physical examination by a health care professional He or she may want to order some tests such as Xray or MRI to help figure out whats going on I wish you all the best in getting bck on your feet literally It certainly warrants having a doctor check it out You could be dealing with a  a blood clot in the tissue that could compress a nerve or cause some other problem Not to be confused with deep venous thrombosis which is something different entirely You can start with a visit to your primary health care provider He or she may order an Xray or CT scan of your triceps to see if theres a hematoma hiding in the tissue of your arm If there is your doctor may wait to see if the body successfully cleans up the excess blood cells Otherwise a minor procedure may be required to remove the knot Usually these types of big bruises heal up with no treatment at all However given that youre still noticing a lump two months after the injury it doesnt hurt to have it checked out Wishing you well Mmm probably not If this gets bothersome in terms of pain or bleeding or blocking sinus drainage then Id definitely recommend you get it checked out by a physician If it persists for more than a few weeks you may also want to get it checked out Its rare to get cancer in that area though not unheard of but Id consider that a longshot More likely its a cyst or something similar to a zit As always if you find this lump worrisome make an appointment with your primary healthcare provider and have it looked at Take care First let me say good for you for noticing this lump Also youre very wellinformed for your age which will help you better manage your health and wellness Bravo Youre right that its not unusual for developing breasts to feel lumpy Youre also right that breast cancer is rare in your age group But you still should get that lump checked out For one thing youll have some peace of mind For another thing your health care provider can further educate you about what to expect as your breasts continue to develop I recommend you make an appointment soon with your primary care provider He or she can help you figure out whats going on here Best wishes to you Unfortunately its difficult to give you a good answer without being able to see the bump If youre talking about a lesion like a mole that is new or has changed color to blue and has become itchy you definitely should have it looked at The back of the thigh would be an unusual place for a skin cancer but not if you tanned regularly when you were younger If youre talking about a bruisetype lump that feels like its below the skin you might consider a waitandsee attitude It could actually be a bruise Or perhaps a hematoma I dont think the small lump represents a medical emergency But it wouldnt hurt to have your primary care provider or a dermatologist take a look at it just to be safe Wishing you well Im sorry to hear youre going through this Unfortunately its not possible to diagnose what this lump might be without doing a physical examination The good news is its unlikely this lump is a cancer Its possible the lump is a cyst a lipoma noncancerous fatty tumor or an umbilical hernia I urge you to make an appointment to see your primary care provider for an exam This will help set your mind at ease and your provider will be able to recommend a treatment if necessary Hope this helps Ouch So sorry to hear of your mishap While this certainly isnt an emergency situation you might want to make an appointment with your primary care provider to get your shin lump evaluated A couple of things could be going on here that may or may not need to be treated It wouldnt hurt to get your health care providers opinion It is possible to bruise a bone especially in areas like the shin where the bone isnt wellprotected by layers of muscle fat and skin Its possible to fracture or chip a bone by whacking it on a hard object too Its also possible with a very bad bruise for blood to collect and form a lump called a  Sometimes a health care provider will want to surgically drain or remove a hematoma so that it doesnt put pressure on a nerve or cause other problems At any rate since you still have a painful lump a month after injuring your shin its well worth the time to have a health care provider check it out and make sure its healing properly Good luck to you Im sorry youre experiencing this Its always concerning when something weird starts happening with our bodies Many conditions could cause the symptoms you describe come to mind but its impossible to diagnose a skin problem without seeing it in person I suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider or a dermatologist to get a proper diagnosis Its possible your skin lumps are easily treatable  or that they dont need treatment at all But only a health care provider can tell you for sure Best wishes Thanks for providing all the great background information If several different doctors have told you the blemish is a cyst then thats probably accurate A is a pocket of tissue thats filled with some type of fluid The type of fluid can vary depending on the type of cyst Some are filled with fatty acids while others contain pus It sounds like your cyst is located within the skin layer not in the breast tissue which is good news Skin cysts are very common and do tend to drain occasionally as youve described The fact the cyst has gotten bigger and changed color is a good reason to have a health care provider reevaluate this Its possible the cyst needs to be treated by having it drained or even removed Only your health care provider can say for sure Cysts are an annoyance but luckily theyre not a serious disease Good luck to you as you cope with this Its hard to say what this lump is so its good youre going to the doctor In the meantime I think I can set your mind at ease that this lump is not a medical emergency and probably isnt anything lifethreatening Many conditions can cause the type of lump you describe My best guess is youll discover this bump is a  which does indeed contain scar tissue These bumps often present as a hard lump under the skin that is discolored and sometimes tender to touch At any rate your health care provider will be able to diagnose this for you and recommend appropriate treatment Wishing you all the best Any time someone reports symptoms on just one side of the body unilaterally it raises a few red flags You could be describing something as simple as an inflamed lymph node or as complex as cancer Theres no way to tell without doing a physical examination I suggest you make an appointment with your primary health care provider to start with He or she will make an initial evaluation and diagnosis and then refer you to a specialist if necessary I dont want you to be alarmed about this Chances are these symptoms dont point to anything ominous But why not get checked out just to be safe Wishing you all the best Its impossible to say what this might be without performing a physical examination unfortunately There are many structures such as and  in the area you mention These could become swollen and painful or it could be something else entirely If this swelling doesnt clear up within a few days or if you start to run a fever it would be worth getting this checked out by a doctor Any time there is swelling on one side of the body but not the other you cant go wrong getting it checked That said just because youre experiencing unilateral swelling doesnt mean its anything serious Lymph nodes for example often become enlarged in one small area on a temporary basis and then return to normal size I hope this helps Im sorry youre experiencing this It must be pretty unpleasant Its difficult to tell whats causing the lump on your lip Neither a flu shot nor the Concerta should cause that to happen If the lump has spread or you experience a rash shortness of breath or difficulty breathing these could be signs of an allergic reaction You should get medical attention right away However if its just one lump that doesnt itch or spread then it may simply be a coincidence that you noticed it after you started the Concerta and got a flu shot If the bump doesnt get better soon Id suggest you make an appointment with your health care provider to have it looked at Hope this helps The key word in your question is benign Benign means noncancerous or not lifethreaning A is a benign tumor caused by excess formation of milkproducing glands in the breast Its possible for a fibroadenoma to continue getting larger as time goes on That doesnt mean it will suddenly turn cancerous You should ask your doctor how often to have this rechecked However once a year with your mammogram is probably sufficient If youre concerned about the lump in any way a quick call to the nurse at your doctors office might set your mind at ease Hope this helps If you feel you may be hypothyroid it wouldnt be a bad idea to get checked out If you do have  you should be treated for it Breast tenderness generally isnt considered a symptom of hypothyroidism but it can be a symptom of other hormonal changes or imbalances Some women complain of breast tenderness during perimenopause or  and they also discover they are hypothyroid at that time So it can appear as if the hypothyroidism and tender breasts are linked when they arent necessarily in a clinical sense Your best bet is to make an appointment for an evaluation by a health care provider particularly since you said you have a lump on or near your thyroid gland Hypothyroidism can be treated and the sooner you catch it the better Best to you Whenever a health situation seems to be moving toward worse instead of better on the spectrum I always advise people to contact their health care provider for followup That seems to be the case with you and the breastarmpit lumps Even if everything came back normal four months ago these new symptoms deserve to be evaluated If Im misunderstanding you and the lumps were present four months ago when you had the biopsy and aspiration you still deserve an explanation for whats causing the lumps Its not enough to tell a patient its nothing and send them away You have the right to know what these lumps are and they could be simply noncancerous fibrous tumors or even enlarged lymph nodes for several reasons to set your mind at ease to understand if you need to seek any kind of additional treatment for help managing the pain I would suggest you start again with your GP If these lumps are new he or she will want to evaluate them If the lumps existed before he or she needs to give you a better explanation of whats going on Wishing you well Im sorry to hear of your health woes can be nasty things to deal with I certainly hope youre under the care of a medical professional Both the lump below the jaw and the weight loss would concern me and Id suggest you visit your primary health care provider to find out whats going on A number of conditions can cause those symptoms so you need a diagnosis and possibly treatment Wishing you all the best Im sorry to hear youre going through this but Im glad youve already taken steps to get a diagnosis If youre experiencing a lot of pain you might consider putting in a call to your providers office to ask about getting some pain medicine prescribed to you You dont have to wait until your next visit for that Its good news that the lump isnt lifethreatening Many of the lumps and bumps that occur in the soft tissue of our bodies are simply or noncancerous If you have a cyst it could be red swollen and painful It also could ooze I am not trying to diagnose your problem here just providing information With luck your doctor will be able to drain or remove the lump and then the pain will go away Hope this helps First of all good for you for performing a  Its critically important to the early detection of cancer That said I dont want you to immediately assume you have  You do need to get those lumps checked out by a doctor though Id suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider as soon as possible Other conditions such as benign noncancerous cysts can cause lumps in the scrotum Your health care provider will be able to diagnose what those lumps are and get you appropriate treatment Wishing you all the best Well my best suggestion is to seek medical attention Under most circumstances its not a good idea to pop any lump or bump that comes up under the skin particularly if it doesnt have a visible head Its especially not a good idea to use a thumbtack to pop skin lumps Lancing boils and other skin lesions is better left to professionals Wihle youre waiting for an appointment with your primary care provider keep the hole clean by washing with plain soap and rinsing with water If youre not allergic to any medications you also can put an antibiotic ointment such as Neosporin or generic triple antibiotic ointment on the hole to help guard against infection If you develop a fever hot red swelling at the puncture site pain that gets worse instead of better or feeling like youre coming down with the flu you should go to an urgent care facility as these can be signs of an infection I wish you the best of luck with this Ouch Getting a tat is painful enough without then experiencing a hard lump underneath it Id suggest you see a health care provider about this Its possible the lump is scar tissue formation but its impossible to tell without a physical exam are a known complication of tattooing but these generally are smaller bumps in the skin If the tattoo ink is placed too deeply in the skin it can cause scar formation Your tattoo also may appear raised Again its impossible to know whats going on without having a health care provider perform an exam At the very least getting a professional opinion will help set your mind at ease Hope this helps Sorry to hear about this Its hard to tell whats going on here without doing a physical examination Depending on the size of the wound that lump could be a normal part of the healing process Or it could be an infection or hematoma collection of blood in the tissue If your brotherinlaw develops a fever over 101F as measured by a thermometer not just by feeling a forehead or guessing he should get checked out by a medical professional as this may be a sign of an infection developing Also if the wound continues to swell turns hot to the touch or oozes a green foulsmelling discharge those would all be reasons to head for urgent care Im wondering if your brotherinlaw is uptodate on his shot Every adult needs a booster injection every 10 years If your brotherinlaw doesnt know if his tetanus immunization is current he should be alert for that could develop within 2 weeks of this accident including Headache Trouble opening his mouth lockjaw Trouble swallowing Stiff neck back and shoulders Again Im sorry to hear about this accident Its a good reminder to be careful using sharp objects and also for everyone to keep their tetanus shot current Im not sure what that is but it sounds very unpleasant Id suggest you see a dentist for an examination The bump youre describing could be anything from a skin ulcer to an to an  A dentist can evaluate the situation and tell you what youre dealing with He or she also will either provide appropriate treatment or refer you for medical treatment I wish I could offer you something more specific but unfortunately its not possible to diagnose your problem without a physical exam I wish you the best of luck Im sorry to hear youre going through this The fear of having cancer must be very tough for you to cope with Im glad to hear you have a mammogram scheduled That is a good starting point and it sounds like your health care provider is on top of your situation While you wait try to remember that worrying will only cause you misery and can even have a negative impact on your immune system Look for support from family and friends Try to distract yourself Focus on the many positive things in your life no matter how small they may seem If you can try to get a massage or otherwise pamper yourself to relieve your excessive stress Even though you have a family history of cancer its not a sure bet you have cancer too Its entirely possible your breast lump is benign noncancerous and that your other symptoms can be attributed to a virus or even stress I know its hard but try to work on reducing your stress level and staying as healthy as possible as you work through the process of getting a diagnosis Take care of yourself I have similar issues with my right knee too but not to the extent that you have If you are talking about your daughter she may be beginning puberty Most girls begin puberty between ages 8 and 13 The breast having small lumps that are tender are sometimes the first signs of puberty Sometimes one breast may become bigger than the other This is usually followed by a growth spurt 12 years later If the breast is red really hurts has discharge or any other symptoms speak to your doctor If you think your child is starting puberty this is a good time to talk to her about the changes that will be coming in the next few years I went to doctor today for the same thing and was told it is a cist at the top of the thyroid and if it gets large it will need to be removed You need to go get checked out this could be very serious Have you mentioned this to your doctor You should mention it to them Sounds like a possible STD I would say go see your gyno asap If you shave your armpits it could be from that Your husband would need to be examined before a diagnosis could be made That said I found an article that has some general info about lumps and bumps that may be found on the body httpwwwwebmdcomskinproblemsandtreatmentsguidecystslumpsbumps You could have an hernia I would have it checked out by your physician Do you feel like its on the ligament itself or somewhere on the bone I had a similar incident and when it was xrayed it came up as an abnormality BUT they sent for CT scan and found that it was calcium build up When you injure a part of your body blood flows to that area and calcium tends to build up at the site Thanks for answering Physical Examination A manual examination of the breast is an important screening method for detecting cancer and is the first step in the evaluation of a breast lump Unfortunately the manual examination of the breast is not perfect However if a mass can be felt manually it is important to estimate the location of the mass so that the mammogram andor other diagnostic examinations can focus on the particular area A doctor also inspects any suspicious skin changes that may be a sign of breast cancer Since the manual examination can miss breast cancer mammography is also important as a screening tool Mammogram Women with a breast lump need to have a mammogram of both breasts A mammogram is estimated to be able to detect about 90 of breast cancers This means that about 10 of breast cancers are missed by mammography Therefore if a woman or her physician feels a lump and the mammogram is normal further studies or biopsies are carried out to rule out cancer Sometimes a certain pattern of calcium deposits appears on the mammogram that makes the doctor suspicious of cancer In these cases it is often recommended that a biopsy be taken that is guided by a mammography technician to be sure the correct area is sampled Ultrasound Ultrasound is useful in the evaluation of breast lumps It can distinguish between a cyst such as a benign cyst which is filled with fluid and a solid lump which may or may not be cancerous The first step in the evaluation of a breast lump is to determine whether it is a cyst or solid mass and this is what an ultrasound can do best Especially in young women in whom a benign cyst may be suspected if the womans ultrasound confirms a typical cyst she may not require any procedures or biopsies If it is unclear on the ultrasound whether the lump is completely a cyst a further evaluation is usually recommended MRI Magnetic resonance imaging is becoming more widely used in the evaluation of breast lumps MRI is a special radiology technique designed to image internal structures of the body using magnetism radio waves and a computer to produce the images of body structures Cancers require a greater blood supply than noncancerous growths and the images obtained from an MRI may help determine whether a particular area is cancerous because the MRI shows greater contrast in those areas with an increased blood supply In most cases MRI is performed if results of mammography and ultrasound evaluations are not conclusive MRI also has limitations For example MRI cannot detect the presence of calcium deposits which can be identified by mammography and may be a sign of cancer Possibly hypothyroid Look up conditions on here and see if they relate That would be my best guess without knowing more It can make you feel really bad if left untreated Its not uncommon to get a lump in the area where youve had a shot It should go away in a few days If not have your doctor check it out In the meantime you can put a cold compress on it such as a bag of ice to help with the swelling Could be CDiff go the ER now Hi Has your wife by any chance changed her washing powder brand lately you may be getting a reaction to if try buying and wearing some new

have abcessesnot sebaceous cysts An abcess abscess starts out small red and hard It may have little to no discomfort but after a while it may get larger harder and more painful When you squeeze and mess around with it youre spreading staph bacteria around and youre only inflaming it more DONT DO THAT As soon as you see an abcess abscess either apply witch hazel or try a sulfurbased drawing salve KEEP THE AREA CLEAN No matter how clean you are staph bacteria resides on your skin Try keeping it as clean as possible with soap and water and dry thoroughly If you intend on using witch hazel or drawing salve put some on a sterile pad first aid pad and put it on the area By doing this youre not only putting the ointment on but youre keeping the area clean Change it when you use the restroom but be sure to follow the instructions on the drawing salve Most say 12 times per day The drawing salve actually breaks down the skin over the abcess abscess until it eventually ruptures on its own Yes its gross Light yellowbeige looking pus may ooze out with a combination of blood as well DO NOT TOUCH IT WITH YOUR HAND Use a clean sterile pad to blot it and place the pad over top of it to keep any outside bacteria from entering and spreading through your system Wash your hands with antibacterial soap thoroughly before and after each bandage change Keep the area clean I cannot emphasize this enough DO NOT try to squeeze it or get any more pus out of it  leave it alone If you dont leave it alone you may find yourself heading to the doctors to have HIM lance it and you dont want that Lidocaine is injected around the area and then the abcess abscess is lanced You think thats bad The doctor then goes in with special forceps and breaks apart the bacterial abcess abscess  this is painful as the lidocaine cannot numb this area The doctor will probably pack it with sterile water dressing and cover it He will prescribe you with antibiotics and you would have to come back three days later for a dressing change SO DO NOT POP IT DO NOT SQUEEZE IT LET IT DRAIN ON ITS OWN by following the directions above I am not a medical doctor but I do have medical training So Hope this helps you Good Luck Hi For your nipple bumps I think you find that your just normal Unless you have been have unprotected sex and not on any kind of BC See This link

condition to improve Based on your medical evaluation your doctor will determine whether your nipple discharge is normal physiologic or abnormal pathologic Even if your doctor determines your breast discharge is abnormal keep in mind that most pathological conditions that cause nipple discharge are not serious and are easily treated But I would see your doctor if your still worried but as they say try not squeezing them for a couple of weeks unless this is just a natural occurrence then thats just you You may need some extra nipple covers to soak it up but as you get older it may just stop on its own Hope you find this helpful Good Luck Hi See Answer above Hi If your friend has man boobs then yes he can have a tumor so get and help him ASAP Good Luck Hi Get to an ER you may need an xray

can grow for a variety of reasons Benign tumours are not caused by cancer Tumours caused by cancer are called malignant or cancerous While the underlying causes for tumour growth can vary the process by which they grow is the same Normally cells in your body will naturally refresh themselves by dividing This allows for dead cells to be disposed of naturally In the case of tumours dead cells may remain behind and form a growth known as a tumour Cancer cells grow in this way as well however unlike the cells in benign tumours they also invade nearby tissue Outofcontrol growth of abnormal cells causes damage to these adjacent tissues and organs and can lead to cancerous tumours in other parts of the body I do hope this helps you Good Luck Hi Your doctor would be best as its a visual thing

food allergies although thats not always the case You should slowly try to introduce this back into your diet in VERY small amounts If you dont seem to have any problems then you shouldnt have anything to worry about If you want to be sure then you can see your doctor again to have another round of allergy tests it could be a ganglionic cyst or a hematoma Noa lump in this area is not normal You will need to see your medical provider for an examination to determine exactly what it is there are MANY possibilities There is no way to blindly make that call over the Internet Who are you dating Hannibal Lector Yes a bit can cause a deep bruise called a hematoma and this can form a lump for a while It should eventually go away as you body reabsorbs the blood in this tissueand if your boyfriend bites you again HE should go away First it is not possible to make an accurate diagnosis based solely on a vague description A medical provider would have to physically examine you Second before addressing treatmentsurgical removal or otherwiseone must have that definitive diagnosis Third I would NEVER recommend that anyone attempt to do surgery on their penis at home It is bad enough just getting a zipper injury See a urologist You have had this worrisome and undiagnosed penis lump for a few years so how much longer are you going to delay doing this As you know health experts on this site have absolutely no way of looking at your eye across the Internet so you are getting a blind guess A red painful eye could be conjunctivitis pink eye assuming you did not have any traumainjury to the eye Viruses and bacteria are the main culprits and treatment is usually with prescription antibiotic eye drops A small yellow lump on your sclera as you call it may be a harmless pterigium I hope I spelled that correctly Look up this common eye disorder on the Internet or on WebMD to see if you can find a picture Get a second opinion from another urologist A prostate biopsy is not a pleasant procedure so it should only be done if absolutely necessary His PSA is fine but the PSA is not the definitive marker I dont know his age or risk factors but if his prostate examination is normalhis PSA is normalI am puzzled by the recommendation The urologist has a responsibility to justify this procedure so have a facetoface consultation and hear has rationale Why arent you wearing wrestling head gear that is designed to PROTECT your ears Yes you may have a hematoma  an accumulation of blood in the pinnae outer ear Unless this hematoma is properly drained and managed it may turn into a cauliflower ear  a terrible and preventable cosmetic deformity You need to get this checked out immediately It would be best to see an ENT specialist but any primary care medical provider should be able to help you Take this problem VERY SERIOUSLY my young friend Inform your parents and get that ear properly examined as soon as you can I have no idea A diagnosis requires an examination  not something that is possible over the Internet Dont be embarrassed See a medical professional female if you prefer so you can have this sensitive area properly examined You are correct It would be highly unusual never seen it in fact for a 14 year old to have a breast cancer so the most logical lump for you to have would be a cyst Some can be very firm fibrocystic mass and many will seem to change in size around your menstrual period It would be best to have any lump or mass properly examined so a visit to your primary care medical provider is indicated You are to be complimented for being aware of these changes She most likely has a hematomaan accumulation or pocket of blood under the skin This is just a guess however since I have no way of seeing or examining your daughter over the Internet She would need to see a medical provider for a handson examination to confirm this assumption In the meantime keep up with the cold compresses As you know I have no way of seeing or examining youI have only your description to go on One possibility would be a  perhaps a cyst that is secondarily infected These oil gland cysts are quite common in this area but you will need to see a medical provider so that you can be properly examined and treated You have had this for a month so it would be in your best interest to check in checked out so you will not have to worry You need to see a medical provider so you can be properly examined and treated which may involve lancing this lump depending on what it is This could be a thrombosed hemorrhoid a cyst abscess or  You will need to see a medical provider so that you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated There is really no way to blindly make a determination about your concerns over the Internet I am sorry Keep in mind that not all of your symptoms need to be linked to one universal cause Fatigue sore throat for a month Think mononucleosis Your doctor can order a sensitive EBV panel not the lesssensitive mono spot test Lump in breast in a 17 year old male I assume This is most likely adolescent gynecomastia You can look this up on the Internet This is quite common and related to hormones but it may NOT go away in a few months It can last longer You will need to see a medical provider so that you can be properly examined  not something that can be accomplished over the Internet Once you are diagnosed the medical provider will be able to determine the best course of treatment for you Your description is really not sufficient for me to even make a wild guess I dont know your babys age or the location of these lumps and obviously I have no way of feelingexamining them to give you a definitive answer Any chance that they are related to the vaccine administrations on the upper thigh area Children often bleed a tiny bit under the skin from the injection This area can form a tiny innocent lump that can take a while to selfresolve As much as I would like to help you with your diagnostic dilemma it is not possible to blindly determine the nature of yoru hand lumpblisters based solely on a description This requires a handson medical examination  obviously not something that can be accomplished over the Internet There is really a high probability that this is an infection one that may require antibiotics so I would suggest that you seek medical evaluation as soon as you can I dont knowI cant SEE it or EXAMINE you to be able to offer you a definite answer It could be a sebaceous cyst a localized skin infection or even a reactive preauricular lymph node You will need to physically see a medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated Since this lump is painful and tender I would suggest that you do this as soon as possible This is the location of the inguinal lymph nodes however it will take an examination to confirm this Lymph nodes can react enlarge or become tender in response to infections or inflammation in their local neighborhood There are other causes of lumps like sebaceous cysts lipomas etc so I encourage you to get it checked out I would not suggest that you squeeze undiagnosed skin lesions Unfortunately it is not possible to make a blind assumption as to the nature of this lump based solely on your description so you will need to see your medical provider or a dermatotogist for a proper examination You realize that I have absolutely no way of seeing or examining this eyelid lump In order for you to get an accurate diagnosisnot an blind guess you will need to see your medical provider optometrist or an eye physician It may be a hordeolum but there are dozens of other possibilities You need a diagnosis firstnot something that I can provide for you blindly over the Internet Unless the true nature of this hard lump is known and the reason for your night fevers they do not have to be related there is really no way for me or any medical professional for that matter to know if you need an antibiotic let alone a specific antibiotic without an examination Your first and most important step is to be properly examined and diagnosed I would suggest that you NOT selftreat this lump with clindamycin since this may interfere with a culture if your doctor feels this is needed No if these lumps are chalazions they are not contagious They still could be hordeolum internum stys under the eyelids so please have them examined so that you can have an exact diagnosis and treatment solution Although I cannot see your scar first hand as a wound heals it may produce more scarring tissue This can often dissipate in about a year In some cases the scar tissue can become quite prominent forming a keloid If you are concerned about the current appearance of your scar you will need to see a medical provider to examine it firsthand You will need to have this hard fixed lump properly examined An axillary lymph node is certainly a possibility and hard fixed nodes are concerning Sebaceous cysts can also mimic nodes Obviously I cannot examine you son but he most likely has ADOLESCENT GYNECOMASTIAa hormonal sideeffect of good ol puberty Yes these can be tender Ibuprofen may help and obviously he should avoid trauma to this area or trauma from teasing brothersfriends who like to pinch them or give him a painful twister or purple nurple Ask you son and he will explain what this isThese things can add to the normal discomfort of course Research adolescent gynecomastia on the internet If you are concerned you can see his regular medical provider for a consultation The thyroid is not under your chinit is in your neck Unfortunately since i cant see those lumpsfeel those lumpsI cannot blindly determine their nature based solely on your vague description If those lumps are shallow and moveable under your skin and you feel they are related to your acne they could be acne cysts You would need to see your medical provider or a dermatologist to be sure Every person is different so without a handson examination it is really difficult if not impossible to offer you a patientspecific answer The lump could be many thingsfrom a sebaceous cyst to a reactive lymph node Instead of worrying about cancer see your medical provider so you can have a definitive answer not a blind guess or list of possibilities I have to say that I have no heard of this disorder Eczema is a dry SKIN condition atopic dermatitis an the eyeball has no skin Your medical provider may be using this term to make an explanation easier to understand but it certainly confuses me See another ophthalmologist for a second opinion or at least get this one to give you the medical name for his condition Is it possible your husband misunderstood the name Sodium chloride drops are salt water See your medical provider so you can have these painful lumps properly evaluatednot something that can be done blindly online I can help you with advice but unfortunately a brief description is not sufficient to be able to offer you a definite answer as to the nature of your breast lump You will need to see your medical provider for a careful examination and perhaps some imaging studies Many lumps on younger women are cysts but this important call cannot be made blindlyyou MUST have a proper examination There could be several different reasons to have a mass in your scrotum Some of the more common reasons could be an i or a  I am not sure what type of cyst that you had removed four years ago but it is time for you to see your urologist again to have this new lump properly examined diagnosed and treated It may just be an innocent skin tag quite common but unfortunately this would require an examination to confirm A description is really not sufficient to make a blind diagnosis Next time ask your medical professional during an examination in this area His pediatrician or pediatric urologist will need to examine him It is not possible to offer you a definitive answer based solely on your description Yes it could be an inguinal hernia or a hydrocele A torsion twisting is also possible but these are very painful and quite seriousI suspect he would be in obvious pain if this is happening but torsions can occur and quickly detorse in some children Either way an examine will be required to make that important determination If he is in pain due to this swelling or if the swelling is becoming larger an emergency room visit is warranted and an scrotal ultrasound is usually ordered to help make the diagnosis Normal No but it can happen Keep in mind that this eyelid lump may not be a sty hordeolum at all There are other lesions like a  that can be present for a long long time At some point you may want to see a ophthalmologist so you can have this lump properly examined diagnosed and treated Your husband needs to see a medical provider so these lumps possibly reactive lymph nodes or  can be properly examined diagnosed and treated It would not be possible to determine the true nature of them blindly over the Internet based solely on the brief information in your posting Men are stubborn and I suspect your husband is no different Make the appointment for him and take him even if he is kicking and complaining the entire way This is really the ONLY way to get these lumps properly assessed I cant answer that question since I would need to know what it actually was I cannot make a blind guess and determine if it will go away I am very sorry There are MANY things that cause intrascotal masses A brief description of the size and location does not really substitute for a thorough examination I realize that money may be tight and that you do not have insurance but there are really no alternatives You will need to make a decision based on how concerned you are about this new finding Give your husband the same consideration as your automobile If your car was causing problems or making a strange noise you would get it checked out before it became worse Unless a medical provider could examine you firsthand and take a detailed medical history it would not be prudent to make a blind guess over the Internet as to what this lump might be A picture is not helpful unfortunately A medical provider would need to carefully examine not only this lump of concern but examine the entire area from the neck up It could be a lymph node cyst or yes it could be a sign of a serious mass  one that may need to be imaged CT or MRI or perhaps even biopsied You cannot make this determination from a photo or a vague description You are the trustee of your body It is your responsibility to take this seriously and be properly examined Stop doing home surgery on your penis lumps before you get a secondary infection Since I cant examine you firsthand there is really no way for me to confirm or dispute the sebaceous cyst diagnosis so I would suggest that you see your primary care medical provider or a urologist for an expert opinion Cysts tend to be filled with a cheesy material unless of course they are calcified which may be the case for you It could be a cyst but there are other possibilities You would need to see your medical provider so you can have this lump properly examined and diagnosed Unless a dentist removed your wisdom teeth you can still have them but there can be other reasons to account for your symptomssuch as an abscess or infection or a reactive lymph node Please see your medical provider or dentist so that you can be properly examined and diagnosed Sohow long are you going to tolerate this before you see a medical provider have a proper examination and get this treated This still may be a pilonidal cystabscess or even a perirectal abscessa guess of course since I cant examine you Either way you need to have this treated and most likely will need a minor surgical procedure Just give it a rest my friend It is not likely that you cause testicular damage from overlymasturbating but you can cause enough trauma to have discomfort If your symptoms persist you will need to see your medical provider but I suspect a few days of rest and recuperation will give our overworked boys time to completely recover I dont knowI cant see them Your description of red bumps is way too vague for me to even guess A medical provider would need to examine you firsthand to offer you a definitive answer He may have adolescent gynecomastia  an unwelcomed hormonal gift associate with puberty This is relatively common but an embarrassment to boys Dont get me wrongteen boys admire breasts but they dont want to grow their own You can find lots of information about this temporary condition on the Internet so you both can read it This condition can last about two years and can involve both breasts not just one There is nothing medically that can be done to stop it and nearly all will eventually resolve I have seen thousands in my practice and only one had to have surgery to remove this breast tissue If he doesnt want to take off his shirt at home or wear one at the pool let him Dont let other siblings or friends tease him either  I have no way of seeing or examining your scrotal lumpbump in order to properly diagnose you let alone blindly offer you treatment advise This is not something that can be accomplished online so I would strongly suggest that you see your medical provider Yes you most definitely need to see your doctor so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated It would be impossible to determine the nature and significance of this lump based solely on a brief description Not without having the ability to see and examine this bumpyour description is just too vague to make a guess as to what it might be It is NOT normal to continue to have ear pain five months after tube grommet insertion so I would suggest that you try and get a second opinion from another ENTsince two ENT heads are better than one The area behind the ear is the mastoid sinus but postauricular lymph nodes can also be painful Obviously ruling out mastoiditis  a complication of chronic middle ear infections  would be very important The leakage otorrhea is likely the drainage of fluid through the grommets from the middle ear space If the ENTs are not helping you can ask your dentist for a referral to an ORAL SURGEON As much as I would like to address your concerns I really do not know anything about youyour age medical history or even if you are a female men have breasts too More importantly it would take a thorough examination to determine if this lump is worrisome or not Although I am sympathetic to your lack of insurance an examination is really the only way to make this important call I can tell you that lumps that come and go are more likely to be cysts especially if the lumps are influenced by your menstrual cycle again assuming you are female Breast cancers do not come and gosadly they tend to stay and get bigger over time No doctors are not obligated do do what you wantlike a biopsy that they feel may be unnecessary Your only course of action is to see a different surgeon plead your case and get a second opinion Surgeons do not want to just randomly remove or biopsy masses that may be cystic fibrocystic or clearly not suspicious of cancer You have a cancer fear since these are your breaststhe only ones that you feel The surgeon may have years of experience examining thousands of lumpy breasts and reading many mammograms and does not share in your fear or concern You cannot force a surgeon into the operating room no matter how much you demand Try and get your old records to confirm that diagnosisincluding the pathology report To get a breast CANCER at age 13 is extremely rare so I would question the validity of that diagnosis Drained Probably not It would be wise to be examined by your medical provider so this lump can be properly diagnosed and treated You could have a spermatocele and accumulation of sperm in the epididymis These may come and go Lesscommon would be epididymitis but this should be painful Next time the lump appears make sure to have it examined while it is still there I make it a personal rule not to look at these photos since a picture is never the same as a direct medical examination Common perianal lumps would likely be hemorrhoids or anal skin tags Other skin lesions like warts can also mysteriously appear in this sensitive area All have the tendency to bleed when irritated from bowel movements or wiping If you really want a definitive answer you to forego modesty and embarrassment and be properly examined by a medical professional To seasoned clinicians looking at your butt is no big deal No medical professional could make an accurate assessmentdiagnosis based solely on a vague description Your son needs to have this lump carefully examined by a medical professional It could be many different thingsa sebaceous cyst a reactive postoccipital lymph nodeor  Please encourage him to do the right thing and have it properly examined and diagnosed You will need to see your health care provider or gynecologist for a proper examination to determine the true nature of this lump Your description is just too vague for me to be able to narrow down the several possibilities but one common lump could be a Bartholin gland cyst  You can do a little research to see if that fits the bill The fact that this lump is bigger and more painful emphasizes the importance of medical intervention If her breasts become soretender with her menses having them squeezed to the size of pancake during a mammogram may not be pleasant Have her call the mammogram technician for advice Her period should not affect the accuracy of the test but it can affect her comfort You have had a penile fracture and there is a significant chance you will develop scarring and curvature at that point For men with fresh penile fracture we tell them no sex of any kind for 2 to 3 weeks at a minimum You should see a urologist soon For severe fractures with severe pain swelling and extensive bruising we often fix those surgically if we see the man right after it happens If there is a delay or it is not severe we often manage conservatively could you possible be pregnant I didnt know how to edit my question sorry but I have included a picture of the bruising there is a medium sized bruise and under the skin I can feel a lump that sends a weird feelingpain down my arm towards my wrist when touched Picture httpimg826imageshackusimg8266942img00000012jpg I have been applying ice on it here and there and it seems to feel better but I am worried I might have a clot  Yes it does actually Here is some information on that I hope will help you determine whether you need immediate medical attention If you have any signs of concussion please give your doctor a call or visit your nearest emergency room The WebMD Answers Staff my wife fell and hit her head she seems ok  no disorientation  knows the days of the week  can count forward and backward do you think I should take her to emergency I would go to the hospital immediately You probably had an allergic reaction It will be better if you see a doctor so you can have a clear understanding about the skin condition that you are in right now You may also visit httpwwwclearcliniccom for great ideas on skin care Yes There are so many types of scars and most do move over time You said it was on the arch of your foot Scars Atrophic scars These scars are sunken down into the skin This type of scarring is often seen with acne scars or with wounds where skin or muscle is removed by an injury This type of scarring can also happen when the body produces so much scar tissue in one area that it prevents new cells from growing where the wound took place Hypertrophic scars These are usually red or purple and are slightly raised above the skin They tend to fade and get flat over time Contracture scars These types of scars often happen with burns and end up pulling the skin in towards the site of the injury This can make the skin look puckered around the wound Keloid scars These are very elevated red or dark scars that form when the body produces a lot of extra collagen in a scar Keloid scars are actually a benign type of tumor and often grow bigger than the area of the original injury Stretch marks Also called striae these are considered a unique type of scar since they dont happen in response to an injury but because of the skin being stretched rapidly often during pregnancy or adolescence The tissue here is often sunken a little into the skin and tends to fade with time So you may fit inton one of these catagories but do not worry If you tend to feel pain please consult with you doctor httpwwwwisegeekcomwhatisscartissuehtm This could be cyst to have them in the wrist area is common I believe it is a ganglion cyst I would make an appointment with the doctor to make sure They are correct it more than likely is a cyst I would make a doctors appointment to have it checked out  When working you tend to aggravate it causing it to swell and fill with fluid  It is definitely possible My fianc had a colostomy removal of a section of intestines due to diverticulitis It was reversed in April 2013 About 2 months later he found out his whole entire belly area had herniated The doctor told him it was due to a weakening of the abdominal muscles from having his stomach opened twice He had massive hernia surgery December 2013 The doctor had to use mesh to help hold the hernia My fianc noticed a few months ago he now has another hernia a lump the size of a baseball under where the other hernia surgery was performed So unfortunately it sounds like you have a hernia Please have yourself checked The procedure to be checked is painless The doctor did an ultrasound and CT scan to see the hernia I know from personal experience the PSA is a very questionable test designed to promote more tests and more expenses by the male populace My PSA is 1049 I have acute bacterial prostitus This is treatable with powerful antibiotics If you still have fear thats what they want Then by all means have the Dr order a CAT scan and then you will know the truth J Ben I dont know a lot about testicular pain  but I found an article that might be helpful Sounds like if its been going on for 2 years off and on you might want to get it checked out httpwwwemedicinehealthcomtesticularpainpage2emhtmtesticularpaincauses i really hope this helps Oh sweetie please dont think the worst It could be an assortment of things including cysts or noncancerous tumors  even an infected ingrown hair But the only way to know for sure is go to a doctor If it is that small no matter what it is it may not be a problem as it would be simple to remove Just dont let it grow before doing anything about it The small yellowish lump is what is probably whats causing your eye to be red and hurt Men can also get breast cancer In all likelihood it could be a group of muscles that is bunched up or a calcium deposit that will work itself out HOWEVER it could be something as severe as a blood clot or cancer cell cyst type of thing I would definitely not let it sit considering the rate of growth Schedule an appointment with your doctor if it is not gone in twenty four hours or so If it grows much bigger than that DEFINITELY seek medical attention i have two compressed fractures confirmed from MRI and Neruosrgeionspine I can after weeks short walk and mostly bed rest use a cane I highly recommend you ask your doctor and your body will tell you major pain at least for me Update from original post Saw ENT had biopsy done and CT scan Biopsy was negative for Cancer Swelling by ear is gone and one in neck is somewhat smaller The ENT wants me to have the lymph node neck removed and biopsied Im not in good health have intractable facial nerve pain from dental procedure going thru nerve blocks for that among other conditions I want to wait on removing the lymph node as none of the tests showed a definitive problem Need some adviceprobably will ask for a second opinion My PCP is concerned as no sore throat or ear or obvious signs of infectionand swelling the same after 10 days on antibiotic clindamycin Had blood work done a Chest XRay and an ultrasound of the node by ear and in neckplus a referral to an ENT I dont think it has to hurt to be cancerous Most signs of cancer are not painful and sometimes go undetected until its far along or discovered by accident what do they look like size Round or irregular shape what color How did they go away before I happen to be a thirteen year old girl who has gone through the beginning of puberty over two years ago Tenderness was definitely a side effect from puberty for me but not every girl goes through the same puberty experiences The lump under the nipple is definitely normal its what will grow to be the fat in every breast As she goes through puberty that lump will grow and will eventually become the breast Cancer is painless conditionSo only we miss early stageAny lump painless at armpit can be associated with early breast cancerImmediately you must have biopsy done IF it hurts or painful it must be local infectionConsult your family doctorhave treatment with proper antibiotics My PSA was 68 and had 2 biopsies no bumps no cancer but because my doctor did not like the signs he did a  saturation biopsy which then showed I had a GLEASON SCALE OF T8 which at that point it starts SPREADING TO THE BONEY STRUCTURES AND LYMPH GLANDS  The simple biopsy only hits a small part of the Prostate Had he not been persistent and dependent upon my PSA I would be planning my funeral TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY Those who belittle the PSA should have their tongues cut out If you have had the chicken pox sounds like it could possibly be shingles Call your Md and make an appt You should really see your family physician 10 When Should I Call the Doctor About Digestive Problems You should call your health care provider if you have any of the following digestive symptoms Heartburn that persists andor becomes more severe or is not relieved by medication A sensation of food caught in the chest or throat Unusual or persistent abdominal pain Discomfort that interferes with daily activities Difficult or painful swallowing Heartburn that causes vomiting Vomiting of blood Bloody or black stools Dramatic weight loss Persistent hoarseness andor a sore throat Episodes of choking Persistent diarrhea New or persistent constipation if its behind your ear where the bottom of the skull is it is most likely a lymph node  some are more pronounced then others and can become inflamed if your body is fighting an infection sounds like swollen lympnoids sign of infection I also get these from time to time Typically one lump under one armpit That said I assumed it was an ingrown hair or some type of irritation from deodorant I ignored these lumps as they were few and far between I also researched the lumps and found that when painful they typically are not serious I noticed online that people suggested draining the lump themselves poking with a needle popping like a zit etc I do not think this is smart whatsoever You will only cause additional irritation One thing I have not seen as a suggestion to ease the pain and draw the lump out of the skin is epsom salt I use a warm compress of water and epsom salt when I get these lumps I do this a few times a day and leave the warm rag under my arm for roughly ten minutes each time This method works The fluid in the lump will draw out and the lump will rupture without poking If there is a deep lump then you have to let nature take its course and let it rise to the surface somewhat on its own but the epsom salt speeds this process along I thought of this method because growing up my mom used epsom salt to draw out slivers or a stinger I am shocked that no one has mentioned this online but thought Id share in hopes it will help someone With one deep lump I had I used the epsom salt compress on and off for about 3 days and on the 3rd day applied GENTLE pressure with the soft parts of my fingers and viola the lump popped and the pain subsided Btw it was grossLOL As for a new experience with lumps that I am currently having I have multiple painful lumps under BOTH sides of my armpits Obviously this is not an ingrown hair I have also been extremely tired have continuous night sweats and shortness of breath I went to my doctor only to find out that I have a severe infection coursing through my body which caused the lumps lymphnode infection They started me on strong antibiotics and I am awaiting results to find out exactly what type of infection I have Hope its not too serious So the long and the short of ita lump with no other symptoms may just be caused by some type of irritation A lump with other symptoms should be inspected by your doctor right away My doctor said that when these types of infections pop up lymphnodes they can get out of hand very quickly Just thought Id share Epsom salt can be found at any drug store or grocery store and is cheap More than likely this is a lymph node that is swollen Try warm compresses or soaking in warm bath water 34 times a day for 1520 minutes at a time this might be a tooth problem or TMJ problems no This could be a number of things It could very simply just be a skin irritation to a type of fabric or even laundry detergent that you are allergic too If this is the case then it is a simple fix just find out what you are allergic too by first changing laundry detergent then changing type of fabric used to make your underwear If this is the problem then it should go away pretty quickly Now it may also be a male yeast infection If this is the case then you need to buy some yeast infection cream and follow the application directions on the tube of cream You also may want to keep an eye on your intake of sugary substances or substances high in carbohydrates If these dont get rid of the bumps then it could possibly be an STD Sexually Transmitted Disease If you believe that this may be the case then you should go to your local clinic for testing as soon as possible Most STD tests are free or of little cost and you may remain anonymous If this is an STD then you need to get in to see a doctor right away so heshe can begin giving you the proper treatment Remember even if you have been tested before some STDs can go 46 years without showing up on a test and 10 years before you start to notice symptoms such as a rash or irritation The best advice I can give is to go see an oncologist Heshe would be the only one that could diagnose you with Lymphoma none I will ask for help when I have this problem Thank you for assumption none no Could be just hemorrhoids have you been constipated If so than I would definitely call it hemorrhoids and it is very painful but the best way to help that that I have found is soaking in a hot bath the hottest that you can stand soak for a while than get it out But I would also just keep an eye out for it and if you realize its getting bigger and more painful than get a hold of a Doctor but I would think it would be hemorrhoids Couldnt see the pic Ok if it was red at first and turned black I would assume that you may have gotten bit by somethingspider Also is it painful If its painful I would definitely think that its a spider bite because depending on what kind of spider it is most of the time when you get bit it will turn red at first like a pimple but the reason its turning black is that its a poisonous DONT PICK AT IT If you keep messing with it which I know sometimes is hard to do but without actually physically seeing it and assuming its a spider bite if you keep picking at it and messing with it than you can actually develop MRSA which would be bad So if it doesnt get better within give or take a few days to a week ask your doctor But what we did as a home remedy is we took a glass bottle of some kind and boiled it and stuck it over the infected spot to get the poison to release Hope I was some kind of help But yeah if it doesnt get better call your doctor That sounds exactly like an abcess and you need to get it treated now Im sure you have by now because the pain alone of one of those will drive you straight to the Emergency Room I have had then several times in a different location and they didnt give me anything for pain and started cutting on this thing I almost brought the house down That was probably the first time it happened I was living in Georgia And the antibiotic I was given in the ER wasnt strong enough and the abcess came back in less than a week I wanted to cut the thing out myself rather go back The pain is excruciating but you need to get the infection out and treated You just get a small amout of infection and the body tries to help you out by protecting you from this nasty little thing and it forms a knot like or ball around it and that in turn becomes very infected not always but most of the time It is worse than labor pains or at least mine was I hope you have been to the doctor and are on the healing end of this because I know how bad they can be If it is not an abcess it is something remarkedly close to it like its best friend and it still has to go I feel so bad for you I hope you have someone to go o the doctor with you and hold your hand or hold your feet down from kicking the first person in the head who tries to touch you Best care to you Make sure they give you good antibiotics and that does not mean a Z pak something stronger Take care Mental it could still b a stye  you may just b getting it more infected by trying to touch it i would say buy an eye wash  u can also find in pharmacys they have a eye washer which is a weird little plastic thing that cups your eye  whatcha do is put the eye wash in the cup n put it over your eye open your eye and put your head up id say do this about  4x a day if u dont see any change or if it gets worse go to your doctor you need your eyes dont want to joke around with something like that  i hope you feel better and i hope my advice helps  Good Luck The lump sounds like an abscess I would definitely consult my primary physician about treatment options It could have lead to an infection and can potentially lead to other health related issues Most likely this is a sebaceous cyst There are many oil glands in the genital region and the can sometimes get clogged Oil backs up in the gland and a small movable bump forms I have gotten many of these in various sizes My Gyno told me to apply a warm almost hot wash cloth to the area 3 times a day The heat causes the oils in the gland to unclog and the bump will go away If it gets to big or doesnt unclog see your doctor I think it is a swollen gland I get them sometimes as well I have also had the same problem of pain when swallowing food I have drunk hot tea with honey no milk and that helps with the pain Drink often as needed and the pain will subside Honey acts like an antibiotic and has natural healing powers unlike over the counter medications I had to have an exam and x rays and I was saying but nothing is sore in there and the Dr said there is not always pain at first How can I tell the difference between a haemorrhoid and an abscess I had same symptom on right thumb and it turned out to be a cyst Does the lump move a bit when pushed from the side my advise would be go to the er if it doesnt get better because these can be signs of a stroke or something else You didnt mention whether you have swelling or whether the extremity feels hot to the touch symptom of a blood clot You may have a varicose vain if swelling pain are not present I would certainly check with my doctor Better to be safe then sorry something went awry you should see a dermatologist I am a professional tattoo artist and in all my training I have never heard of this you cant inject that much ink and it doesnt synch up with scar formation or normal infections Most likely an irritant got into your skin via your fresh tattoo could be environmental or from an insect best to have a doctor look not necessarily but it could be a cist which sometimes does hurt when touched I had this once and it was and abscess from a tooth and was dead center in the roof of my mouth You need to talk to your mom or an adult you trust Dont let this wait There are lots of reasons other than cancer for lumps but early detection is the best And yes I am a breast cancer survivor How large is the lymph node Any lymph node can enlarge due to any type of bacteria or virus It could be from ear piercing wearing earrings that are not actual gold or silver due to inclusion of nickle in the metals commonly called German Silver which only refers to the color not that it is Sterling Silver A bug bite an ear infection any abrasions on the scalp neck Sometimes we dont know what causes the lymph nodes to enlarge It should go down in a couple of weeks It is important to note if there are any other symptoms chronic low grade fever night sweats and weight loss could indicate a lymphoma This is rarely the cause but must be attended to quickly If it remains enlarged and gets any larger without an infection nearby it is advised to see a doctor Ice may help bring it down Absolutely take him to a doctor It may be nothing but it may be a life threatening condition My 14 year old daughter had similar to what symptoms you describe and it was lymphoma Doctor first insisted it is just strep throat and with this it is common for all lymph nodes in body to swell and to have elevated temp Gave her antibiotics I kept calling doctor and nurse telling them it is getting worse and was told each time to wait that it will get better Several days later she could barely walk due to sever swelling and pain and I took her in demanding she be seen They found it to be cancer Dont wait Use common sense and listen to mothers intuition if what doctor tells you does not seem right Take him to the ER if you cant get in to doctors office because of lack of insurance Insist he be seen get a mammogram ASAP to rule out cancer See your doctor too might be an infection too  I have never heard of the medicine you are on but everytime I mention or show my doctor a lump in my neck or something he says its a lymph node that possibly I may getting a cold or something He says that is a sign your bodys trying to fight an infection Hope this helps some Possible causes are sebactus cysts or clogged pores yes it is normal it could take a week to a week in a half to fill normal agin it just the meds running there course but it will be fine no it wont but I will tell you this if you dont have the uti treated it can shut down your kidneys and you can end up in the hospital for quite a while so if I was you I would get it taken care asap The swollen lymph nodes could be connected to the herpes infection I have herpes and Ive gotten swollen lymph nodes in my pelvis linked to it As for HIV probably not but it depends on how long after the last incidence of unprotected sex vaginalanal did you get your negative HIV test If you received a negative HIV test at least 12 weeks after your last sexual contact then you are definitely HIV negative no matter how swollen your lymph nodes If it is less than that time especially less than 6 weeks then you will need to get tested again 12 weeks from your last unprotected sex encounter to confirm the negative result As for cancer that you would need to go to a doctor to determine but you should be checking yourself for lumps in other places genitals breasts etc If your having new problems breathing go to an emergency room near you or call 911 The other information is not useful to further diagnose you without an examination andor tests If you have had a past medical history of blood clots or recent surgery you should call 911 imediately Use ice to reduce swelling as soon as possible If no improvement in 1 wk see doctormay have damaged sac under knee cap sounds like spider bite if no improvement in 4 days see doctor Hi Thats interesting to know Thank you very much for that  Ill go check out the link you found and give it a thorough read soon Yes its only been very recent was quite surprised to feel it Its started to become itchier and a bit heavy feeling hard to describe I definitely feel it there now without physically touching it whereas before I didnt know it was there till I felt it As soon as I get a firm diagnosis Ill let you know in case it could help other women Cheers Hi Nohard not necessary consult doctor immediately "}
