power it is a prescription anti fungal power and helps very well I am going to be a mommy and I did ent have sex and my docture told my mom so yes you can No scaring intended But have you been checked for Breast Cancer My last exam the doctor asked if I was sore or if a yellow or green liquid was coming out My aunt had this problem and got checked out and it turned out she had stage four breast cancer Just a suggestion get yourself checked out for yourself My daughter had this when she was four years old My doc Told me that all it is a strep troat with a rash Yes you do need meds Strep is not fun with kidshope this helps Probably a very minor staph infection I get them all the time Id take a pregnancy test Id wait at least 2 weeks Gas How big are their nipples Perhaps its time for them to start wearing some sort of bra How much exercise do they regularly get Im a guy and Im in pretty great shape but if I run for a few hours a day every day after taking several weeks off my nipples can get sore from my shirt I imagine it could be the very same problem for a very young girl depending on how much and what type of exercise theyre getting Oh swimming pool  how long did they have their swimming suits on for Probably just a contact rash from having that wet cloth rubbing on their skin as they played around during the day  Your reaction to finding lump in your breast is completely understandable and normal I believe that your anxiety is really fear Anxiety and fear are interrelated conditions Anxiety causes fear and fear causes anxiety But there are differences Anxiety is a common emotion that is usually due to some vague feeling of apprehension without an obvious threat An example might be walking down a dark street alone at night and feeling afraid Fear on the other hand is an emotional response to a definite threat For example someone approaches you on that same dark street and says Stick them up Now you have a real threat and are justifiability fearful That lump in your breast was a real threat and must be considered as a legitimate fear Once that fear is totally removed your anxious feelings should subside Until you get a clean bill of health from your 2nd opinion physician please attempt to direct your focus on the results of your first opinion Enjoy life enjoy your family and have fun I hope that your wait to hear positive news this week is swift and that your emotional health is instantly restored The responsible action is to have a complete physical exam and the lumps evaluated by a doctor About 1 of all breast cancers affect men and result in more than 400 deaths per year In your case hopefully you dodged a bullet Because a decade and a half has passed since the lumps were first noted my gut reaction tells me that you have a condition called Gynecomastia But I am not a doctor Diagnosing a condition accurately based upon one distinct symptom over the web is virtually impossible Gynecomastia are breast lumps that typically begin in some young men during their teenage years in response to hormonal changes and are noncancerous growths Shifting hormonal levels in men during their 6th and 7th decades can also lead to Gynecomastia Please see a doctor for testing and to receive a definitive diagnosis The earlier that serious conditions are discovered and treated the better that the usual outcomes tend to be  A mole that appears asymmetrical should be medically evaluated Most noncancerous moles are symmetrical in appearance Asymmetrical moles are irregular growths and tend to enlarge with time Any mole exceeding 1 cm in size can also be a cause for concern In the medical circles the signs of melanoma may be summed up as follows A An asymmetrical skin growth B Border irregularity Most normal moles will have regular borders C Change in the color of the mole D Diameter of the mole exceeds 1cm Melanoma is highly treatable during its early stage If the cancerous growth is not caught early then this can become very a very serious disease You are smart to check your body regularly I recommend that create an appointment with a dermatologist to make a definitive assessment  Thanks for your responseI

is painful anxiety there could be inflammation or even something to do with your posture I used to continually get pains in my arm and occasional backache once I sorted out my posture and weight I was slightly over weight and fixed my bra size everything eased  There are breastmilk banks across the country if you are interested in obtaining breastmilk for your baby Breastmilk is a bodily fluid and can contain harmful viruses such as hepatitis BC HIV etc I would not recommend using frozen milk that someone offers you At least the milk from the milk bank has been screened Your baby will grow and develop normally whether you use donated milk from the milk bank or formula The most important thing is for you to follow your doctors advice and get back on the medications that are so important to your health Ultimately taking care of your needs is more important than offering breastmilk to your infant  Weaning yor child is up to you and your child Some kids will just stop sucking on mothers breasts on their own anywhere from 6 months to two years or more Some women just dont want to breastfeed after a year or so Other women have breastfed their kids until they are 5 years old One mother mother had two children 10 years apart The oldest child felt left out of the family because of all the attention the baby was getting The mother started to let him breastfeed as well My wife felt a large lump in one of her breasts She went to the doctor and he examined her Since he felt several areas in ech breast that was questionable and since she has 34F breasts he took about 10 minutes examining each breast He had her get an ultrasound and a mammogram A number of cysts were found and she was put on a number of OTC meds The problem went away after 6 months Yes go and see your doctor Has anything changed in your life like diet sex play or stress You say they are bouncier Are you wearing a bra less or excerising without a bra This is not bad but may have an affect on your breasts until you get use to the activityies Aggresiive sex play can produce sore breasts as well If this is the case the soreness will go away after a few months after they get use of the agressive fondling Has your diet or sex play changed recently See your doctor if this continues for a few months If you are having your breasts fondled and sucked on a lot this can produce milk leakage Just because we get older doesnt mean thatr our bodies dont react to stimuli Regardless of your age clothes rubbing on your nipples can cause irritation My wife was having the same problem I suggested clear double sided tape As crazy as it sounds it worked This is exactly what the doctor told my wife to use when we found a lump and several cysts in her breasts The lump and cysts went away It took about 4 months I know a woman who started to produce milk and was not pregnant She said her husband would suck on them for long periods of time nightafternight She felt them getting heavy and increased 2 cup sizes Dont know if this can happen to all women or not Your doctor should be able to determine the cause Yes the doctor told her that he wanted to be thorough and since she was so well endowed he wanted to make sure that he didnt miss anything I have no problem if he wanted to take 30 minutes with each breast I have even watched him examine her breasts on two visits He seems to be very professional and has her get into three different positions Better safe than sorry I know a woman who told me she had no breasts when she graduated from high school By the time she was 21 years old she had beautiful Dcup breasts Another woman told me she had small Bcup breasts when she went off to college She loved to have her breasts fondled and sucked on After a couple of years dating several guys who were into breasts as much as she was they grew to DDs Nature will give you your breasts Be patient She goes anywhere from 410 times a year No family history of breast cancer Christina you still may be correct in that he is trying to cop a feel in that he gives her a breast exam even if she goes in for a sore throat As I said I dont mind and she likes the doctor I am not sure why maybe because of the breast examslol Keloid scars do happen in some people more than others and it typically is a genetic potential that makes you prone to that What we use to treat keloids are a combination of two things Often simply cortisone injections into the scars themselves over time it takes a few treatments usually done at foursix week intervals will help flatten those scars There will still be a scar but it will be smoother and flatter The other thing that we can use is a pulsed dye laser that targets the blood vessel in the scar and helps it flatten So those two sometimes used together can help that area heal and become smoother softer and flatter more quickly Over time you may have to repeat the treatment because sometimes keloids reform over time But typically after a few treatments you will see the area get better and then maybe once a year or so you will have to retreat Any rash in pregnancy should be evaluated by your dermatologist It could be as simple as eczema or a type of easytotreat yeast infection called tinea versicolor which can happen in anyone However during this sensitive time it is wise to have a medical evaluation to definitively identify the underlying cause You definitely need to see a doctor about this as soon as possible If you are a woman this could be something benign like  but it also could be symptoms of heart attack Many people are familiar with the classic signs of an acute heart attack crushing or squeezing chest pain that may radiate down the left arm shortness of breath etc But heart attacks also can last only a few moments such as what youre describing You dont want to take any chances with this especially if you have other risk factors for a heart attack such as obesity high cholesterol a sedentary lifestyle and so on Please take care and get checked out as soon as possible First let me say good for you for noticing this lump Also youre very wellinformed for your age which will help you better manage your health and wellness Bravo Youre right that its not unusual for developing breasts to feel lumpy Youre also right that breast cancer is rare in your age group But you still should get that lump checked out For one thing youll have some peace of mind For another thing your health care provider can further educate you about what to expect as your breasts continue to develop I recommend you make an appointment soon with your primary care provider He or she can help you figure out whats going on here Best wishes to you Unfortunately there is no way to enlarge the breasts other than with surgery Were pretty much stuck with whatever Mother Nature gives us Breast enlargement or breast enhancement creams have not been scientifically proven to work I would be wary when spending money on any of these products If youre truly unhappy with the size of your breasts and dont want surgery you might consider getting some gel pads to slip into your bra These will make your breasts appear plumper Some bras even contain builtin enhancers to make your breasts look larger A good bra shop can help you find something Remember that breast size does not define your beauty or femininity Your true beauty shines from within Best wishes to you Well your symptoms certainly warrant a checkup What youre describing could be something as benign nonlife threatening as a cyst or something more serious The fact youve had pain and swelling in the area plus a fever could point more to an infectious process than to something like cancer but only a physical examination by a medical professional can say for sure And either way this lump seems to need treatment Id suggest you make an appointment with your primary health care provider as soon as possible to get this lump looked at Wishing you all the best In all probability what youre experiencing is simply irritation and dryness of the nipple which can be fixed by applying moisturizer That said the full answer is a bit more complicated The fact youre having pain throughout the whole breast presents something of a red flag Id suggest you see your primary care provider to have this more fully evaluated Obviously you dont want to take any chances that this is something more serious that just dry skin Even if youve had normal mammograms in the past tenderness in the breast is something to get evaluated With luck it will turn out to be something simple but youll get some peace of mind by having your health care provider evaluate this Good luck to you Thanks for providing all the great background information If several different doctors have told you the blemish is a cyst then thats probably accurate A is a pocket of tissue thats filled with some type of fluid The type of fluid can vary depending on the type of cyst Some are filled with fatty acids while others contain pus It sounds like your cyst is located within the skin layer not in the breast tissue which is good news Skin cysts are very common and do tend to drain occasionally as youve described The fact the cyst has gotten bigger and changed color is a good reason to have a health care provider reevaluate this Its possible the cyst needs to be treated by having it drained or even removed Only your health care provider can say for sure Cysts are an annoyance but luckily theyre not a serious disease Good luck to you as you cope with this Im sorry youre going through this but Im glad to see youre so vigilant about your breast health Way to go First let me say breast cancer in a 16yearold is exceedingly rare I want to put your mind at ease about that The problem is likely something far less serious It wouldnt hurt to get this situation checked out by your doctor or nurse practitioner It could be related to hormones because of course they fluctuate or something else thats very simple such as circulation issues Even if the situation clears up over the next few days Id suggest you get this looked at Youll feel less anxious and your doctor will get the condition into your medical history in case it occurs again Wishing you well Assuming your mammograms have always been clear and your nipple isnt leaking any fluid this sensitivity may simply be due to dry skin If you havent already tried applying moisturizer to the nipple Id suggest you do that You also may try padding the nipple inside your bra with a piece of soft gauze to see if that helps If the sensitivity persists or if the nipple gets red or crusty looking Id suggest you see your primary health care provider It is possible for cancers to arise in the nipple this is called  though its not very common Hope this helps This is a great question Thanks for asking In general I always suggest women of any age make an appointment with their primary health care provider if they experience of any kind Nipple discharge is not necessarily abnormal and doesnt mean you have breast cancer But because nipple discharge can be caused by a few scary conditions its usually best to have it checked out by a professional I hope this helps Im sorry to hear youre going through this How awful Youre right that certain antibiotics can cause an imbalance of good flora in the intestines and allow a bacterium called C diff to take over You should get checked out for this by your health care provider because if you do have C diff you need to be treated for it Clostridium difficile is highly contagious To avoid transmitting it to other people make sure you wash your hands frequently and thoroughly with warm soapy water Antibacterial hand rubs do not work against C diff The chest pain symptom may or may not be related to the antibiotic therapy Several conditions can cause the chest pain symptom you describe In women a condition called can cause the symptoms you describe Costochondroitis is basically an inflammation of the cartilage between the ribs and breastbone However because all of your symptoms occurred after the antibiotic usage you should report these side effects to your health care provider as soon as possible He or she will be able to thoroughly evaluate your symptoms and develop an appropriate treatment plan Best wishes Im sorry youre going through this As a former plastic surgery nurse Ive worked with many young men who have the issues you describe Id like to suggest you get your parents to take you for a visit to your primary care provider You can request to be seen privately without your parent in the room if that would make you more comfortable Show your health care provider your chest so he or she can determine if you have a condition called  Its not uncommon in young men Gynecomastia is an overgrowth of breast tissue in boys It can be caused by the hormonal changes of puberty If your health care provider suspects you have gynecomastia he or she may run a few blood tests to check your hormone levels Gynecomastia is treated with surgery Generally a small incision is made around the nipple and the excess breast tissue is removed A few stitches close the incision Of course other conditions can cause enlarged breasts in adolescent boys Your health care provider can make an accurate diagnosis and get you the appropriate care or treatment Best wishes to you Its very wise of you to ask this question Your best bet is to contact the surgeons office for their advice in this matter In my personal experience as a plastic surgery nurse I advised patients it was OK to remove the binder long enough to wash and dry it At a week postsurgery I would think this to be OK but every surgeon has different guidelines Thats why you should contact your surgeon to see what they recommend rather than taking my word for it Wishing you the best I think what youre asking is My breasts became saggy and deflated after I lost weight If I now regain weight will my breasts perk up again Sadly the answer is no When I worked as a plastic surgery nurse we had a saying Gravity always wins Whether its big breasts or a persons facial skin gravity eventually pulls everything toward our feet If youre now suffering from saggy breasts due to weight loss the only way to truly restore some youthful perkiness is through cosmetic surgery Some women can get by with a  while others need a lift and augmentation to get the results they desire If you lost weight for health reasons Id urge you not to deliberately put weight back on Youll probably live longer and have a better quality of life if you maintain a healthy weight and lifestyle Wishing you all the best Im sorry to have to tell you there really is no way to firm up saggy breasts except for having surgery When I was a plastic surgery nurse I worked with many women those who breastfed and those who didnt who wanted to restore a youthful contour to their breasts The only way to do that is by surgery As we women age our breasts naturally tend to droop If you find the droopiness bothersome you can look into a procedure called a also called mastoplasty or breast lift A plastic surgeon can examine you to tell you if youre a good candidate for this procedure Generally you want to be finished having children and breast feeding before you undergo a breast lift procedure You may find products like creams lotions and possibly even pills on the market that claim to help firm up the breasts None of these claims are backed up by any scientific evidence Hope this helps The key word in your question is benign Benign means noncancerous or not lifethreaning A is a benign tumor caused by excess formation of milkproducing glands in the breast Its possible for a fibroadenoma to continue getting larger as time goes on That doesnt mean it will suddenly turn cancerous You should ask your doctor how often to have this rechecked However once a year with your mammogram is probably sufficient If youre concerned about the lump in any way a quick call to the nurse at your doctors office might set your mind at ease Hope this helps Ah gravity It gets to all of us ladies sooner or later doesnt it Unfortunately I dont have good news for you Whether your breasts are naturally droopy due to age or whether you feel breastfeeding took an unkind toll the only way to lift those breasts back up is through also called mastopexy or mammoplasty Plastic surgeons and cosmetic surgeons perform this procedure which isnt usually covered by insurance If you really dont want to go through surgery the only other way to lift the breast up a bit is to use some sort of padding you can buy silicone bra inserts and a very good bra I recommend you see a certified bra fitter as a first step The vast majority of women do not wear the correct size bra A bra fitter will measure you to determine your real bra size and then help you choose a bra that gives you the best lift A bra fitter may also be able to help you find an insert to help your breasts look as good as possible in a bra In terms of various creams and potions you may see advertised to firm the breasts I want to mention there is absolutely no scientific evidence that they work  and no reason they would work Droopy or saggy breasts are largely due to stretchedout skin No cream or lotion can fix that All the best to you If you feel you may be hypothyroid it wouldnt be a bad idea to get checked out If you do have  you should be treated for it Breast tenderness generally isnt considered a symptom of hypothyroidism but it can be a symptom of other hormonal changes or imbalances Some women complain of breast tenderness during perimenopause or  and they also discover they are hypothyroid at that time So it can appear as if the hypothyroidism and tender breasts are linked when they arent necessarily in a clinical sense Your best bet is to make an appointment for an evaluation by a health care provider particularly since you said you have a lump on or near your thyroid gland Hypothyroidism can be treated and the sooner you catch it the better Best to you Whenever a health situation seems to be moving toward worse instead of better on the spectrum I always advise people to contact their health care provider for followup That seems to be the case with you and the breastarmpit lumps Even if everything came back normal four months ago these new symptoms deserve to be evaluated If Im misunderstanding you and the lumps were present four months ago when you had the biopsy and aspiration you still deserve an explanation for whats causing the lumps Its not enough to tell a patient its nothing and send them away You have the right to know what these lumps are and they could be simply noncancerous fibrous tumors or even enlarged lymph nodes for several reasons to set your mind at ease to understand if you need to seek any kind of additional treatment for help managing the pain I would suggest you start again with your GP If these lumps are new he or she will want to evaluate them If the lumps existed before he or she needs to give you a better explanation of whats going on Wishing you well The good news is this bump is on the skin Usually lumps on the skin arent serious in other words not like a breast cancer which usually resides deeper in the tissue Several things could cause a bump like you describe It could be a  for example If so the good news is it can be drained treated and probably wont return Other than that I wouldnt want to speculate Youve done the right thing by scheduling a medical appointment Try not to feel too anxious Soon youll know exactly what this thing is and then you can move forward with a treatment plan Feel better soon Even in women with regular periods what youre describing can be normal Sometimes our bodies hiccup a little bit Maybe thats what youre experiencing Other things to consider Have you recently had unprotected sex could you be pregnant Its possible to have a very light period right after becoming pregnant So if pregnancy is a possibility Id suggest you take a home pregnancy test At the other end of the spectrum is it possible youre premenopausal This could be another explanation for your unusual period this month If neither of these scenarios apply to you youre probably safe to wait and see what happens next month If everything proceeds as normal then youre good to go Hope this helps Sorry youre going through this but you may be encouraged to learn youre not alone And would you believe the most likely culprit for your symptoms is simply dry skin Many women occasionally suffer from very painful nipples due to dry skin Often the tips of the nipples turn a very angry red too Try applying some hand lotion to see if it helps Usually moisturizing for a few days clears up this situation Obviously if the situation gets worse instead of better or if you start experiencing a discharge from the nipple a rash that spreads fever or any other new symptoms then its time to seek medical attention But I have a hunch youre suffering the bane of dry nipples Its unbelievable how painful this condition can be Wishing you well Hi As a former plastic surgery nurse I feel uniquely qualified to answer your question  Its not uncommon for a woman especially one like yourself who considers herself a natural type person to feel uncomfortable physically and psychologically with her enhanced breasts in the time period immediately following the surgery In my experience this discomfort goes away pretty quickly as you get used to the new breasts When I was a plastic surgery nurse the surgeon I worked for always advised women to wait at least 3 months before making a decision about the size or removal of implants At the threemonth mark virtually all of the swelling has gone away and youve had time to adjust to your new look I can tell you in my experience none of our clients who felt as you do opted to have their implants removed once they got used to them I hope this helps ease your mind Youre still recovering so be kind to yourself and give both your body and your emotions time to cope with this surgery Best wishes to you Im sorry to hear youre going through this It cant hurt to get an opinion about your breast pain from a plastic and reconstructive surgeon preferably the one who performed the original procedure While its likely the cause of the pain is simply scar tissue that has developed over the years it could be something else And thats why getting an examination is the first step in figuring out what is causing your pain As you probably know all breast implants run the risk of becoming somewhat stiff and hard over the years as a result of encapsulation by fibrous tissue As time goes on this tissue can cause pain due to pulling on adjacent tissue or the breast implant itself And of course breast implants do not in any way protect against breast cancer Any woman with cosmetic breast implants should receive the same routine mammograms as a woman with natural breasts If you cant see the surgeon who performed the original surgery you can always start by seeing your family doctor or primary care provider He or she will do an initial evaluation and get you off to see a specialist if needed Wishing you well As a plastic and reconstructive surgery nurse I worked with many women who had large breasts that caused rashes or neck pain Heres what I can tell you The type of procedure youre looking for is breast reduction not augmentation will reduce the overall size of your breasts as well as perking them up so they sit in a more natural position Many insurance companies will cover breast reduction under certain conditions For example serious neck pain that doesnt respond to any other treatment like physical therapy and can be attributed to large breasts may be covered With rashes insurance companies seem in my experience less likely to cover breast reduction unless the rashes recur frequently and have not responded to other treatments You need to have documentation that youve seen your primary care provider multiple times and have tried prescription creams or whatever without clearing up the rashes for more than short periods of time Also with rashes your insurance may be less likely to cover the procedure if youre obese because in theory reducing the size of your abdomen might help the rash problem If youve tried without success to medically treat the rashes Id suggest you schedule an appointment with a plastic and reconstructive surgeon to discuss your options He or she wont be able to tell you if your insurance will cover a breast reduction but the surgeon can give you an opinion on whether you might benefit from breast reduction and can submit the claim for prior authorization After that its up to the individual insurer You need to know that breast reduction can impair your ability to nurse a baby Its doubtful youd be completely unable to nurse but removing breast tissue does reduce the number of milk ducts which can reduce the volume of milk your baby is able to get from nursing Hope this helps There are many possibilities in your case one possiblity could be shock Sometimes after injury or surgery the body experiences some form of shock It can cause a halt to some normal body functions for a while I would say you have some problems some where You should make an appointment with a gynecologist Maybe it is a hormonal issue I know fibro cystic breast disease will effect your breast that way Yet the period thing is something totally different Good luck with your problem I hope it works out ok It sounds like you need to be checked for breast cancer I do know they are some of the signs I hope it turns out to be nothing but it is always better to be safe than sorry You could take a home pregnancy test to find out or have your doctor take a blood sample Both can detect a certain hormone in a woman when she is pregnant then you dont have to wonder any more Ive had mine removed just over 2 years ago and still have problems with mostly eating certain foods Nothing to heavy and definitely no oils Laying on my side opposite of where the gallbladder was still makes an uncomfortable feeling as well No tight clothes either that doesnt help Dr says that some people are just more sensitive than others My mom had hers removed 4 years ago and no problems at all I had this and my doctor associated it with diet I stoped eating highly seasoned foods caffiene and all foods with caramel coloring It worked NO YOU SHOULD IT DOSENT HURT THEY WILL MAKE A SMALL HOLE AND IT WILL BE SMALL Had this once It was just gas If you dont think this is the cause and this doesnt go away try placing your hand on your left side see if pressing a specific spot hurts and go see a doctor Hope you feel better soon  I am 62 years old also and have been using Bioidentical Hormone Cream for about 4 months I am starting to experience sharp pains in my breast area over my heart Not sure if it is heart or breast related When I take asprin or Vit E it goes away I have had 3 episodes over the last month I am going to quit using the cream cold turkey I have also had spotting in the last 3 weeks I hope that going off this medication does not have a negative impact to my health Any input would be greatly appreciated To soon to tell Wait a week before your period is due and take a test Well if its happening in your lower back I would say that it could be a UTI Does it feel like you have to pee alot From my understanding this is not abnormal Women experience these types of symptoms after menstration in many cases It depends on how long it is after but it sounds like its right after you stop bleeding This is common but should be discussed with your OB or primary to make sure they understand I Would Have It Checked Out Or Ask Your Doc Many of the largest studies to show no benefit for breast selfexam BSE were done in countries outside the US such as Shanghai China in 2002 and Russia in 2003 In addition to no decrease in breast cancer deaths the largest studies showed an increased number of biopsies which found no cancer It is difficult to know if the outcome would be the same if a woman was instructed using the newest BSE technique taught to gynecologists in the US The issues surrounding the clinical breast exams CBE done by doctors are similar There is a large Canadian study which suggested fiveyear survival rates were the same in women who received only CBE and those who received CBE plus screening mammogram One of the current discussions explores the quality of CBE There are several techniques used and some MDs do a more thorough and systemic breast exam than their colleagues There are several other reasons to be having nipple discharge besides pregnancy or breastfeeding Some of these can include 1 Elevated prolactin level hormone that is elevated during breast feeding to make the milk due to medicationsThere are medications which can raise the blood prolactin level which then causes milk production The most common ones are antipsychotics and other psychiatric meds Sometimes the older blood pressure medications or even very high levels of THC have been implicated 2 Pituitary adenomaThis is a benign growth inside the pituitary gland which stimulates the production of prolactin The pituitary gland is where prolactin is always made 3 EstrogenIn some women estrogen eg birth control pills can increase milk production 4 Breast stimulationIf nipple play is a consistent part of sex it can raise prolactin levels just as a nursing baby can 5 Other type of breast discharge being mistaken for breast secretionsmilkThis is more often the case if the milk is coming from just one breast or just a couple of ducts in the nipple You really should see a GYN or your local county family planning clinic They will do a blood test to measure prolactin level to see if it is elevated If the problem is on one side only then a breast ultrasound or mammogram depending upon your age can be ordered If indicated a ductogram may be needed if the discharge if from one duct only If you are having a lot of milk you should get checked out It is most probably due to hormones  unless you have some other cause for breast tenderness such as starting to work out a severe respiratory infection chest wall inflammation etc You mentioned that you did not have your usual breast soreness before this period It arrived after the flow My best GUESS is that your last period may not have been linked to an ovulation Classically periods caused by ovulations have the most prominent premenstrual symptoms breast pain cramps etc Also if you missed an ovulation last month you have been exposed to continued levels of estrogen Estrogen has been a purported cause of breast tenderness and enlargement Hopefully this is just a temporary thing If the bilateral breast pain persists or you develop other symptoms such as the pain and blistering of shingles on the chest you should see your GYN or clinic for a breast exam What is the usual time to be developed Lack of breast development by age thirteen merits some monitoring The small firm breast buds usually appear about age eleven By age thirteen a majority of girls have the beginnings of a moundshape of breast tissue Unless there is an overt reason for lack of development such as illness radiation exposure or hormonal problems there is evidence that breast development can continue until ones early 20s While most all of us have at least some difference in size between our two breasts there are situations where the size difference is very apparent Size differences which onset in teen years will likely equalize for about 75 of women Yours Jane HH It is probably caused by the birth control pill Make sure she is taking the lowest dose she can to prevent pregnancy The best thing for her to do is make sure she is on the lowest dose she can be She needs to not smoke if she does while taking birth control pills Bleeding spotting nausea symptoms of pregnancy are common with birth control pills Do a test personally I have had false negatives in the past but a false positive is rare good luck x Theres a good possibility that your posture is causing your back pain What I would suggest to you is decompressing the back You can do this with back pain exercises I would suggest visiting httpwwwdoctorspainreliefsystemscom Theres a few videos that will show you how to properly perform these back pain exercises Sitting for long periods of a time can result in the back pain If you can get up and stretch a little during the prolong hours of sitting its going to help you relieve your pain a little Youre always welcome to read more Hope this helps Everybody is right and you can also take the Tylenol extra strength I dont want to question anything but did you know that sitting too much can lead to physical inactivity and obesity and death So check in with a doctor and heshe should give you a medication for back pain or if not then you can get Tylenol extra strength In a 28 day cycle ovulation likely takes place around day 14 Pregnancy can result from intercourse 4 days before to 3 days after ovulation which would be days 10 to 17 So yes that activity on day 12 could lead to pregnancy but Id be surprised at the symptoms showing so quickly You Might Want to go Check For Endemitriosis I Have that And those are the Same symptoms i get Yes Although it is hard to say if you have the flu or not if you are still feeling ill please call you healthcare provider and ask their advice about treatment for your illness If you get the flu pumping your breast milk and having a healthy adult give your baby the breast milk is a good way to protect your baby The flu virus is not transmitted through breast milk Maternal antibodies are transmitted through breast milk which may actually help protect the child if she was already exposed to influenza It is OK to take antivirals to treat the flu while you are breastfeeding If there is no one else who can take care of your baby while you are sick try to wear a face mask at all times when you are feeding or caring for your baby You should also be very careful about washing your hands and taking everyday precautions to prevent your baby from getting flu Using a cloth blanket between you and your baby during feedings might also help If you think your baby has developed flulike symptoms please call your healthcare provider

am a firm believer that emotional health has a ton to do with physical health so keep her in good spirits As a breast cancer survivor I can share what Ive learned from my experiences I am not a medical professional I can only give my opinions It sounds like you are but get a pregnancy test and if you are not pregnant then it is the virus I dont know you sexual history but if you have had sexual intercourse You could be having a miscarriage or even worse a Tubal pregnancy If you feel either of these could be the case you need to contact your OBGYN right away If you have not had sexual intercourse there are many things that can affect your cycle I had something similar Call the doctor blood tests may be necessary for a recurring fever It would appear so It seems it has to do with the fact of hormone changes during your cycle After checking some forums for you It seems that it can be from several things I would if I were you check with my OBGYN to play it safe This happened to my sister before and her period and it got pretty serious she got a infection because the doctor said that their was a build up of dried blood that stayed inside her due to leaving her tampon inside her for a long time I would recomened using a pad if this happens or getting yourself cleaned Unfortunately there is no standard charge However there are some price transparency tools that can help give you an idea If you get insurance at work check to see if your employer offers one Your insurer may also have a pricing tool And then there are sites such as FairHealthConsumerorg HealthBlueBookcom and NewChoiceHealthcom Yes if you are female and have had sexual intercourse Either hormonal changes or imbalance or an effect of your menstrual cycle Get your hormones checkedcould be a sign of something wrong It is due to your hormones Most likely you are not pregnant but it is important that you go get checked every so often You are probably going to get your period soon also While you want to check with your pediatrician it sounds like your baby is experiencing infant regurgitation also called spit up where the contents in the stomach reflux back into the esophagus This occurs frequently in babies because the muscles at the lower esophageal sphincter muscle responsible for keeping food from coming back up are weak Your pediatrician should be able to tell you if it is problematic which usually happens when reflux causes problems such as inflammation swallowing problems poor weight gain and food refusal For the most part frequent regurgitation is considered normal when growth is fine and the child eats with well with no other signs of distress Because you are breastfeeding there could be other things contributing such as an overactive letdown milk comes out fast and laying baby down right after feeding A lactation consultant can help you troubleshoot feeding your baby to decrease vomiting For more on this subject see this WebMD article Congrats on your new baby  When you say cant keep food down Im not sure if it is forceful vomiting or frequent spit up Gastroesophageal reflux GER when food comes back up is common in babies occurring in half of babies under 6 months old Some are referred to as happy spitters meaning they frequently regurgitate 2 or more times per day but are growing and eating without other issues But if it gets worse with time or is more projectile or is accompanied by other symptoms wheezing gagging etc and there is poor growth its a problem Gastroesophageal reflux disease GERD is GER coupled with problematic symptoms and needs a doctors attention If you suspect your child has GERD or some other problem see your doctor again For more on GERD see this WebMD article You also might want to see a lactation consutant for tips on breastfeeding positions and feeding techniques like pumping before feeds to decrease spitting up after feeding Good luck Some women who plan to have a mastectomy decide to have breast reconstruction Other women prefer to wear a breast form prosthesis Others decide to do nothing All of these options have pros and cons What is right for one woman may not be right for another What is important is that nearly every woman treated for breast cancer has choices Breast reconstruction may be done at the same time as the mastectomy or later on If you are thinking about breast reconstruction you should talk to a plastic surgeon before the mastectomy even if you plan to have your reconstruction later on There are many ways to reconstruct the breast Some women choose to have implants Implants may be made of saline or silicone The safety of silicone breast implants has been under review by the Food and Drug Administration FDA for several years If you are thinking about having silicone implants you may want to talk with your doctor about the FDA findings Your doctor can tell you if silicone implants are an option You also can read information from the FDA on breast implants at httpwwwfdagovcdrhbreastimplants You also may have breast reconstruction with tissue that the plastic surgeon moves from another part of your body Skin muscle and fat can come from your lower abdomen back or buttocks The surgeon uses this tissue to create a breast shape Which type of reconstruction is best depends on your age body type and the type of surgery you had The plastic surgeon can explain the risks and benefits of each type of reconstruction Physical Examination A manual examination of the breast is an important screening method for detecting cancer and is the first step in the evaluation of a breast lump Unfortunately the manual examination of the breast is not perfect However if a mass can be felt manually it is important to estimate the location of the mass so that the mammogram andor other diagnostic examinations can focus on the particular area A doctor also inspects any suspicious skin changes that may be a sign of breast cancer Since the manual examination can miss breast cancer mammography is also important as a screening tool Mammogram Women with a breast lump need to have a mammogram of both breasts A mammogram is estimated to be able to detect about 90 of breast cancers This means that about 10 of breast cancers are missed by mammography Therefore if a woman or her physician feels a lump and the mammogram is normal further studies or biopsies are carried out to rule out cancer Sometimes a certain pattern of calcium deposits appears on the mammogram that makes the doctor suspicious of cancer In these cases it is often recommended that a biopsy be taken that is guided by a mammography technician to be sure the correct area is sampled Ultrasound Ultrasound is useful in the evaluation of breast lumps It can distinguish between a cyst such as a benign cyst which is filled with fluid and a solid lump which may or may not be cancerous The first step in the evaluation of a breast lump is to determine whether it is a cyst or solid mass and this is what an ultrasound can do best Especially in young women in whom a benign cyst may be suspected if the womans ultrasound confirms a typical cyst she may not require any procedures or biopsies If it is unclear on the ultrasound whether the lump is completely a cyst a further evaluation is usually recommended MRI Magnetic resonance imaging is becoming more widely used in the evaluation of breast lumps MRI is a special radiology technique designed to image internal structures of the body using magnetism radio waves and a computer to produce the images of body structures Cancers require a greater blood supply than noncancerous growths and the images obtained from an MRI may help determine whether a particular area is cancerous because the MRI shows greater contrast in those areas with an increased blood supply In most cases MRI is performed if results of mammography and ultrasound evaluations are not conclusive MRI also has limitations For example MRI cannot detect the presence of calcium deposits which can be identified by mammography and may be a sign of cancer When Mirena becomes embedded it may no longer prevent pregnancy So yes its possible You should give your doctor a call to see if youre pregnant or if something else is going on i am having some chest pain as well it started with swelling about a week ago and the pain seems to be getting worse everyday my breast is burning and feels very heavy i am more tired than usual and my armpit is sore also For some people a urine test stick does not always work The HCG Hormone or pregnancy hormone may not be prevelant enough for the pee test to work I had a friend who had this problem She tried a pee test after she was knowingly several months pregnant and still came back with several false pee test You will have to go to your doctor and have a blood test done to confirm wether or not you are pregnant For whatever reason you may be one that a home pregnancy test might not work Your other symptoms could be pregnancy related but if not your doctor should be able to help you figure out what may be causing your symptoms Good luck I wouldnt worry about how large your breast are currently They will likely grow some during your later stage of pregnancy as well as when your milk starts coming in after delivery Breast tissue covers a larger area than just the part that sticks out sorry for the lack of technical terminology  All of your breast tissue contains milk ducts which will fill in with milk after you have your baby So even if you dont get large breasts does not mean you wont produce enough milk to breast feed Your milk wont come in all at once either First you will produce small amounts of colostrum and as your baby nurses your body will start to increase milk production There are breast feeding councilors at the hospital that can give you more indepth answers and would be happy to help you also 5050 Hi Well its either a skipped period or your pregnant if its the

just for reference This is any fluid that leaks or seeps out of the nipple in a woman who is not pregnant or breastfeeding Nipple discharge may be clear white yellow green rusty or bloody Although nipple discharge is not necessarily abnormal it should be evaluated by a health care provider Nipple discharge is rarely a sign of breast cancer Least worrisome is milky or colored but not bloody discharge that occurs when the nipple is squeezed such as during self breast examination Most worrisome is bloody discharge that occurs on its own spontaneous Your provider may test the discharge for blood and cytology abnormal cells and may order an ultrasound and mammogram There are many benign not cancer causes of nipple discharge such as medications breast infection pregnancy imbalance of the hormone prolactin and excessive breast stimulation Take care to avoid nipple stimulation including frequent checks for discharge because stimulation actually makes the discharge persist This is from httpswwwdeltamedixcombreastcaredeltamedixbreastcarecommonproblemsphp Nipple discharge accompanies some benign breast conditions Since the breast is a gland secretions from the nipple of a mature woman are not unusual nor even necessarily a sign of disease For example small amounts of discharge commonly occur in women taking birth control pills or certain other medications including sedatives and tranquilizers If the discharge is being caused by a disease the disease is more likely to be benign than cancerous Nipple discharges come in a variety of colors and textures A milky discharge can be traced to many causes including thyroid malfunction and oral contraceptives or other drugs Women with generalized breast lumpiness may have a sticky discharge that is brown or green The doctor will take a sample of the discharge and send it to a laboratory to be analyzed Benign sticky discharges are treated chiefly by keeping the nipple clean A discharge caused by infection may require antibiotics One of the most common sources of a bloody or sticky discharge is an intraductal papilloma a small wartlike growth that projects into breast ducts near the nipple Any slight bump or bruise in the area of the nipple can cause the papilloma to bleed Single solitary intraductal papillomas usually affect women nearing menopause If the discharge becomes bothersome the diseased duct can be removed surgically without damaging the appearance of the breast Multiple intraductal papillomas in contrast are more common in younger women They often occur in both breasts and are more likely to be associated with a lump than with nipple discharge Multiple intraductal papillomas or any papillomas associated with a lump need to be removed This was from

discharge this is from WebMD Normal nipple discharge more commonly occurs in both nipples and is often released when the nipples are compressed or squeezed Some women who are concerned about breast secretions may actually cause it to worsen They do this by repeatedly squeezing their nipples to check for nipple discharge In these instances leaving the nipples alone for a while may help the condition to improve Based on your medical evaluation your doctor will determine whether your nipple discharge is normal physiologic or abnormal pathologic Even if your doctor determines your breast discharge is abnormal keep in mind that most pathological conditions that cause nipple discharge are not serious and are easily treated But I would see your doctor if your still worried but as they say try not squeezing them for a couple of weeks unless this is just a natural occurrence then thats just you You may need some extra nipple covers to soak it up but as you get older it may just stop

boyfriend complain Is this after you take off your bra it could be you need a bigger bra you need to go somewhere and get a proper measure done Hope this helps Good Luck Hi Your find its called Mastalgia its quite a common thing But the causes of mastalgia or breast pain are not very well understood and the treatments are not well defined either When suffering from mastalgia start by going for a full breast check up which should include an examination by your doctor possibly followed by an ultrasound or mammogram to detect any hidden problems If there is no lump felt on breast exam or mass seen on mammogram then the pain can be treated nonsurgically If there is a cyst seen on ultrasound in the area of pain or tenderness the cyst fluid may be aspirated with a needle in the surgeons office So from what you have said you have done all of the above with no results Breast pain can be cyclic or noncyclic Cyclic mastalgia is breast pain that has a clear relationship to the menstrual cycle and may indicate a hormonal imbalance Mastalgia is often experienced as an early sign of menopause for women in their 40s Breasts are made of glandular tissue which swells with the accumulation of fluid when influenced by hormones During pregnancy this results in the manufacturing of milk During other states of hormonal flux the result is pain So in all your tests have you had a blood test for your hormones Caffeine coffee teas and chocolate causes increased swelling of breast tissue as does a diet high in salt There is evidence that fatty foods and diary products can contribute to breast pain The most common medications to blame are birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy and occasionally antidepressants and others Stress is a major contributor to mastalgia due to the link between hormone secretion and our emotions Treatments include the use of topical applications natural supplements or medication in more resistant cases Reduce or avoid foods that worsen pain while adding Vitamin E and evening primrose oil Exercise and stress reduction may help Topical applications of iodine or antiinflammatory creams may be effective Do hope something here helps you Good

costochondritis or Tietzs Syndrome Of you must know that also a breast cancer called fibroadenoma could be the cause It could be localized deep in breast tissue so you wont be able to palpate it Best thing for you is to contact your GP as soon as possible Your GP will examine your breasts and take a detailed history of the type of pain you have and how often it occurs Hope this is of some help

Good Luck Hi OK Question dose this ring slip off with this weight gain or dose it stay in place the whole time Please come back Hi Tumours can grow for a variety of reasons Benign tumours are not caused by cancer Tumours caused by cancer are called malignant or cancerous While the underlying causes for tumour growth can vary the process by which they grow is the same Normally cells in your body will naturally refresh themselves by dividing This allows for dead cells to be disposed of naturally In the case of tumours dead cells may remain behind and form a growth known as a tumour Cancer cells grow in this way as well however unlike the cells in benign tumours they also invade nearby tissue Outofcontrol growth of abnormal cells causes damage to these adjacent tissues and organs and can lead to cancerous tumours in other parts of the body I do hope this helps you Good Luck Hi You may find that you already have a yeast infection now sea salt is good at clearing vaginal yeast

would see your doctor or gyno if your not on BC perhaps this could regulate your problem Good Luck Hi your Mirena IUD is a progesterone based device for BC so see below Stimulates Growth and Development Estrogen is the primary hormone that stimulates breast growth during puberty but progesterone is required to convert the female breast into a milkproducing organ Dr Carol Lange reports in the article in Steroids that progesterone along with other hormones stimulates development of the mammary glands in the breast So thats why your now a DD If your happy Just enjoy Good Luck Hi Its a funny one but have found some info that might help but no rice beads If you worry about those  funny bumps  on the areola those are supposed to be there they are called Montgomery glands or areolar skin glands Their function is partially unknown but scientists suppose they secrete a liquid that lubricates the nippleareola area These Montgomery glands can be about unnoticeable OR stand out as bumps on the areola They often become more prominent during pregnancy Also it appears they are white in some women Some women have squeezed them and can get a white substance out but please do NOT squeeze them because that causes them to become infected In one study it was noted that women with more areolar glands had better or more optimal breastfeeding start after delivery They also noted that the glands were seen in virtually all women in the study but with great interindividual variations their areolar distribution was nonrandom and about 15 of the women had glands giving off a secretion this is about women who have just given birth So hope this bit helps Ile try doing some more research for you Good Luck Hi Try this link it will either help or your hate me but its all I could find on blocked milk ducts but please read it all the way down it gets better The Link httpkellymomcombfconcernsmothermastitis Hope it helps Good Luck Try searching for a free clinic in your area Get to a good woman OBGYN You may require a D  C Doesnt mean that you are not pregnant You might be having a fallopian tube pregnancy which is very serious Go see a ObGyn doctor right away for test to confirm Those home pregnancy tests dont always tell the truth Over the counter pregnancy tests are generally very reliable so it unlikely that you are pregnant However I would recommend that you see your doctor just to make sure since you are having symptoms of being pregnant Your doctor may also do some additional blood work including a thyroid test to evaluate other reasons for the symptoms which you are experiencing Ask your doctor to order an HCG blood test This will definately tell you that may be the case if you are taking any kind of estrogen supplement or possibly oral contraceptives thats my best guess im not too keen on many issues of the female anatomy i apologize If you had unprotected sex and missed a pill you could be pregnant If you are late take a home test Id have to examine them in order to know for sure whats causing it The only way to know for sure is to take a pregnancy test Good luck Have you ever got a second opinion Im sure this wont come as a shock to you but you need to quit smoking Are you aware that if your lungs get compromised enough you can have a heart attack Tramadol can pass into breast milk and may harm a nursing baby You should not breastfeed while you are taking tramadol Speak to your doctorobgyn about another safer option If your doctor gave this to you and didnt ask if you were breast feeding or if they gave it to you and knew you were breast feeding  GET A NEW DOCTOR Theyre putting your babys health at risk Hospitals are contracted with insurance companys Hospitals can charge whatever they want BUT insurances tell the hospital per contract what the hospital is allowed to charge Then the hospital does the contractual adjustment and writes off the difference IE Bx costs 20000 Insurance says no contracted rate is 4000 Hospital writes off 16000 and bills insurance the 4000 Every insurance has a contracted rate for the procedure Again the insurance tells the hospital what its allowed to charge One insurance says hospital can bill 4000 another says contracted rate is 5000 another says contracted rate is 3000 So it all really depends on what insurance policy you have and what your insurance states the hospital can charge  Go see a doctor now As a 9 year Breast Cancer survivor dont take any chances What are you waiting for This can absolutely happen Just wear a nursing pad to absorb the milk Yes but you should be using a prescribed antiyeast medication I often recommend the same prescription medication I would treat a baby with oral thrush also yeast Ask your medical provider or the babys pediatrician to prescribe it for you Who are you dating Hannibal Lector Yes a bit can cause a deep bruise called a hematoma and this can form a lump for a while It should eventually go away as you body reabsorbs the blood in this tissueand if your boyfriend bites you again HE should go away Babies need to be on formula OR breast milk for ONE YEAR  After a year as long as they get all of the calcium phosphorous and other nutrients that are in milk and are eating a good wellbalanced diet they do not really need it Milk and milk products yogurt cheese etc continues to be an excellent protein source and should not be abandoned unless there is a milk allergy or other medical reason to do so Nothis herb will not change the size of your breasts You may be able to go back to work NOW assuming that you are under the proper antibiotic treatment and your breast infection remains covered I assume it does Your doctor can release you when every thing is fine Communityacquired MRSA is very very treatable the hospital types are more difficult of course so with proper care you will be just fine I see MRSA patients nearly every week Keloids are very challenging to remove so you will need the services of a good dermatologist to help you Steroid injections are often used but there are other methods that the dermatologist can discuss with you This is not something you can do at home or with any overthecounter medications Surgically removing a keloid is iffy since the surgery alone can create a new keloid to replace the one that was removed Infants are not protected against oral herpes anytimewhether they are breastfed or not While the mother does impart wonderful immunity to the infants through the maternal blood supply and breast milk it is not a sure thing that this immune response fully protects an infant from herpes or any other infectious disease Not worried but definitely concerned Your daughter should be evaluated by her pediatrician first and then by a pediatric endocrinologist The main concern of course would be that she has precocious puberty What can start out as breast buds could progress to pubic hair if her little brain is somehow sending out singles to her ovaries that she is older than her chronological age We do not want a fouryear old wearing a bra by kindergarten A bra would not be the major concern however It would be all of the other bodily changes that start at puberty that is a larger concern Infants can have breast buds due to maternal estrogen but when a fouryear old develops breast buds from making estrogen on her own it is concerning and this must be properly evaluated You are correct It would be highly unusual never seen it in fact for a 14 year old to have a breast cancer so the most logical lump for you to have would be a cyst Some can be very firm fibrocystic mass and many will seem to change in size around your menstrual period It would be best to have any lump or mass properly examined so a visit to your primary care medical provider is indicated You are to be complimented for being aware of these changes Dont try and pop it or open it in any way Cover it with a bandaid and a topical antibiotic ointment until you can see your medical provider Your OB can examine you and determine if you need a different course of treatment Go by his birthday and consider holding back on solids for another month or so His formula is much more important to his overall nutriion than cereal or baby food at this time but get input from his pediatrician There is no need to rush solidshe will be eating for the rest of his life he primarily needs to get his nutrients from the formula It is not possible to diagnose what could it be a rash simply by its location The skin only does one thingit rashes and there are thousands of different things that can cause it If the steroid cream you are using is not helping then one possibility would be yeast Yes yeast loves warm dark most places and the area under the breast is a common site to have a cutaneous skin yeast infection Again I am not blindly telling you that you have yeast This is jsut one of the many possibilities You would need to see a medical provider for an examination to make that diagnostic call You will need to see a medical provider so that you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated There is really no way to blindly make a determination about your concerns over the Internet I am sorry Obviously I do not know your wifes medical history and breast cancer risks nor can I examine her and view those mammogram results but I can probably backup the surgeons decision Mammograms are not perfect The ONLY way to get a 100 assurance that this calcification is truly benign is by a pathological specimenexamining it carefully under a microscope by a train pathologist Even a biopsy a small piece of this calcification can be wrong so a EXCISIONAL BIOPSY is often the best way to go This way the entire calcified area is removed and examined If this tissue is benign that you will know conclusively that this area is not cancer you and your wife can relax and will not have to worry that the mammogram missed something In medicine we have a saying Gone is Good That calcification is now gone it was not cancer and this is GOOD It indicates a need for you to see your medical provider so that you can have this breast properly examined searching for a source of the bloody discharge Please do not read into this and think of all of the bad things that it could bejust get evaluated These are presumptive signs of pregnancy but of course there can be other reasons to account for your symptoms Have your medical provider order a moresensitive blood pregnancy test Your doctor is being thoroughtrying to give you a more definite answer based on the results of BOTH tests There is always a cause to be concerned so your doctor is trying to alleviate any diagnostic uncertainty I am very sorry but without a handson examination and a detailed medical history it would not be possible to blindly offer you a definite diagnosis determine if this mass was cancer and suggest a treatment In order for you to be properly diagnosed I would suggest that you see a surgeonsomeone who can examine this mass perhaps do a biopsy and address this tenyear old problem I assume you are pumping your breasts Otherwise nature does not really allow you to know how many ounces your baby is getting BasicallyBreast is Best so give him what he wants Cereral at this age is just practice eating so a few ounces is just fine Mix the cereal with the breast milk Only if he is a crossdresser or transvestite No you do not need to wear a bra unless of course that is what you are into Obviously I do not know anything about you age medical history nor can I examine this skin eruption Making a blind guess is difficult but a common under the breast growing red skin eruption could be candidiasis a yeast infection You would need to see your medical provider so that you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated It is time to go back againyour doctor may either aspirate again or suggest that you have a surgical procedure to completely remove these painful cysts once and for all Obviously I cannot examine you son but he most likely has ADOLESCENT GYNECOMASTIAa hormonal sideeffect of good ol puberty Yes these can be tender Ibuprofen may help and obviously he should avoid trauma to this area or trauma from teasing brothersfriends who like to pinch them or give him a painful twister or purple nurple Ask you son and he will explain what this isThese things can add to the normal discomfort of course Research adolescent gynecomastia on the internet If you are concerned you can see his regular medical provider for a consultation There is a book by this same title so you can buy it on Amazon and get the answer firsthand Without nipples how would teenage boys torture each other with twisters What would punk guys have left to pierce How would you know when it was cold Nipples in men have no medical purpose but since it hurts to remove them and you will look a little weird without them just leave em alone Maybe another few thousand years of evolution will make them disappear There is really nothing nonsurgical that can permanent fix asymmetrical breast sizes Sure you can use padding on the smaller side to fill the gap in the bra but that does not alter your selfimage when that bra is removed Just about every female patient that I have had over the years who underwent a breast surgery for enlargement making them firmer after a few kids or even having a breast reduction are happy Prices vary on this cosmetic procedure but so do prices on used cars You can spend 5000 a guess since the price varies on a boobjob or 5000 a used car The breast job does not require gasoline insurance or much maintenance and will last a lifetime The car It will eventually fall apart You can get a car loan to buy ityou can get a boob loan to pay for surgery if this is important to you You will likely be glad that you did and your husbandI dont think he will be complaining very much I know that money can be tight but making a modest monthly payment to pay off your new breasts is really something I think most families can financially manage with a bit of planning You had two childrenyour deserve it Many cosmetic surgeons have free consultations Make a few appointments and take your husband with you I am sorry but I have never read an article of this nature nor do I believe that this exercise would increase male breast size Breasts are depositions of fat and exercises do not fat deposition Gaining excessive weight may do it but I cant recommend it I am not sure why you want to do this but I dont believe the any exercise or massage would likely alter the size of male or female breasts There can be other causes for black stools other than a gastric stomach bleed Bleeding from the stomach melena causes black TARRY stools Blood in other areas of your intestinal tract may be occult hidden or appear as brown bright red in your stools either mixed in or streaked If you stool tests for occult blood are consistently negative you need to do several on different days over a longer period of time then you most likely do not have bleeding as a cause of your darker stools Spinachleafygreens and the bismuth in Pepto Bismol are common nonbleeding causes Keep working with your doctor to get your relativelymild anemia in control and certainly investigate the reason for pain under your breastsince it still could be gastrointestinaly related Migraines are vascular headaches and not all headaches are migraines Migraine does not mean a severe headache it is just one type of over a hundred different kinds of headaches The type of headache you may be describing is one of the more common typesa muscletension headache but the pain under the breast is not a typical symptom Muscletension headache can certainly come from the neck Since you cannot be blindly diagnosed over the Internet I would suggest that you see your medical provider for a proper examination Babies under three months old typically get lots of intestinal gas mostly because their intestinal flora the good bacteria isnt sufficient at this point Sometimes they will swallow air when they nurse but most of the time the gas is just a byproduct of all of the mothers mild lactose being digested Breast fed is best so you are giving him the proper food Simethicone found in overthecounter products like Mylicon Infant Drops can be helpful in making some of those big bubbles into tiny bubbles Talk to his pediatrician first to make sure this would be appropriate for him continue to burp him after nursing and hang in there Most gassy babies will miraculously improve after age three months Your testosterone levels are probably fine but you can ask for a blood test to be sure At age 22 testosterone levels tend to be raging so your medical provider may discount your request to the test The fact that you have some fatty breast enlargement man boobs does not imply you have a hormonal issue Since breast tissue is primarily fatty tissue in men this is not a red flag but you will have to have your medical provider make that call The amount of body hair especially facial hair a person has is usually geneticallydetermined If you got a hairy parent like Sasquatch then expect to be hairy If your genetics or ethnicity is one where facial body hair is less common you may be more likely to follow that pathway In my early 20s like you I had a tough time growing a decent mustache I now have a full beard and hair growing out of my ears Maybe the same will happen to you I can help you with advice but unfortunately a brief description is not sufficient to be able to offer you a definite answer as to the nature of your breast lump You will need to see your medical provider for a careful examination and perhaps some imaging studies Many lumps on younger women are cysts but this important call cannot be made blindlyyou MUST have a proper examination Not really Yeast tends to be on the skin surface Although age eight is a bit early little girls can start having breast buds at that age At age nine it may be considered normal There are many factors that could accelerate puberty so it would be wise for your granddaughter to be properly examined by her pediatrician to make sure that she is not having precocious puberty early puberty If she is just developing early there is really nothing that needs to be done in most cases other than careful observation by her medical provider Injection of WHAT Rabies vaccine Antibiotic I dont have enough information to address your question so I suggest that you call your doctor for a patientspecific response You cannot be adequately diagnosed by symptoms alone You will need to SEE a medical professional for a proper examination and thorough medical history in order to narrowdown the MANY possibilities that can account for your pain This cannot be done blindly over the Internet Not knowing if you are a male or female I would have to sayYES If one of your breasts has suddenly doubled in size I would think this would be concerningconcerning enough for you to see your medical provider for a properly examination Estrogen is not an acceptable nor natural pharmacological method of enhancing the size of your female breasts otherwise women on birth control pills or women who are taking estrogen after menapause would have enlarging breasts What Nature has not provided clothing or bra choices can help compensate or you will need to see a plasticcosmetic surgeon Estrogen is NOT the way to go I would not recommend it She still needs the micronutrients for growth and brain development that is only found in formula Talk to your pediatrician and get several different samples of formula and I think you may find one that is more palatable to her She is eating more solids now so the amount of formula she will be drinking will be less and less over the next four months As you get closer to age one you can change to whole milk Absolutely And the reverse it also true a breastfed baby with thrush can transmit this yeast to his Moms nipples This is an easyfix Call the babys pediatrican for advice and some prescription help No that would be silly Duct taping sagging breasts is not a homemade substitution for plastic surgery or a good supportive bra Duct tape can have thousands of uses but this is not one of them Babies under three months of age have very little beneficial bacteria in their colon Consequently they will often be very very gassy impressive in fact as well as fussy It is not your prenatal vitamins This tends to miraculously improve after three months of age so keep using those gas drops and hang in there  No but he could wear a tight tshirt if this is concerning A bra is really out of the question Yes you can get pregnant That is why the Implanon has an expiration datethe point where the hormone has depleted This may be why your period is not normal Use a secondary form of birth control like a condom or you will be just taking chances Breast tenderness alone is not a definitive symptom of pregnancy so just hang in there Repeat your pregnancy test in a week or so I dont knowa medical professional would need to see this scan and correlate it with clinical findings a breast exam Show the scan to your doctor and have him or her render an opinion Not all masses are seriousor cancer so dont be prematurely concerned Yes these little are normal and they can even leak a drop of breast milk You and your child shared a blood supply and your blood had high levels of a hormone that prepared you for breastfeeding Those same hormones are in your daughters blood supply right now but it will soon dissipate Then you will not see those breasts again until she make her own hormones It is possible to pass HPV to a newborn but not through breast milk Active untreated HPV can be passed to a baby during a vaginal birth While uncommon in the US HPV can cause laryngeal lesions voice box in the baby Nopregnancy will not have any effect on how much you develop You are as tall as you were going to be and your breasts would most likely have been the same size perhaps smaller Your puberty was not cut short but having a child at an early age sure caused your adolescence to be seriously cut short You were well into puberty when you got pregnant oryou would not have been able to become pregnant in the first place It would not be very likely that you would conceive in this way but to be safe just do a few home pregnancy tests and consider this a lessonlearned This practice is very dangerous sexplay that will eventually lead to intercourse so be prepared Dont be in denial that it will not eventually happen Clearly you are in an intimate relationship so go to Student Health and get on an effective contraceptive pill Depo etc and make that boyfriend of yours use a condomeven if you both have clothes on It is always safer to contain those babycausing sperm on one place If he cant keep them in his testicles then he should at least keep them in a condom Those symptoms justify a medical visit They could signal a hormonal problem that may need further investigation See a cosmetic surgeon and dont waste your time and money on scarremoval creams Large keloidlike scars may be able to be injected with a mild steroid to make them smaller and there are other methods of scar removal like dermabrasion An STD sexuallytransmitted disease is caused by sexual exposure to someone who HAS an STD Since neither one of you have had sex then you are presumed to be STDfree unless someone is not telling the truth The only STD that could be an issue is herpes simplex if one of you has a history of cold soresfever blisters and engages in an activity that could spread this virus to a genital area Sexual play often escalates over time so a word of caution for both of you to be prepared in case your intimacy leads to riskier sex play genital contact or intercourse If you have been off birth control having unprotected sex and now experiencing no period breast pain and nauseathen OF COURSE you could be pregnant There can be certainly be other reasons to account for your array of symptoms but pregnancy would be high on the list and would need to be considered FIRST No You can wear a bra to bed if you like It will not be bad for your breasts As much as I would like to address your concerns I really do not know anything about youyour age medical history or even if you are a female men have breasts too More importantly it would take a thorough examination to determine if this lump is worrisome or not Although I am sympathetic to your lack of insurance an examination is really the only way to make this important call I can tell you that lumps that come and go are more likely to be cysts especially if the lumps are influenced by your menstrual cycle again assuming you are female Breast cancers do not come and gosadly they tend to stay and get bigger over time No doctors are not obligated do do what you wantlike a biopsy that they feel may be unnecessary Your only course of action is to see a different surgeon plead your case and get a second opinion Surgeons do not want to just randomly remove or biopsy masses that may be cystic fibrocystic or clearly not suspicious of cancer You have a cancer fear since these are your breaststhe only ones that you feel The surgeon may have years of experience examining thousands of lumpy breasts and reading many mammograms and does not share in your fear or concern You cannot force a surgeon into the operating room no matter how much you demand You will need to see your doctor to confirm if you have adolescent gyencomastia or not If you do know that this is very commonand it will eventually just go away in the vast number of young men As a matter of fact I have only had one out of thousands of patientsto be referred for corrective surgery It is possible that you just have prominent nipples and not gynecomastia This may not go away so if this is your diagnosis you would have to consider a cosmetic surgery to correct it Try and get your old records to confirm that diagnosisincluding the pathology report To get a breast CANCER at age 13 is extremely rare so I would question the validity of that diagnosis Yes a yeast infection can do this Rather than assume they are both connected you would be wise to see your medical provider for an examination and prescription treatment You do realize that I have no way of examining you correct It would be impossible for any medical professional to make a diagnostic call based solely on the description of a brown colored spot You will need to see a medical professional or dermatologist for a proper examination If her breasts become soretender with her menses having them squeezed to the size of pancake during a mammogram may not be pleasant Have her call the mammogram technician for advice Her period should not affect the accuracy of the test but it can affect her comfort Stress can cause irregular periods and longer bleeding than normal So can hormonal fluctuations It would probably be best to have a gynocologist check things because it can also be a sign of trouble if it goes on for too long At the very lest make sure you are getting enough iron in your diet while you are losing the extra blood its gas You probably need to take your ass to the doctor before you get Alzeimers in your sleep and throw up everywere and dont know what the hell your doing Yes it not unusual to have a period while pregnant I never had that happen to be however i have heard that its not uncommon I would take a pregnancy test and see what it says and if says u arent go to the doctor Is the bleeding like your normal periods First i do like to advice you to wait for the period if you do not see the period go for a home pregnancy test A pregnancy test only reacts to the pregnancy hormone human chorionic gonadotropin HCG However if you are pregnant this hormone will not be present in your urine or blood until 13 to 16 days after ovulation the release of an egg which is around the time that you would normally get your period Until this time has passed it will not be possible to see a positive result in a pregnancy test Source  Pharmacysell no I dont know what preview means but basically it means you have trapped gas or a disease so go strait to the ER emergency room or grab you iPad and go sit up on that toilet And watch out for cats Side effects of a hormonal IUD can include The hormonal IUD can cause hormonal side effects similar to those caused by oral contraceptives  such as breast tenderness mood swings headaches  and acne  This is rare When side effects do happen they usually go away after the first few months More here httpwwwwebmdcomsexbirthcontrolintrauterinedeviceiudforbirthcontrol Those side effects seem similar to what you are describing Please report any side effects to your doctor so you can discuss the next course of action thats right for you Take care Here is some information on and that may help explain whats happening but its always best to give your gynecologist a call and let him or her know whats happening and get checked out You can also find lots of great information on our  The WebMD Answers Staff Only your doctor can tell you if the

find what you need soon The WebMD Answers Staff Ideally its a good idea to introduce the cup to your baby as early as six months though some make the transition even sooner And some make it later  Although every baby is different look for hints that your baby is ready to wean A breastfed baby may Suck on your breast a few times and then stop or even refuse the breast Get distracted easily while breastfeeding Show growing interest in drinking from a cup I would try taking another test to see if it comes out negative You could be but the best way to know is go get a test done Missing your period is certainly a big red flag I would go see a doctor andor take a pregnancy test This might sound silly to you but this happens to my belly button pretty frequently and the best thing Ive found for it is called Boudreauxs Butt Paste its a diaper rash cream that can be found in most grocery stores or walmarts You just spread it on pretty thickly and wait over night and the pain and redness will have decreased and itll be on its way to healing I repeat usage as needed Boudreauxs Butt Paste is completely harmless so it can be used frequently It has a pretty sweet scent but its not unbearable and it certainly beats vinegar Have you been sexually active since stopping your birth control and if so did you use another method of contraception If you havent been sexually active youre not pregnant This sounds like concern and if your HPTs have been negative your best bet is to get to a physician and find out whats going on What is the pain like Is it consistent or does it come and go Is it sharp and stabbing or dull and achy Does it feel like menstrual cramps Given its location above your belly button it could be bloating or gas Does it change if you move your bowels and are you still moving them regularly More specifics would help a betterdefined answer Last time this happen to me I was pregnant  Try a pregnancy test SOME PEOPLE NEED BLOOD TEST TO DETIRMINE PREGNANCY

Warm wishes Marty lilpond YES Go to a doctor  now If you cant afford a mammogram let me know and I will get you in contact with a place to get one for free  I am not a doctor but I get the same thing  my doc told me its trapped gasI bought aloe vera juice  you take 4 ounces  it hhelps alotTass just like water thats why I take it LOL you have to get it fro a health food storeHope this helpsTami  Of course youre safe Who ever heard of getting an STD AT A MASSAGE PARLOR you may have a rib out u could just need your back popped I would wait a few more days and see if you get your period If you cant wait then get an early response test The further from your period due date the less certain your results will be Try waiting to test at the most 2 days before your expected period The date that you had sex is around when you probably ovulated so you could be pregnant Only time will tell good luck It could just be the way the baby is lying Sounds like you could be going through menopause Either way you should get a check up by your gyno and rule out some things You should probably give your doctor a call You may not have all the symptoms but I would think the breast thing would be one so there my be something else serious that could be going on You may want to take another test and also see your doctor I had this same burning sensation for years I was later diagnosed with DCIS Ductal carcinoma in situ Make sure you are getting regular mammograms to be safeWhen caught early I was able to have a lumpectomy and radiation onlyThe cancer is in the milk ducts only with this diagnosis This is definitely a symptom that can be covered by a lot of different diagnosis Ive also experienced pain there At first I thought maybe I was smoking too much or that my ADHD meds were giving me some kind of side affect I think to figure out how serious it is you have to think about your own medical history Do you have asthma If so it could just be a little swelling around the lungs that isnt typically too harmful You should also check on the possible side affects of all of your medications If you have a history of heart disease or heart attacks then I would pay special attention to whether your left arm I believe is going numb If you feel like it is probably an emergency go straight to the ER  If you feel like you can wait to see your PCP then its definitely something you should bring up during your appointment They can have you tested for many things which of course usually leads to a more definitive understanding of what is or could be wrong I have a question for you on this one How often does she go to this doctor Does she have a family history of breast cancer I think if he is checking more than once a month then he may be trying to cop a feel However if its once a month or less and theres a family history then I would agree that hes just being thorough I think if youre a week and a half late then I would go ahead and take a test If it comes out negative and the symptoms persist then I would go to your doctor and discuss it with himher Yes I would go to the ER if the pain is worse Do you have any other symptoms When did the pain start ive had 2 etopic pregnancies and ever since then i have been getting missed periods also late periods and i have gladly thought at the time that yes its a miracle and then sadness because my period was just late Now i truly believe in miracles especially if you only had one tubal pregnancy and still have the other tube intact yes you can become pregnent again but be careful your pregnancies are considered high risk so make sure that if you come out positive in a test go see your GYN immediately and explain your tragedy and he will take it from there my mistake was not seeking medical attention immediately after finding that im pregnant again and it turned out to be another tubal but miracles do happen just strongly believe in it Good Luck and God Bless As a layperson but with experience I highly recommend avoiding hormones as they can lead to cancer and estrogen based cancer has occurred in people I know Depending on your age and reason please defer to your doctors as it is very serious You didnt mention how old you are but when it comes to stress any age is a possibilityStress can cause you to miss periods but it could be something other than stressId get it checked out have they been around anyone new recently do they have new or sudden fears of people and places they were normally comfortable with what do they look like size Round or irregular shape what color How did they go away before Swelling or an internal bruise may be the cause for your pain and discomfort May I ask Have you missed your period lately  Could be possible of a sign of pregnancy some women have light diacharge during pregnancy But sometimes is a sign of ur period Buy a pregnancy test or see a doctor to make sure Every womens body ia different yes because i was You might have scolioisis That is a symptom where your spine curves to one side at a certain angle I had it for 3 years and had to wear a brace It can cause pain you may have fatty tissues You should know that thinking for breast reconstruction is not a bad thing but if you are thinking to do so then you must know that u should use all natural methods for growing your breastMany women go for breast implants and after some time they go back to their initial state and suffer lotSo u should always try to go for natural breast enhancement methods to be in safe side are you sure you are not pregnant in my thoughts it either pregnancy or breast cancer some home pregnancy test can be inaccurate Also it can be late for the test to be positive take the test too late can cause the test to be negative because of the hormones that how most home test or all home pregnancy test works by the pregnancy hormones you should go to your dr for a blood pregnancy test they are more accurate and some women get negative results from home pregnancy tests You should definitely be tested for pregnancy as no protection is 100 effective and your symptoms can be related to pregnancy You can get pregnant at any time Take a test problem wsupportive tissue Sounds to me like you are ovulating I would take a test to make sure but I bet you are good I usually see my period every 30days it always shows up on the 27th of every monthbut december last year it did not show upi got couple of signs that come and gojanuary 6th this year it showed upflowed heavily the first and second day the other days it was lightfebruary this year i started having pains in my nipplesfrequent discharge thought i was pregnant but on the 16th it cameheavily the first two days and then stopped the 3rd day and came again the 4th dayam seriously have pains on my left lower side of my womband also having abdominal painplease am i pregnant It is possible Those tests arent always 100 accurate Id see a doctor to be absolutely sure I hope you get to have a child soon I took a HPT and it came back neg Today is actually day 24 of my cycle and I noticed light pink blood when I wipe I have a regular cycle of 28 days and my period comes on time every month Im not expecting my period until 619 Being that I tested neg and that Im bleeding could this be implantation bleeding or is this my period  You need to take a test and call your GYN Sounds like you are PG  You could be pregnant but the best advice I can give you is GO SEE YOUR DOCTOR My best advice is one go get the heart murmur test done and do some research to find out if anyone in your family either have or died from a heart condition And also find out if anyone has asthma in your family It is certainly possible Since you have a history of miscarriages I would reconmend you go see your OBGYN as soon as possible to find out That way if you are your doctor can monitor you closely to help prevent another miscarriage if possibleGood luck and God bless its possibleonly 99 effectivebest to take a test just for good measure none I have not missed my period yet So I am playing the waiting game now I guess A ptest can turn up negative if you are prego but will never come up positive if you are not prego So you very well may be prego but your body might not be producing enough of whatever it is that tells the test yes you are Try taking a test in a few more days or a week It takes about 14 days after the egg is fertilized to show up on a test yes for sure take a test and consult an OB GYN GOOD LUCK nopain is on my left side  Hope this helps but I would make an appointment with an OBGYNI have a friend that had a tubal ligation done and she did become pregnant Problem was the egg was still in her tube She had very little cramping only reason she went to the doctor is because she has never been even a day late so she got worried when she was two weeks late  I had my period November 10th but I didnt get it in December at all and the Pregnancy test came back negative Should I go and see my doctor or just wait to see if I get my period this month please let me know I am writing this for a friend of mine thanks for the help Take a hpt and then follow up with your Gyn sounds like pulled muscle strain if the pain persists after your menstrual cycle and more than two weeks with no workouts consult your doctor It could be a variety of things the test may have been false positive To be on the safe side i would urge you to see a doctor and explain all symtoms to them Above all remain calm and dont stress yourself out it will all be ok It stays in the whole time I go see my doctor in the am to find out exactly whats wrong with me I have read that it could be a number of things and not be pregnancy related Ill post back Yes You should still be tested just to be sure A pregnancy should be detected asap I would buy one of those pregnancy tests and try it I hope you arent pregnant but you need to find out what is going on Do a pregnancy test and then go to a doctor Best wishes for a speedy recovery Theres always a chance everything can go wrong  you could be pregnant However you seem to have done everything you could to avoid it Sore breasts can be from new contraceptive pills Also pill could change period cycles I am on a progesterone only pill and havent had a period since I started these pills about 9 or 10 years ago I would ask a health care professional or someone from Planned Parenthood Try not to worry too much because it sounds like you did everything right But I know how easy it is to become paranoid I would try clearblue pregnancy test because they claim to be able to roughly date pregnancy as well as predict it But any brand name will work Best wishes  I dont think you are pregnant well male or female we both have the same tissues in our breasts and just like women males can create milk i would def go to the doctor you see green stuff green always means infection  caused by what i dont know but your doctor should know what tests to run to help you for now i think it good to put a cold compress on it as cold kills bacteira ad should help with the pain  hope everythings okay everyone different but really its supply and demand tell her to uptake in the amount of times shes pumping even if she gets nothing it will tell her body that more is needed also make sure she has a good diet and is drinking plenty of water with my son my milk one day just kinda went away id say 2 months into it its also good to have the baby take the milk no only the pump a mothers phyical conneation to her baby will help its more powerful than many people think i hope this helps good luck and congrats on the baby well you could always have the doctor do a basic blood test to rule out infection because your white blood count would tell if infection is present  also 55 is a pretty normal age for the change of life  have you seen your gyn i think thats a good thing to bring up her  she can help rule out what it is and if it is the change of life she can help you try things to make it less of a problem in your everyday life hope this helped  did you find out what the problem was I am dealing with the same pain I would ask you if you have been under a great deal of stress recently It sounds like the pain most people get from having an ulcer If you have been under a lot of stress it is quite possible that you have an ulcer in your intestines causing the pain I recommend talking to your doctor and asking if you should have an upper GI test done If you have ulcers you can cure them by taking Slipper Elm Bark pills found at your local natural foods store One per day should be good unless you have more than one ulcer If this is the case take one with each meal for a couple of weeks for either doseage I recommend the pills over surgery If you cant swallow pills the stuff comes in a pwder form that you can mix into a hot beverage or put in a food that can mask the taste It does not have a pleasant flavor yes u could go see a doctor to be for sure I have what sounds like the exact same thing I ended up going to one of the free clinics sponsored by the cancer center for breast cancer awareness and got it looked at even an ultrasound done on it They said that it is not a real concern unless it were a hard lump and ultrasound confirmed it was just a random buildup of fat and tissue I have had mine for about 4years now still there and still the same size If it were to change in size or get hard then I would definitely get it looked at again Im a redneck country boy With enough since and kids to let you know that Yeap you could be Pregnant That you should have been hog tied and burnt because the tubes can come untied you need a hormone that your body is not creating talk to your DR i do not know the answer i am trying to figure it out myself every 3 hours  NOHARD I m 29 and the problem started when I was 22 i guess At first it was just the breasts but now its effecting the whole body I never mixed it in the same bottle but I would nurse him then give him to his father to finish feeding with a bottle and it never caused him any troubles Plus I think it helped move him faster to a cup because he stopped nursing and bottle at six months and moved on to a sippy cup I had a similar issue No hysterectomy but no reason to be leaking either never had kids not pregnant I did some research and found that any sort of leakage without force ie squeezing or pulling on the nipple was cause for concern Especially when it is coming from just one side Mine came from both at different times Also the color of the liquid is an important factor a milky or clear liquid is of less concern than green or blood I found that many women with high prolactin levels had that as a symptom and can be cause by birth control or a small non cancerous tumor that is treated with medication I went to the doctor and sure enough my prolactin was highthis is an ongoing story since I have my first endocrinologist appointment next week but at least I know why I finally did something about it when my breasts became sore and sensitive for no reason Go see an obgyn or an internist Even if you dont have insurance I didntI do now its worth the 200 or so dollars FYImine also came with weight gain without being able to lose itso the sooner the better No woman wants that My Doctor told me vitamin E and evening primrose oil are good for breast health They also work for tenderness You could have an ectopic pregnancy which can be life threatening It takes on the symptoms of early pregnancy You need to go to an obgyn and have them check for it Its not fun but it can save your lifeor just give you definite answers There are free clinics like planned parenthood that have well trained doctors if you dont have insurance your period might be irregular You need to talk to your mom or an adult you trust Dont let this wait There are lots of reasons other than cancer for lumps but early detection is the best And yes I am a breast cancer survivor I have had the same prob i was told was an infecton in your bodyif not treated properaly could turn into a staff infectionyou will need to see a doctor and get antibiodicsbacterial kind and simply change a few thingssuch as do not share towleswash clothesrazors and toothbrush with any one elseand use antbacteril sopehope this helped Estrogencontaining contraceptives have been linked to low milk supply and a shorter duration of breastfeeding even when started when baby is older after milk supply is well established Not all mothers who take contraceptives containing estrogen will experience a low milk supply but these unaffected mothers appear to be a very small minority For most mothers progestinonly forms of contraception do not cause problems with milk supply if started after the 6th8th week postpartum and if given at normal doses However there are many reports most anecdotal but nevertheless worth paying attention to that some women do experience supply problems with these pills so if you choose this method you still need to proceed with some caution Progestinonly contraceptives come in several different forms the progestinonly pill POP also called the minipill Micronor Errin NorQD Ovrette Microval etc the birth control injection Depo Provera the progesteronereleasing IUD Mirena Progestasert the birth control implant Norplant Implanon Here is the link for where I got this information from httpkellymomcombfcanibreastfeedmedsbirthcontrol if i touch it it hurts even worse I woke up a lot last night because it hurt so bad get a mammogram ASAP to rule out cancer See your doctor too might be an infection too um it was pretty close to a normal one maybe a day or so shorter but since then now i havent had my period since then so idk if its because i have had my period twice in one month or what but i plan on getting a test if i dont get my period within another week Yesget tested for pregnancy at least to rule it out When I conceived my children I felt as though I would start my period but never did so yes I was cramping which I believe is just the Zygote attaching to your uterine wall and is common I believe At least it was for me Sounds to me like you were ovulating on day 11 and 12 and if you had unprotected intercourse and now feeling the symptoms of pregnancy Id go get tested Sounds to me like you just encountered the same situation I did when I conceived my first child I know the exact date of her conception because of this Just her breast If you do not usually get period due to your medications I would honestly advice getting blood work done and an ultrasound from you OBGYN It sounds like you have all the symptoms of early pregnancy I hope this helps Best of luck 3 ounces 3 ounces If the baby under 6 month old only breast milk usually suggested Sperm can swim Male sperm are fast and furious while Female sperm are slower but live longer and stick around longer If your cervical mucus is thin and stretchy and if you arent using excessive lubricants I am positive that not penetrating deeply is no problem at all In fact some experts associate less deep ejaculations with female children as the male sperm die before reaching their destination Stomach pain as in the actual organ Your stomach is on the upper left side Stretches core strengthening exercises visit a chiropractor get a massage If you get a massage try to do something with hot stones I already posted it negative with infection and it neg for pregnant I already talk
