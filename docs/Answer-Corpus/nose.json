to coordinate the care of thyroid cancer Follicular thyroid cancer involves several different steps and an endocrinologist will be able to guide your treatment program so that at each stage you see the most appropriate consultant The first step in the treatment of suspected follicular thyroid cancer is a total or neartotal thyroidectomy This type of operation can be tricky and you want to make sure you are referred to a surgeon with a lot of experience in thyroid surgery Once the thyroid is removed the diagnosis of follicular thyroid cancer must be confirmed This type of thyroid cancer unlike the more common thyroid cancer papillary thyroid cancer cannot be accurately diagnosed by a fine needle aspiration This is the procedure when a doctor puts a needle into a thyroid nodule and draws out some cells Fine needle aspiration can only be used to diagnose a follicular tumor A follicular tumor may be either benign or cancerous A surgical specimen is required to determine that the tumor is cancerous and has the ability to spread to other sites When the diagnosis of follicular thyroid cancer is confirmed surgically and the thyroid has been removed the next step in the treatment is radioactive iodine I131 This is used to kill off any remaining thyroid cancer cells Once the thyroid has been removed and destroyed scans and blood tests can be used to check for recurrence After surgery and radioiodine ablation thyroid cancer patients are given thyroid hormone replacement to replace the hormone and prevent any thyroid growth An endocrinologist will be able to support you through this entire process High blood pressure hypertension causes heart disease which might explain your chest pains shortness of breath and fatigue When the heart is unable to pump blood efficiently shortness of breath occurs as does fatigue Fatigue is also a very common side effect of many medications used to treat high blood pressure Nosebleeds can also be caused by hypertension High blood pressure causes blood to leak out of the tiny blood vessels in the nose Unfortunately most people who have hypertension do not have symptoms That is why hypertension is called the silent killer because the seriousness of this disease is not appreciated until hypertension has done damage to organs Your symptoms warrant immediate attention from a doctor It is very important that your blood pressure be adequately controlled and that tests be done to evaluate your heart I am on oxygen at night and I am also take a sleeping pill I have a bottle of water on my machine and I still wake

persist or worsen I dont suspect syncope either Your pulse rate was within normal limits and your blood pressure was somewhat elevated With syncope the victim often feels faint the pulse may be rapid and the blood pressure is typically lower due to a lack of oxygen going to the brain The syncope patient may also lose consciousness What causes syncope as a symptom Stress intense exercise sudden standing after sitting or lying down certain medications dehydration physical exhaustion heart condition problems and other reasons I would start out with a visit to the family doctor who can get the

infectionYour daughter most likely has either a viral or bacterial infection Some causes for the symptoms could be Strep Throat Sinusitis Bacterial Pneumonia the Common Cold and even Allergies The usual childhood fever range is from 100 degrees F to 104 degrees F Most childhood fevers are not dangerous and last for 23 days Treat your daughter with extra fluids and acetaminophen to reduce the fever Wearing less clothing and applying a light blanket for chills can also be beneficial When to call the doctor When in doubt it is better to err on the side of caution and call the doctor for instructions on treating your daughter The doctor should always be contacted for fevers exceeding 105 degrees F fevers lasting more than 3 days if your daughter appears to look very ill the fever went away for a day or so and then returned or you have questions or concerns I hope that this answer has been helpful and that your daughter gets well soon The nose acts as a filter to capture dirt and pollutants before entering the lungs Below are the usual reasons that a sore within the nose occurs Hi there Kico It could be seasonal allergy Rhinitis It occurs at the time of season changes and people easily get such symptoms So you need to treat it by having medicines like Allegra Such seasonal allergies are caused due to dust and pollen etc So to treat it you may opt for Allegra which is effective nonsedating antihistamine medicine that is intended to be used to treat for relieving allergy symptoms such as hay fever itchy eyes runny nose and others Allegra is easily available on online drug pharmacy Drugpillstore Have you seen a pulminologist It sounds like coughvariant asthma My son has this form of asthma the asthma meds help control the coughing I forgot to mention my sons xrays are always clear and he rarely ever wheezes But he does have asthma I have seen improvements from being on different inhalers Although we are still trying to figure out how severe his case is since even prednisone doesnt fix the cough now For your any dental problem plz click here  confidentdentalcare  It might have been 85 degrees partly cloudy with a slight breeze in Southeast Texas I loved it one friend started to sweat another just agreed that it was hot It could be a sinus infection  But if there is no other signs The best way to remove blackheads is to have a dermatologist do it They use a small instrument called a comedone extractor Also RetinA and Differin are two potent antiblackhead comedolytic prescriptions available Discs with glycolic and salicylic acid are also helpful in preventing comedones aka blackheads from forming What did she eatShe may have an allergic reactionWhen she sleeps keep her head propped up so she dont risk the chance of choking Dermal fillers are generally used to fix those nose to mouth lines That would be from here to here and those are call nasolabial folds What I found though sometimes is that some people ask for fillers in this area but they have really lost volumes in the temples or in other areas in the face and putting too much filler in that area can create too much fullness without making them look younger and it doesnt always look natural So you need to have a conversation with your dermatologist about what your concerns are and they can point out to you ways in which you can soften your overall expression in a very natural way By volumizing the skin and the face in a way that has balance and harmony Because we have so many new products to use between Sculptra and hyaluronic acids and Radiesse and Evolence we have really great products to use and sometimes we use more than one product in the same person in order to achieve that overall natural result But this is a complete conversation that you need to have with your aesthetic physician which would be dermatologist or plastic surgeon to see what the right treatment is for you I would recommend evaluation by a dermatologist When there is a dark line along the bridge top of the nose it is often due to allergies and rubbing the nose The goldstandard skin brightener is hydroquinone The typical prescriptionstrength products contain 4 hydroquinone It can be irritating to your skin though so your dermatologist will review if this is the right treatment for you and how it should be used for your condition Overthecounter products can contain up to 2 hydroquinone but I believe this ingredient should only be used under the supervision of your dermatologist The bumps could be something called sebaceous hyperplasia which can be a sign of rosacea and appear in greater numbers in those who have regular sun exposure and alcohol intake Your dermatologist can evaluate to define the condition and treat with simple treatments such as creams or inoffice treatments such as electrodessication or laser treatments Chances are your dog just likes to lick your nose and ears Its unlikely that the dog is doing so because there is any kind of health problem Im sorry to hear youre experiencing this As a veteran of skin rashes I can relate This is probably not an emergency room situation Save the ER for those times when you experience chest pain or difficulty breathing A scaly itchy rash on the face can be caused by many things including eczema a likely culprit and psoriasis The only way to tell for sure is to get a physical exam from your primary care provider If the diagnosis is eczema or psoriasis your PCP will be able to tell you how to treat it Id be cautious using Caladryl calamine lotion near the eyes If it gets in your eyes it can cause irritation If you have no known drug allergies you may apply some overthecounter hydrocortisone cream temporarily until you can see your doctor Keep in mind though you want the rash to be visible when you visit your health care provider So take some good photos of it before you use any treatments Best to you Boy do I hear you  because I have the same thing Some people simply have a chronically runny nose Usually the fluid is clear and thin This condition is called   This means your runny nose isnt related to any allergic cause If eating spicy or hot foods makes this problem worse the medical term for it is gustatory rhinitis or gustatory rhinorrhea Either way theres no cure Theres no cure for nonallergic rhinitis either If youve tried overthecounter pills and prescription nasal sprays without relief Im not sure what to suggest More hankies Sorry I cant be of more help but at least take comfort in knowing youre not alone About 20 million Americans suffer from nonallergic rhinitis Take care Im sorry to hear youre going through this It sounds very unpleasant A viral infection such as the common cold can last as long as 14 days though most people only experience symptoms for up to a week So its possible this is a virus On the other hand it could be a sinus infection Ive heard patients describe a crushing sensation with sinus infections No matter whats causing your symptoms I think after a week of suffering through them you deserve a diagnosis Id suggest visiting your primary care provider to see whats going on If its something that can be treated with antibiotics then youll get a prescription and should feel better within days after starting on the meds If you do receive a prescription for antibiotics be sure to take the entire course of pills Do not stop taking them just because you begin feeling better This is very important Youve done the right thing by trying to treat the symptoms with overthecounter products but obviously that hasnt helped I hope youll now seek medical attention Youve earned it All the best to you Certainly arent uncommon in children A few drops every now and then isnt unusual As to cause its difficult to tell If this happens more in the winter then Id say its perhaps due to dry air You can try a cool air humidifier in the boys bedroom to see if that helps Also a waterbased lubricant like plain KY jelly applied sparingly to the nostril with a swab before bedtime can help If the nosebleeds persist you may want to take the boy to his pediatrician for an evaluation Hope this helps If your doctor put you on a lowdose aspirin regimen I would urge you not to discontinue it without your doctors approval Your health care provider wouldnt put you on an aspirin regimen unless he or she believed you needed it If youre experiencing undesirable side effects like the bruising and bleeding issues please make an appointment to discuss these with your health care provider because he or she needs to know that this is happening Your doctor may want to take you off aspirin lower the dose or put you on a different medication altogether If on the other hand you started taking daily aspirin on your own because youve read it might be good for you or help prevent a heart attack or something then you probably are OK to stop Going to an everyotherday regimen is a great way to taper off the dose Do that for a week then go to every second day for a week and so on until youre down to once a week At that point you can stop I want to make a point that no one should selfmedicate for heart concerns with aspirin whether lowdose or regular strength Blood thinning should be done only under the supervision of a health care provider Also when a person is on an aspirin regimen he or she should be aware of overthecounter supplements such as fish oil and Vitamin E that also have bloodthinning properties Taking too many or too much of these products can cause the bleeding and bruising problems you describe I hope this helps Im not sure why you believe youre leaking cerebrospinal fluid CSF from your nose but if you truly are you need to seek immediate medical attention CSF leakage from the nose certainly can occur after trauma such as from a car accident CSF is a colorless fluid that circulates throughout the spinal cord and brain In fact this fluid actually helps cushion the brain like a shock absorber A nasal CSF leak due to trauma is considered a serious problem because you can get meningitis inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain easily A nasal CSF leak can occur due to tears in the tissue surrounding the brain These tears must be surgically repaired If you havent received medical attention for this problem please do so immediately This type of problem definitely warrants a trip to the emergency room I hope you feel better after your accident You need to call your pediatrician as soon as possible to let them know about these symptoms in your baby It could be that he simply has a common cold but you dont take chances with an infant If your baby begins turning blue around the lips or under his nails or if he is running a fever as measured rectally you should seek emergency treatment by calling 911 Otherwise just try to get an appointment with your pediatrician as soon as possible Please review this list of  which provides excellent guidance Meanwhile its very important you keep your son well hydrated by making sure he nurses regularly Do not give an infant water Keep an eye on how wet his diapers are and if you notice his urine output decreasing you again need to seek emergency medical treatment for him Use a suction bulb to remove mucus from his nasal passages to help him breathe better and keep a close eye on him when hes sleeping Here are some more excellent tips for  I hope your son gets better soon Any time an infant or toddler eats or drinks something that is not made for human consumption you should call the poison control hotline at  Write that phone number down and post it on your refrigerator for easy access You should call your pediatrician for advice about your childs fever and runny nose Its doubtful the plant food caused this but we are into flu season and flu can be very serious in a oneyearold You need to get this situation assessed as soon as possible If your baby is not eating or drinking take him to the emergency room If your baby is not producing a wet diaper at least every 3 hours get him to the emergency room Plant food contains various chemicals that are highly unsafe for anyone to consume eatdrink These things also are unsafe for your pets to drink so you should find a way to prevent them from doing so Perhaps place a mesh cover over the Christmas tree bowl so they cannot reach the water or something Wishing you well Sorry to hear of this Dealing with a constantly runny nose can be very annoying The medical term for a runny nose is  The runnyness is caused by inflammation of the nasal tissue The most common type of rhinitis is allergic rhinitis However its possible to have the nonallergic variety too Another flavor of rhinitis is called gustatory rhinitis and this refers to getting a runny nose when you eat Other things can cause a runny nose such as exposure to cold weather If youve never been diagnosed with nasal allergies this would be a good time to see your health care provider to determine if your runny nose is caused by allergies or not If it is an overthecounter or prescription medication may help dry up your nasal tissue If your runny nose is not caused by allergies then your only option may be to invest in a lot of tissue Not the best news I know Hope this helps Im sorry youre dealing with this The issue of methicillinresistant Streptococcus aureaus infection continues to grow as a public health concern As youve learned it can take multiple rounds of antibiotics to treat MRSA Because only the infected spot on your nose is itching I doubt what youre experiencing is a side effect of medication I guess my point is its impossible to say whats causing the itching and tingling without a physical examination If youre scheduled for followup with your health care provider you are probably safe to take a waitandsee approach with this as long as you dont develop a fever or additional symptoms increased rednessswellingheat at the infection site feeling like youre coming down with the flu  that sort of thing If you dont already have a followup appointment scheduled Id suggest making one You and your doctor want to be sure that infection is well and truly gone In the meantime be sure against spreading any possible remaining infection by washing your hands often and thoroughly not sharing towels or clothing that may have touched the infected spot and routinely disinfecting routinely touched surfaces by using antimicrobial wipes or something similar I hope this helps Im sorry youre going through this It sounds unnerving Unfortunately theres no way to diagnose this problem without doing a physical exam Many things could cause such swelling from a serious sinus infection to an abscessed tooth Your best bet is to contact your health care provider for an appointment as soon as possible If you begin to have severe pain or start running a fever over 101F then you may want to consider visiting an urgent care facility to get this checked out I wish you all the best and hope you feel better soon The best advice I can give you is to go back to your piercer They have specialized tools to help remove these piercings safely Its not likely the piercing has become ingrown Its much more likely the darn thing is just stuck However if there is a problem with the piercing your piercer should be able to recommend a course of action If you get infections around the piercing Id suggest you see your primary health care provider These infections can turn serious and its lucky yours have all cleared up Hope this helps Anyone taking who is experiencing frequent severe nosebleeds should treat this as a serious medical issue and seek treatment quickly Warfarin is a blood thinner Its often used to prevent blood clots in people at high risk However thinning the blood too much can cause serious side effects such as stroke Thats why you have to go to the Coumadin clinic once a week to have your clotting factors checked Id recommend you contact your prescribing physician as soon as possible to alert him or her to your frequent severe nosebleeds Wishing you all the best Good question At least it sounds like youve been able to isolate the condition as occurring only in your own house Thats a start in trying to figure out whats going on A couple of possibilities spring to mind First is dry air Lack of humidity can cause all the symptoms you describe and is common in regions where people run the furnace in the winter At the other end of the spectrum is mold Im not necessarily talking about toxic black mold but rather the more common mold and mildew that occur in humid climates If your house feels dank or if you see mold growing beneath the kitchen sink or in other areas that could be the source of your symptoms How about allergies Are you allergic to cats Did the previous tenant of your house own one or more cats If so you could be having an allergic reaction to the cats that used to inhabit your house Other allergies could be at the root of this anything from grass or plants maybe theres some particular tree or bush growing outside your window that gives you an allergic reaction to formaldehyde in the carpeting If you can find an environmental cause such as dry air or mold you can take steps to mitigate the problem Either humidify the air or get rid of the mold If this is some sort of allergic reaction it may be much harder to pinpoint the cause In that case your only option may be to move out of the house Sorry youve been suffering and hope you can figure out the root cause soon Im hoping you meant to type 102 degree fever because 112 degrees would send most people into seizure and death Im sorry youre going through this It sounds like you are absolutely miserable While I cannot diagnose you via internet I will say you are describing the classic  Fever coughing weakness and general misery are the hallmarks of influenza Unfortunately at day 4 its too late to get the antiviral flu treatment On the plus side if this is a case of the flu the fever should go away over the next 24 hours or so If your fever continues beyond the 4th day you should seek medical attention as soon as possible as this could be a sign of something serious going on To your question The maximum daily dose of as set by the US Food and Drug Administration FDA is 1200mg per day You will have to check the label of your bottle to see how many milligrams of ibuprofen are contained in each gelcap youre taking Divide 1200mg by the amount in one capsule to find how many gelcaps you generally can safely take per day You need to be careful not to take any other cough and cold preparations that also contain ibuprofen Even some branded Tylenol products may contain other active ingredients like ibuprofen so read the labels carefully Meanwhile be sure to drink plenty of fluids I hope you feel better soon But if you dont be sure to seek medical attention Well its impossible to say what has caused your red spots without an examination but I wouldnt jump right to staph So many things can cause flaky red patches on the face including as you pointed out eczema If gentle cleansing and applying skin lotion or cream doesnt help you might get it checked out by a doctor just to be safe This illustrates common adult skin conditions though it doesnt include a picture of a staph infection of the skin I hope the patches clear up soon You were wise to get this situation checked out because it is possible for a person to leak cerebrospinal fluid CSF through a nostril and this is a dangerous situation that can lead to a serious infection of the membranes that surround the brain However since youve had a battery of tests done that have shown the fluid leaking from your nose is not CSF then you can rest assured your brain is fine The fluid coming from your nose must be normal  Many people myself included suffer from a chronically runny nose Clear fluid coming from the nose can indeed be caused by allergies There also is an interesting condition called gustatory rhinitis which is fancy talk for getting a runny nose while eating Since your runny nose comes and goes it does sound like it could be seasonal allergies Only your health care providers can solve this mystery for you I wish you all the best I know you believe the problem is sinus drainage but has anyone evaluated you for acid reflux I mention this because people especially those with sinus problems often believe they are constantly coughing up nasal drainage when actually theyre coughing up stomach acid You can test this theory yourself by taking an overthecounter antacid for a few days to see if it helps the problem A lot of people arent aware stomach acid can move all the way up the esophagus into the posterior portion of the mouth especially when sleeping Sometimes acid reflux is actually diagnosed by a dentist who notices substantial erosion of the molars caused by stomach acid If the antacid helps or if you can correlate a pattern of phlegm with food intake you might take up the acid reflux idea with your health care provider during your next visit Wishing you well The passage way from your nostrils is connected with your throat This is why when you laugh and drink milk at the same time it comes out of your nose When you force air pressure through your nose to blow the mucus out it also can come out of your mouth for more and cure you can visit on wwwglobalbgcbwebscom Walmart in the OTC medications aisle Walgreens or any box store Would be stocked with other creams such as Neosporin etc MY MOUTH IS VERY BITTER WHAT CAUSES THAT sounds like sinus problems to metime to see a dr Try to freeze it off with DrScholls Freeze Away Repeat several times It works I removed one close to my eye It takes a couple weeks to disappear completely The first thing you need to know is what is causing the nose bleeds A nose bleed lasting 30 to 45 minutes and losing a great deal of blood can be serious You need to know why you are having them it could be for a numbe of reasons and many are for minor reasons but you do need answers as to what is causing them I assume you know to tile your head bak and try to stop or at least slow the bleeding down If you have used a saline spray often and for years it could simply be that you have irritated the inside lining and membrane of the nose and its causing your bleeding I know a simple saline spray is basically harmless but if it is drying out and irritating the lining and membranes of the nasal canal you need to refrain from using it at all until you see your physician you could probably be smiling less or frowning more If you notice a frown on your face when you feel your face drooping thats probably the cause Ive had sinus problems most of my adult life and I feel for you First of all if youre blowing out clear junk rather than yellow or green mucus you probably dont have a sinus infection  at least not yet  Young babies in day care or preschool can get colds around 3 to 10 times per year with each cold lasting up to 2 or 3 weeks which may feel like all the time They can certainly start getting sick even at a month or two of age Virus infections may also happen when a baby is teething Its unusual however for babies to have allergies before 9 months of age and some experts feel kids dont have seasonal allergies until closer to 2 or 3 years old  If your baby doesnt have a fever and seems to be fine except for the noisy breathing its probably nothing to worry about But if the stuffy nose interferes with sleep or feeding or if he seems to be in pain be sure to have your doctor check him out Thanks for checking in You should definitely be concerned because if your husband sucks up mucus from his nostrils and the mucus gets into the lungs then it can cause some serious health problems For one thing the mucus line builds up narrowing the air paths that the lungs need to take in air and take out carbon dioxide And when that happens it becomes hard or even impossible to breathe Nasal spray does help but it also helps to blow your nose So good luck Its not abnormal I have had it happen to me as well It is uncomfortable but not concerning Remember that vomit comes up the esophagus which is connected to the nose and the mouth If there is enough force the vomit can come out of the nose Try a little vaseline on a cotton swab and swab inside his nose before bed If his nose is feeling dried out it may be itchy and hopefully this will help Also if dryness is the problem a humidifier might help as well Any pharmacy should have this You could try an Apothecary also That actually could be normal But one of the questions I have for this particular patient is whether or not theyre using the spray the right way With many of the sprays its important that you follow the directions that are included in the packaging and that you tilt your head the right way Sometimes if the head is tilted too forward its gonna run out The other thing is too is that maybe their nasal tissue is actually irritated A lot of people dont realize that constant use of sprays and topical products can make the tissue a little sensitive and that might be the reason why theyre getting the runny nose So it might be time for a little bit of a break let the tissue heal a little bit and then we can possibly restart therapy But once again its really important that they let you know their pharmacist know about this is whats going on because we may be able to say to them Yes this is a common side effect and Lets go over your technique again or the pharmacist might say You know what Its time to go back to your doctor or healthcare provider to revisit it and lets see if theres something else that could be given Vaporizers are great as well as humidifiers they actually create a water mist into the room which will help with congestion There are no overthecounter medications approved for a child that young You can use saline drops in the babys nose to loosen up the mucus and use a nasal aspirator to help remove it You can also run a vaporizer in the babys bedroom which will help put moisture in the air and aid with congestion We have to remember that children are not little adults and we have to be very careful about medications If you are not sure ask your pharmacist we are happy to help This is a good question because Benadryl is not a nasal decongestant and will do nothing for the stuffy nose not to mention this medication should not be given to a child this young You want to use saline drops to help thin out the mucus in the nose and then use a nasal aspirator to help clear the passageway I also recommend running a vaporizer in the babys bedroom  that usually helps a lot as well for congestion Parents need to be very careful about cough and cold medications in infants and children so take the time to talk to your pharmacist The most important piece of information that I need to know is how old is the child and how much does he weigh I will also need to know what other medications you may have given him I would recommend Tylenol or an acetaminophen product to start for the headache I would also ask a few more questions about the sinus pressure to define it more Benadryl is OK but I would probably recommend a Claritin or Zyrtectype product because they work longer and have less side effects Benadryl is not a nasal decongestant and will do nothing for the stuffy nose not to mention this medication should not be given to a child this young You want to use saline drops to help thin out the mucus in the nose and then use a nasal aspirator to help clear the passageway I also recommend running a vaporizer in the babys bedroom  that usually helps a lot as well for congestion Parents need to be very careful about cough and cold medications in infants and children so take the time to talk to your pharmacist I am NOT a Dr but I have experienced severe head trauma  surgery If you have insurance or can afford it I would highly recommend seeing a neurologist  having an MRI or Cat Scan Just to be on the safe side  for your own reassurance RIP guy thats fking gonna die soon I cant respond to the medical issue but you can go to a local urgent care center to get care if youre uninsured Warts can sometimes be difficult to treat Given that the wart is on your face it would be best to see a dermatologist for treatment If you are not satisfied with your current doctor seek out a second opinion on treatment It may be that in your situation repeated treatments are needed It should be fine to just put her head in for a few sec at a time She doesnt want to keep her head wet for very long I had a bad car wreck and I did it and dried the area off real well and it was fine Nasal spray decongestants should not be used for more than three days This is because they work by shrinking the mucous membranes in the nose in order to open the airways When it wears off the mucous membranes swell up again making it hard to breathe without using the spray again Over time this can cause someone to rely on the sprays in order to breathe properly through their nose Nasal spray decongestants are safe to use if used as directed and are quite effective at relieving congestion without systemic side effects but it is important to limit their use to no more than three days You may be suffering from rosacea Your dermatologist will be able to make the final determination Topical antibiotics and tretinoin containing compounds will help control oil production and increase cell turnover Aloe vera has been used for centuries as a folk medicine for many purposes Mainly it was used topically on the skin There has been some evidence that it can help in some types of skin inflammation such as psoriasis and seborrhea There is also scientific evidence for its laxative properties but there are questions about its safety I have not been able to locate any good scientific evidence that it is useful for acid reflux Here is more information about heartburn and its treatments I hope you get relief with what has been prescribed Be sure to let your doctor know if you are not getting better And always talk to your doctor before taking any supplements I definitely would not stop taking the Fosamax without first talking to your doctor You dont want to risk having more problems with kidney stones The side effects you list are not commonly associated with Fosamax Of course everyone is different and its possible that theyre associated with the medicine but it could also be something else There are also other medications similiar to Fosamax that the doctor may want to try if it seems like the side effects are due to the medicine Hope this helps httpwwwwebmdcomatozguidesbrokennose Quit agitating itIt came from some type of medication with sodiumReduce your sodium intake gradually Hi The only thing you can do like me

Do hope this helps you Good Luck Hi Just give it time and it should slowly go not much more you can do for a bruise Good Luck Hi Its an interesting question just why do we blush but as you will read its all very simple core of how stuff works Blushing from embarrassment is governed by the same system that activates your fightorflight response  the sympathetic nervous system This system is involuntary meaning you dont actually have to think to carry out the processes In contrast moving your arm is a voluntary action You have to think about it no matter how fleeting the thought is This is good because if moving your arm was involuntary people would end up buying a lot of stuff they dont want at auctions When youre embarrassed your body releases adrenaline This hormone acts as a natural stimulant and has an array of effects on your body that are all part of the fightorflight response Adrenaline speeds up your breathing and heart rate to prepare you to run from danger It causes your pupils to grow bigger to allow you to take in as much visual information as possible It slows down your digestive process so that the energy can be redirected to your muscles All of these effects account for the jolt you feel when you find yourself embarrassed Adrenaline also causes your blood vessels to dilate called vasodilation  in order to improve blood flow and oxygen delivery This is the case with blushing The veins in your face respond to a signal from the chemical transmitter adenylyl cyclase  which tells the veins to allow the adrenaline to do its magic As a result the veins in your face dilate allowing more blood to flow through them than usual creating the reddened appearance that tells others youre embarrassed In other words adrenaline causes more local blood flow in your cheeks See all very simple Good Luck Hi I found this piece of info if this is you During a TIA one of the small blood vessels that supply your brain with oxygenrich blood becomes blocked Atherosclerosis is a common cause of narrowed arteries It occurs when fatty deposits known as plaques develop on the inner lining of your blood vessels This can cause your blood vessels to become thickened hard and less elastic making it more difficult for blood to flow through them Ok if this is you then simple cayenne pepper may help clear this plaque away for you there are many ways to take cayenne you can try capsules the ok but when the capsule opens inside you it can give you the cramps or like me you can mix cayenne with tomato paste and thin with olive oil to start with to a heat that suits you next time you mix you can add a bit more and so on take 3 small spoonfuls each morning wash each down with water now if you want because it very good for your blood do a jar of very fine chopped garlic and keep this in olive oil just add a spoonful on top of the cayenne before you take it All very good for you and give it a couple of weeks to start working at full strength Good

the dry skin off Also try to drink more water Let me know how you make out Good luck It could just be a nervous disorder I have seen this in kids and adults but you could check with your family doc to make sure Is this Possible Been where you are did that too Talk with your family doctor about a chronic viral bronchitis He or she may prescribe a course of antibiotics possibly followed by a short course of Predizone to reduce the background of upper respiratory irritation and inflammation which has built up Note though technically trained and a patient advocate for people with chronic face pain I am not a physician Red Lawhern PhD Either mild heart attack or stroke can produce the symptoms you name I would advise that you be seen promptly for postevent evaluation by a medical professional Regards Red Lawhern PhD The watery nose and eyes can be improved with an antihistamine either Benadryl or Childrens Claritin or Zyrtec The slight headache can be improved by ibuprofen or acetaminophen Impetigo is not due to a virus It is due to a bacteria either Strep Staph or both This is why it is treated with antibiotics either topical creams or ointments or orally like penicillin tablets Impetigo is contagious by both direct and indirect contact surfaces contaminated with the bacteria to a person who is susceptible Unlike highly contagious diseases like chicken pox varicella impetigo does not spread through the air or through sneezing An exposed person will not necessary catch it but they can especially if you have an open area of your skin use the same towel etc Your roommate has a responsibility to you and others to keep the impetigo covered and use at least a topical antibiotic ointment or cream until it is healed For you keep your hands clean and avoid touching your own mouth or nose  two favorite places that it likes to live However impetigo  those honeycrusted oozing sores  can occur anywhere on your skin surface Younger children bleed very easilythe smallest cut can bleed like a major laceration Since the nose is highly vascular it takes very little for it to bleeda probing finger even if you have not seen it dry environment allergies colds etc Once the nose bleeds a scab forms but because the lining of the nose is a mucous membrane the scab tends to fall offresulting in another bleed often from the same exact spot Recurrent nose bleeds may require a simple chemical cautery that can be done in the office Momentarily unpleasant this often solves the problem You can also coat the inside of the nose with saline GEL or Vaseline to keep things moist Discourage any nosepickingyour child may be different but the preschooler in my practice make nosepicking into a fine art form You can read more about nosebleeds by putting EPISTAXIS into you WebMD search engine If the bleeding was from the same side of the nose you may be experiening ONE nose bleed that has recurred three times This happens when the scab that forms either fails to adhere to the slippery mucous lining and bleeds again or a probing finger dislodges it As long as your child is not bruised in other areas or anemic nose bleeds are often more annoying than serious You do need to know the proper way of controlling the bleeding so check on the WebMD site for nosebleeds and you will find some helpful information With that said I am a bit concerned about the head injury Since I have no way to take a more thorough medical history or examine him this should be address with his medical provider I have no way of blindly diagnosing the cause of your sore throat over the Internetthis is going to take a handson examination and perhaps a Strep test Because you are pregnant you MUST be carefully examined and treated with medications that are safe for you and your baby This may be just a bad cold but you will need to see your medical provider to make sure you do not have something more serious going on That would not be likely Yeast likes warm dark moist places like the vagina or inside a diaper The eyes and nose really doesnt have a welcoming environment that would be favorable to yeast You are safe ANY powder can cause respiratory difficulties in children This is why many pediatricians no longer recommend them The recommended diaper treatments are ointments and lotionsnot powders If you do use it be VERY CAREFUL not to cause a cloud of powder that you or your baby will inhale Permanent relief That may require a surgical reduction of those TURBINATES by an ENT specialist One method that is used to control them nonsurgically would be nasal corticosteroid sprays This requires a prescription by your medical provider Stop freaking out The chance of you getting an amoebic infection from shower water in your nose would be highly highly unlikelyunless you are showering with contaminated untreated water Remember this is the same water you drink and use to brush your teeth I have no way of blindly diagnosing you over the Internet but I can tell you two things about mono First the screen test mono spot is not very accurate if taken too early in the course of the disease and second a better test would be an EBV panel There are many illnesses that can give you monolike symptoms so you should have your blood test repeated in a week with the more accurate panel and of course see your medical provider again if your symptoms continue Yes It is safe It may be time to see an ENT  Ear Nose and Throat  specialist someone who has the skill and equipment to peer up that clogged nostril of yours to see if you have a physical obstruction like a deviated septum or polyp If not a trial of nasal corticosteroid sprays by prescription only may be something for your doctor to try Not all sinus infections as a matter of fact very few are due to bacterial infections so this could be another reason why the two course of antibiotics didnt seem to help The ENT can also check your sinuses Cold sores herpes simplex is caused by the herpes virus not the various viruses that cause colds A cold sore can occur while you have a cold but this is just a reactivation of the herpes virus that you already have You may have sustained a small corneal abrasion from this incident Corneal abrasions heal quickly but are at risk for a secondary infectionand chickens are not known for their high levels of personal hygiene You can see your optometrist and urgent care facility or your primary care provider Most will have the ability to fluoresceinstain your eye check it for an abrasion but always ask first when you make your appointment This visit should be as soon as possible Decongestants can be used with antihistamines or separatelyas long as the dosgages are appropriate Newer recommendations do not support the use of these types of drugs for children under the age of six unless specifically prescribed and approved by the childs medical provider Decongestants have not proven to be very effective in the management of colds and do not help children with allergies Antihistamines can be helpful for allergies however but again it is best to get the okay from your childs pediatrician because of the age You may have created a worse problem because of your overuse of a nasal decongestant that is only recommended to be use for a few daysnot a year Habitual use of nasal decongestants cause a rebound effectthe more you use them the lesseffective they become so you use them more often that recommended Eventually you are addicted to those sprays and will need expert medical help to get off of them My suggestion for you is to see an ENT for a highlevel examination If you have a bleeding site in the nose the ENT can chemically cauterize it The ENT can also help you get off of those nasal decongestants by putting you on a special steroid nasal spray andor other oral medications that will be much more effective in controlling your constant nasal symptoms In the meantime learn the CORRECT way to stop a nosebleed WebMD has a site on nosebleeding that is easy to find use a moisturizer for you nose saline GEL or even a light coating of Vaseline and drink lots of water Keep you fingers out of your nose too Paying cash for an ENT consultation could be expensive but perhaps manageable but if you need imaging studies like a CT scan or MRI or even surgery the costs are astronomical if you do not have insurance I do not know the details of your case or if you can wait until you have insurance but if you can it would be financially better It would not be possible for me to guess since I dont know the insurance you are intending to get or even the state were you live to know if this ENT visit will be covered let alone know if any tests or surgeries would be paid under those benefits No your brain and nose are safe from mushroom or fungus growth I do not believe there are any nonsurgical methods to straighten out a crooked nose so save your money for the friendly neighborhood plastic surgeon for a rhinoplasty nose job I cant blindly tell you what it is over the Internet I would need to examine you and perhaps send a specimen off to pathology Clearly the dermatologist is your SKIN specialist so if you lesion is bigger I would suggest that you go back Forego the steroid injection until you consult the dermatotogist again or see a different dermatologist for a second opinion It would not be wise to selfdiagnose yourself as having a secondary bacterial infection from your recent viral illness and selfprescribed ampicillin It would be advisable for you to be properly examined and diagnosed first by a medical professional Ampicillin is not used very much any more so it is unlikely that even if you did have a bacterial infection this would not be the antibiotic of choice Signs of secondary bacterial infection such as pneumonia as a result of a respiratory virus would be a high fever a worsening cough with expectoration of dark phlegm chest discomfort rapid respiration and lethargy A mild sore throat or runny nose does not necessarily indicate a need for ampicillin Nosebleeds epistaxis can be a sign of many different medical conditions but what you have described in your brief postings  those specks of blood  does not sound very serious Please keep in mind that I do not know anything about you your medical history or have any way of delving into your specific case The nasopharynx is very rich in blood supply so it does not take much for it to bleed In the vast majority of cases this is not an ominous sign Seeing your doctor in a few weeks is fine In an adult it is not necessary to mount a fever response to Strep Some people do most people do not So you can still have Strepyou were certainly exposed assuming your son was correctly diagnosed Any chance you can get a Strep test Some clinicians will just treat symptomatic parental contacts but that would be totally up to the discretion of the clinician It is not the strongest antibiotic for kids but it is effective for bacterial sinusitis Bacterial sinusitis is uncommon in two year olds since most of their sinuses are immature and undeveloped at this age Statistically most of these toddler sinus infections are VIRAL and viruses as you probably know will not respond to ANY antibiotic no matter how strong Bacterial sinusitis assuming this is what your two year old actually has can be tricky to treat often requiring longer antibiotic courses or a different type of antibiotic Failure to respond in seven days may necessitate a reevaluation of this treatment regime Just because he still has thick or colored mucous does not mean that a the antibiotic is not helping or b the cause is bacterial and not viral Viral infections can cause stagnation of mucous and that alone can result in thick greenyellow mucous You cant really use snot color as a diagnostic clue no matter what your mother told you No the color of mucous does not automatically assume that something is viral bacterial or allergicit is just a clue In most cases green mucous is more likely to indicate stagnation especially if the green is primarily in the mornings Just a like a pond that turns green when water is not flowing in and out the mucous can be green when you are chronically congested You will need to be medically evaluated in order to determine if the green really has a bacterial association or is just plain ol stagnation We all have nasal bones but it is not where you think It is a very tiny thin bone just between the eyes Most of the nose is just cartilege Colds are caused by viruses The only biological explanation in your case would be that your allergies are overwhelming your immune system making you more vulnerable to getting a viral infection Allergies cause congestion and inflammation and respiratory viruses tend to be opportunisitichitting you when you are down so to speak There are no direct relationship between colds and allergies otherwise but a person can certainly have both at the same time The most common reason for this is a foreign body  usually food Your threeyear old for some reason decided it was a good idea to put a green bean pea or  in the nose If there is a bad smell and a nasty drainage from just oneside this is the most likely reason Nasal foreign bodies can be challenging to remove so it may be a good idea to allow the medical provider to do it for you See a medical provider so that you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated You may not know the reasons you are crying and not feeling well but a medical provider would likely have more insight This complicated matter cannot be solved blindly over the Internet so please do the right thing and see a medical professional Always consider environmental allergies as a possible cause but six year olds are very prone to backtoback viral infections from school andor daycare I dont know since I cannot SEE this rash Sorry You would need to take this child to see a medical provider so he can be properly examined diagnosed and treated if necessary Kindergarten is the cause of your daughters frequent colds coupled by her questionable personal hygiene and social commitments to her many friends The average child gets 69 viral infections mostly colds per year and most are in the winter months When children are plunged into a new environment with new kids they get new germs There are over 200 different viruses that cause the common cold so until she pays her duesand gets enough colds to build her immunity she will be be catching her share and bringing them home to her family In most cases your daughter doesnt have a mysterious weak immune system All she has is overexposure to children her same age all with the same questionable hygiene The play togethertouch each other and everything else and they are taught to share Germs are freely shared She will improve over time but you are going to see un upswing of illnesses after the holidays because her colleagues are traveling to different locations where they will pick up even newer and morealien bugs and bring them back to kindergarten to shareagain Hang in there Medical providers can do little to prevent cold and nothing to cure them All we can do is treat symptoms watch for complications and wait them out Lay off for a few days and I am sure your volume will return Most ejaculate is semen not sperm created in the prostate gland Twice a day can be a bit much for this overworked gland to recover If you are still having burning you will need to see your medical provider but as a man it is not very likely that you have a UTIbut you could have prostatitis This is just a guess however since making that call requires an examination Your cold has nothing to do with this issue Do I have the ability to diagnose you over the Internet No I do not I do not have any way of determining the cause or the significance of your symptoms based solely on your brief posting I do not know your medical history nor do I have the ability to reach out and examine you  all essential components to getting an accurate diagnosis While I am very sympathetic to your financial situation and lack of insurance there is very little that can be achieved without a handon medical examination Look for free clinics student health centers or urgent care facilities Give you body and your health the same consideration as you would if your car suddenly broke down and needed a costly repair There is a reason or reasons but the cause may not be apparent If you are having a nose bleed from the same side then it may be the same bleeding site that is reoccurring A tiny scab will form on this area but because of the slippery mucous membrane the scab tends to fall off with the least provocation and start to bleed again This bleeding site can be chemically cauterized by your medical provider if it is identified during an exam Dry air allergies colds blowing the nose picking etc all can be playing a roll Your son is certainly taking enough medications to help a runny nose but you may need to give it more time to work A fouryear old child can certainly have allergies but he can also get frequent colds if he is in preschool where he is constantly exposed If the drainage is coming from BOTH nostrils it is most likely allergy andor colds If the drainage is coming from just ONE nostril he will need to have his nose carefully examined for a foreign body yes four year olds do this He is on an antihistamine Claritin and Singulair that will help dry up his drip The nasal steroid Nasonex will help with inflammation The next step may be to have him allergy tested Although Vicks has been used for decades to help colds it will not do much for allergies and may even cause increased irritation You may want to consider not using it The humidifier is fineit will thin the mucous that he is making so it can be swallowed more easily but sometimes the constant use of humidifiers can be counterproductive if he has a mold allergy perhaps unknown at this time Give these medications a good month to do their job If he is still not improved talk to his pediatrician about a referral to an allergist Your first and most important step it to determine the extent of your nose injury This may take imaging studies so I would suggest that you see a medical professional like an ENT specialist so you can be properly examined and diagnosed first No the pinkish color in your mucous is most likely just blood The nasal area is rich in blood supply so the irritation associated with a cold or allergy can cause some of these tiny blood vessels to briefly bleed This is quite common and no cause for concern Epistaxis nose bleeds can have mulitple causes from irritation of your nasal membranes from allergies or colds to just dry air Lesscommon people who tend to bruise or bleed easily are likely to have more nosebleeds Taking a daily aspirin or any medicine that is known to interfere with blood clotting can cause them Your first step is to read about nosebleeds WebMD has some great information Next you need to know how to appropriately STOP a nosebleed many people think they do but are doing it wrong Nosebleeds that are frequent and from the same side of the nose can be chemicallycauterized by your medical provider In most cases this will fix the problem You are likely bleeding and rebleeding from the same nasal site This may need a quick and easy chemical cauterization of the bleeding site if your doctor can find it Most of the time this will be quite evident Yes it is appropriate for you to see your doctor Do some Internet research on the proper way to control a nosebleed many people do it incorrectly Are you taking aspirin or any other bloodthinning medications Are you bruising or bleeding in other areas If so your doctor can order a few lab tests to make sure everything is fine That would be a difficult question to answer without the ability to examine you Cold and influenza are viruses and tend to cause similar symptoms Influenza tends to be worse usually with a fever response not just hot or cold flashes Influenza is a respiratory viruses some abdominal symptoms are not typical in adults kids with flu can get them though If I had to take a guess I would say that you most likely have a nasty viral infection but not necessarily influenza The only way to be sure is to have a rapid flu test If you have been ill for less than two days antiviral medications like Tamiflu can be used There is really nothing that can be done for a cold other than symptom control Treating the SYMPTOMS of colds and flu is often the only thing that can be done trying to feel better while Nature orchestrates the cure Both colds and flu last about a week with the first 34 days being the worst It would be vitally important for you to see a medical professional so that you can have a proper examination and diagnostic workup You are tired for a reason but at this point you do not know that reason or reasons This is a complicated array of symptoms and cause cannot be determined blindly over the Internet Ask you OB about Mucinex since there are many types and combinations Diphenhydramine IS the generic name for Benadryl Your OB can provide you will a list of safe medications you can take during your pregnancy Antihistamines like diphenhydramineBenadryl will NOT open up a stuffy nose They are used to DRY a drippy nose Try nasal saline sprays and a humidifier Colds are not the only thing that can cause a stuffy nose when you are pregnantthose raging hormones can also cause coldlike stuffiness You can see them but unfortunately I cannot Dermatological problems require a handson examination either your primary care provider or a dermatologist An accurate diagnosis  not something that I could blindly give you based solely on your very brief vague description  is the most important step in determining the proper treatment No it will not work or help the cold symptoms It will just make his feet smell like Vicks Dont tell your mother or grandmother that I told you this but Vicks on the feet is absolutely worthless No pinworms are intestinal parasites They only live in your rectum and anal area If you have them see your medical provider for an effective prescription treatment like Vermox I think thye are perfectly safe I cant imagine a situation where these strips would be hazardous or cause tissue damage I cant see the size or location of the basal cell but dermatologists using MOHS surgery can remove this skin cancer relatively easy with a minimum or scarring pain or complications You are only 87 Dont start packing you bags just yet Taking it off now may be preferable to dealing with a bigger one in the future You want to look good when Willard Scott puts your picture on television when you turn 100 A bright yellow nasal discharge does not automatically mean sinusitis or even indicate a bacterial infection Mucous can become yellow for a variety of reasons including simple stagnation Most sinus infections like colds are viral and do not require antibiotics The fact that you do not have a fever or other sinus related symptoms would seem to indicate that you may not have a sinusitis You can definitely wait it out a bit longer Viral infections tend to last about a week worse in the first 34 days Do all of the supportive measures drink plenty of water humidify your environment use saline nasal spray as well as the Pantanse and keep that stuffy nose following Should your symptoms persist or worsen it would be wise to seek medical care so that you can be properly examined and treated Yesit is safe The flu vaccine can be given if you have a cold Impetigo can form on your lips however since I have no way of examining you over the Internet I have no way of knowing if your blister is impetigo or not If your nose is extremely sore this is not normalnor is it necessarily a sign of a sinus infection I would suggest that you see a medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated You are most likely having ETD Eustachian Tube Dysfunction The etubes are tiny ventilation and drainage tubes that run from your middle ear to the back of your throat When you have a viral respiratory infection colds flu these tubes can become clogged or swollen resulting in some ear fullnessdiscomfort When you blow your nose you are forcing some air up these tubes causing your ear to pop In most cases this will resolve spontaneously in few days or a few weeks depending on the severity There is really no average time Most people with sinusitis do not have any loss of taste or smell but for those that do it can take several daysto several weeksor even longer for those senses to return As much as we would like to predict outcome healing time is so variable in humans that it would be impossible ClaritinZyrtecand Allegra are longacting nonsedating antihistamines They are all compatible with Singulair No I am very sorry but WebMD Health Experts cannot provide that professional service for you You would need to physically see another ENT specialist  someone that can correlate your physical

just like you would use in your armpits Controlled perspiration would go a long way in controlled a disagreeable odor If you are female malodors can originate from the vagina If you are male the area

skin Staph or skin Strep He does not neeed to get it from anyone since these bugs are normal flora on just about every human on this planet An irritationa scratcha biteis all that it takes to break the protective integrity of the skin and allow this bacteria to go inward and develop impetigo This can take as little as a day or so If the impetigo can be covered he is less likely to pose a risk to the other kids It should be under treatment either with a topical or oral antibiotic regime The two medications are compatible but many clinicians do not use antihistamines in children who have ear infections since this can thicken the middle ear fluid and make it more difficult to clear in some not all children I cant tell you what you have not enough information and no ability to examine you but I can tell you that shingles does not occur on BOTH sides of the face Shingles closely follows a nerve pathway and those pathways never cross the midline of the facethey stay on just one side If your primary care medical provider has not been able to properly diagnose you then you may need to see a dermatologist Your acne may need treated either by your primary care medical provider or a good dermatologist Treatment will vary based on the severity and type of acne lesions that you have Your horizontal lines are probably striae  and yes they are considered stretch marks even if you are not getting taller or stretching in that direction This is a guess however since I cant see them There are other reasons that can cause striae but I do not know your medical history You can read about striae on the Internet Striae and acne are not associated Unless you have a skin infection that is consistent with MRSA there is really nothing to test While this may be frightening and unexpected a random nosebleed is really nothing to worry about During sex the blood pressure tends to rise which can be a factor Low room humidity a cold or allergy taking a daily aspirin or minor nasal mucosa trauma can also be factors If you are having an signs of bruising on your body for no particular reason one might consider a blood clotting issue that will require your doctor to examine you If you nose is fine and you are not having any subsequent issues then I would not be too alarmed It would be concerning if a cause is not apparent Dry air colds sinus infection nosepicking trauma all can cause nose bleeding It would be concerning if this happens frequently or if he is having bruising in other parts of his body without apparent trauma Nose bleeds need to be stopped PROPERLY and many people do not do it correctly Use your search engine for nosebleed or epistaxis management on WebMD and you will find the right way Benadryl diphenhydramine does not cause a fever nor is fever an adverse reaction to this antihistamine Allergies do not cause fever so any elevation in temperature that may have experienced is most likely do to your cold assuming you have correctly diagnosed yourself Fever is the bodys natural response to fighting off an infection Colds can set the stage for secondary bacterial infections so yesit would be wise to see your medical provider to be examined diagnosed and treated Colds last a week so when someone tells me that they are a getting worse after a week and b coughing blood there is a clear indication to seek some handson medical care Not an expert here but Im going to say no because it just means he probably swallowed some of the blood from his nosebleed and depending how much blood he swallowed it may have made him nauseated Can she take a decongestant such as Sudefed or Sudefed PE That would help with the congestion greatly I am also a type 2 diabetic on Coumadin and take Sudefed daily Also if the nosebleeds are an issue you may want to try some Aquaphor on a qtip swabbing the inside of her nostrils with it Hope this helps Ive read it does as does dry air or nose veins that are very close to the surface I would get the physical side checked out first by a dr Apparently Dr Oz just did a piece about The Triangle of Deaththat area from between your eyes to just below the corners of your mouth Most people will have their hands in and around there doing something either consciously or subconsciously at least once a day Pulling nose hair and popping zits on the nose and near the lips can easily lead to infection including infections that can spread to the brain Im not suggesting you did any of those things but swelling is a common sign of infection Tooth pain can come from a sinus infection and a piece of an extracted tooth can enter the sinus and cause an infection But for a specific problem with polyps I would see an ENT an ear nose and throat specialist You may be suffering from a combination of acne and seborrheic dermatitis SD Typically SD sufferers will have flaky skin around the nose and hairline in combination with dry patches There is usually an underlying fungal component with SD that can be treated with an antifungal cream andor shampoo Flareups can be controlled with overthecounter corticosteroids Once this component is under control your acne will be easier to treat Your acne prevention regimen should include an antimicrobial facial wash that contains benzoyl peroxide acid or alphahydroxy acid a mild exfoliating agent and salicylic acid to help clear your clogged pores Several major skincare companies manufacture a blackhead extractor Blackhead extractors are small stainless steel devices that are specifically designed to gently remove unwanted comedones blackheads They are readily available for under 10 Along with removing your blackheads adopt a skincare regimen that will exfoliate your skin Exfoliation will help minimize the recurrence of blackheads You may consider using zinc oxide on your nose to prevent any further damage to the skin of that area Many beach lifeguards have to resort to using this white barrier because they have not found any other way to protect their nose especially from the damaging rays of the sun Youre very astute to recognize that it is dangerous to continue to expose your already red nose to further UV radiation He doesnt have a head injury it was more for a bump than a hit sounds like a typical cold or cough take zinc to knock out the little bugs that make ya feel icky Hi sorry to hear about your pain For longterm aid you could try decreasing your meal sizes as the day progresses especially at dinner You could also try eating 34 hours before going to bed to allow your food to digest better chewing your food properly to aid with digestion and eating less processed foods For temporary relief you could try taking over the counter medicines like Gaviscon or Dica or antacids or chewing gum Hope this helps To

her within minutes of each other but she kept a nose bleed and busted eye vessals constatly they told her at the hospital that that should have been her red flag every time that happened it made more clot build up in her brain steam which was what eventually lead up to her stroke im not saying that is the case here but it is a possibility I too get Impetigo yearly The specific strain that I get is unique to my body and is not contagious to anyone else I have had it since I was an infant For years the doctors could not figure out what it was because if it wasnt highly contagious it could not have been Impetigo or so they thought Your friend has the same situation as me It is very rare to have a strain of Impetigo that is not contagious but that doesnt mean it doesnt exist If you are still unsure wash your hands regularly and disinfect surfaces and commonly touched items I have never spread my Impetigo to another person when I was younger my siblings would tease me about my Impetigo and

her back to her allergist as soon as you can I dont know if her Dr prescribed the Zyrtec but there are other medicines that can control the other symptoms  And be sure to be following the advice of the allergist It may be something else triggering her allergies or asthma My daughter takes Nasonex along with Oceans nasal spray and Asmenex Twist Inhaler for breathing then also Loratidineand those
