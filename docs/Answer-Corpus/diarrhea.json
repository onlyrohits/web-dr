{"text": "Yes Any dark leafy green vegetable can cause loose stools especially in large quantities Be carefull to wash your greens by swishing them in mildly soapy water or vege wash then rinse as chemicals sprayed on these crops can cause the same problem get checked out after i had my gallbladder surgery i went through the same thing let me ask you this are you eating anything spicy or drinking thinks with a lot of caffeine or carbonation i was and that was my problem i still have GERD i have to take medication and i can not eat anything spicy anymore hope this helps you Just a thought Probably have no energy because you are dehydrated from the increased loss of fluid even tho you are drinking it may very well not be enough The blood may be caused from the increased amount of defecation causing irritation in the bowel The first thing that comes to my mind is Cholecystitis gallbladder inflammation andor stones I have been an RN for over 20 years and have had this condition myself and it was necessary to have my gall bladder removed The symptoms that you describe is exactly what I experienced to a T A total gall bladder work up was suggested on my behalf and surgery was required A visit to your physician is must assuredly suggested and questions related to the gall bladder and even the pancreas should be explored Yes foods that we eat can cause black tarry stools But chocolate donuts cookies dont sound like the cause Thinks like black licorice pepto bismuth blueberries and iron supplements are more likely suspects for sources of ingested products causing the blacktarry colorThe diarrhea and feeling light headed can go along with the stomach bug Ibuprofen can be harsh to the digestive tract and might cause some internal bleeding But the shortness of breath is a disturbing symptom when combined with feeling lightheaded and having blacktarry diarrhea This could be a sign of a more significant medical problem and even a medical emergency Conditions such as ulcers gastritis hemorrhoids a stomach tear called MalloryWeiss usually caused by violent coughing and some types of cancer are legitimate medical concerns I recommend that you go to the emergency room of a nearby hospital to ruleout any type of internal bleeding that could change from minimal to massive quickly Be prepared for possible testing including barium studies xrays rectal exam stool specimen culture and a colonoscopy As you can see by this answer many possible causes may be the reason for your present medical condition It is virtually impossible to diagnosis the exact cause of your problem through only your question on this web site Since the possibility does exist no matter how remote that you may be in a serious medical crisis please go the hospital dont hesitate to call 911 where trained medical personnel and testing equipment are available  It is the antibiotic and usually not yogurt that causes those GI disturbances Some yogurts contain beneficial bacteria Beneficial bacteria in yogurt may be listed on the package with such names as Acidophilus Thermophilus  Streptococcus Bifidus Bulgaricus or Lactobacillus  These bacteria may actually help to reduce the negative GI symptoms from the antibiotic Look for those ingredients on your yogurt container even when not taking an antibiotic to ensure that you receive positive probiotic bacteria Many of the leading brands of yogurts contain these beneficial bacteria If necessary ask your grocery store dairy manager or the pharmacist for assistance in selecting a yogurt with positive bacteria  At 16 years of age or at any age waiting for a diagnosis related to liver symptoms is upsetting and scary Liver disorders can strike at any age and even in people who live a clean and healthy life Your doctor should have explained the possible causes of your symptoms as they relate to the black spots It is not possible to determine the causes of your liver spots until further testing is completed but the possible significance of the spots could have been discussed With that said please do not listen to wellmeaning individuals suggesting a fatty liver as your problem For the record most people have some degree of fatty liver Here are my two suspicions regarding your case I recommend that you receive more information from your doctor surround yourself with the best and most open medical professionals have as many radiologic tests done as possible help to keep the diagnostic testing moving as swiftly as possible to reduce large gaps of time when you are just waiting and thinking talk about your feelings to family and friends and maintain a positive spirit I wish you well during this period of medical uncertainty  Stools that are gray colored may indicate problems with the drainage system involving interactions occurring between the pancreas gallbladder and liver Bile salts are normally released by the liver If there is a liver disturbance bile production may be reduced or the release of bile can be blocked The bile chemicals may buildup in the body and result in gray colored stools Sometimes a yellowing of the skin is also a symptom observed in conjunction with clay colored stools Digestion of the peanut butter may or may not hold any significance in the development of your change in stool color I would recommend not waiting any longer for resolution Stools that are gray colored along with abdominal pain may be indicative of a liver infection or liver disease Anytime that stools are not brown in color is the right time to contact your doctor to have the situation correctly assessed It could be something else you need to go to doctor and see why are you having all these problem maybe your ovarian cysts came back I cant really say I just advise you to see your doctor I hope this help you Good Luck Luv You got a serious problem you need to go see your doctor Next time you might dont be so luck Go see a doctor you need help I would take the baby in black could mean problem but the dirrhea lasting that long could be causing dehydration and that could lead to other problems The doctor can check the stool and take action if dehydration is really involved You have a fast metabolism like me I dont think theres nothing wrong with it with the exception that when we go out to a restaurant for dinner is like Ahhh I will be back and you come back half an hour later like are you ok where did you go so it can be sometimes a little bit embarrassing Overall I think there is nothing wrong with that See a gyn for check up and follow up Could be a urinary tract infection UTI Go see your doctor for a urinalysis or urine culture With the gall bladder its eating that the problem I would get him checked for stomach and intestinal virusesinfection Just me though better safe than sorry I would strongly suggest your fiance to go see his doctor immediately Especially if he still has his gallbladder as an intolerance to greasy foods is a good indicator of gallbladder problems It could also be a problem with the way his body is absorbing food However if he no longer has his gallbladder and this is the only symptom he is showing he could always try eating more fiber as well as taking peptobismol before the meal That would help but I would advise he consult his doctor as this could be a sign of a bigger problem I would also like to indicate that I only started havin these symptoms after I looked them and started worrying about Also just talked to the girl she said she was clean Good question People routinely use the word diarrhea to refer to any type of loose bowel movement and thats not exactly accurate Diarrhea refers to a bowel movement that is almost purely liquid It contains some small pieces of stool but its mostly water fluid to be precise Loose stool is a soft bowel movement that ranges in consistency from somewhat formed to very runny Whereas the particles of stool material in diarrhea are small and few in a loose stool the particles of stool material may be goodsized In a sample of diarrhea the main component is very waterlike in a sample of loose stool no matter how runny the main component is stool material I hope that clears things up Wishing you well Diarrhea while common is not considered normal In children diarrhea can lead rapidly to dehydration Please check out this WebMD fact sheet on  And then use this to see if you need to take your son to a doctor Meanwhile make sure your son is drinking plenty of fluids You may give him plain water or a preparation such as Pedialyte You also can give him a product like Gatorade that has been diluted Use about 1 part Gatorade to 3 parts water This will help him stay hydrated I hope your son gets better soon Im sorry your husband is going through this and its good of you to help him with it Several conditions can cause the symptoms you describe so it wouldnt hurt to see a medical professional for an opinion Assuming the cause is benign that is not lifethreatening however your husband or you might consider keeping a diary of what he eats every day and how it affects his stomach issues If this is a  it might come to light through a diary Your husband also could try going on a bland diet to see if that helps his problem In a bland diet foods generally are cooked free of fiber and excessive fat and not spicy Examples are white rice chicken and broth If you begin with this type of diet you can then add foods one at a time to see if any one of them triggers an adverse reaction in your husband I hope this helps  specifically is known to turn the tongue andor stool black temporarily This condition can persist for a few days after you take the product The effect depends on how much Pepto you took too If the black stool goes away after a few days you probably have nothing to worry about If it persists for more than a week you probably should see a health care provider Bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract everything from your stomach to your rectum can cause the stool to turn black Im going to assume however that the situation is temporary due to the use of pink bismuth Wishing you all the best for a speedy recovery This is an interesting question and Im glad you asked it In order to develop an allergy to a substance you have to be exposed to it In other words its extremely rare to experience an allergic reaction to something on first exposure Its not impossible but its fairly rare One good example is penicillin Millions of people took penicillin as children and suffered no ill effects Many of those people today have penicillin allergies That early exposure caused their bodies to mount an extreme immune reaction to penicillin later on That could be what happened to you too If a physician confirmed your allergy you need to take it to heart Allergies not only can come on later in life they can get worse over time So that diarrhea from eating eggs today could turn into anaphylaxis eventually You also should be aware that people with a documented egg allergy may be discouraged from getting flu shots Id suggest you talk with your health care provider to see if this restriction applies to you Sorry youre going through this Its difficult to give up a wellloved food Im sorry to hear youre going through this It sounds very unpleasant and I applaud you for having what could be an embarrassing situation checked out by a medical professional I guess Im going to assume youve been tested for sexually transmitted diseases STDs Several STDs can cause these types of symptoms I urge you to continue seeking medical attention until you get a good diagnosis and treatment plan Theres obviously something wrong and it may take real persistence on your part to keep your providers moving forward in trying to diagnose this If necessary get a referral to a urologist even though the symptoms seem to be external Wishing you well I strongly suggest you return to your health care provider to make sure you have not developed a infection as a result of your antibiotic therapy Watery diarrhea that lingers for a month after taking antibiotics can be a sign of this infection which is highly contagious Meanwhile be sure to maintain vigilance with handwashing Antiseptic hand rubs are not effective the infection You need to wash your hands frequently with plain soap and water then dry thoroughly This will help you avoid passing the infection to someone else if in fact you have it You also need to maintain your hydration Be sure to drink plenty of plain water and have a sports drink when the diarrhea is particularly bad If you do have  your doctor can treat it with a different antibiotic I wish you all the best with this Sorry to hear you went through that It sounds awful This definitely could have been a case of food poisoning Many packaged meats including those from a deli contain quite a few preservatives but the meat still could have gone bad after nine days Abdominal cramps diarrhea nausea chills fever headache and weakness all can be signs of food poisoning The exact symptoms relate to the type of germ causing the food poisoning Also symptoms from the most common types of food poisoning usually start within 2 to 6 hours of consuming the contaminated food so your symtpoms match up with that timeframe Except for infantschildren the elderly pregnant women or those with compromised immune systems most people dont require treatment for food poisoning It should go away on its own within a couple of days The best thing to do is drink plenty of water and allow the diarrhea to flow You want to let those bad germs get out of your body If the diarrhea continues for more than three days it may be time to try an overthecounter antidiarrhea medication or consult a health care provider I hope youre feeling better by now You probably wont want any corned beef for awhile You should call your pediatrician immediately Severe diarrhea in an infant can become lifethreatening because it can cause serious dehydration Meanwhile be sure youre providing plenty of fluids to your baby including an electrolyte drink such as Pedialyte This may help her avoid severe dehydration and can help keep her electrolytes in balance If your baby is running a fever along with the diarrhea you should take her to the emergency room These symptoms in a 17monthold should not be taken lightly I wish you and your baby all the best This certainly merits a call to the pediatrician He or she may want to examine your son to discover whats going on here Diarrhea shouldnt cause the scrotum to swell This symptom may be completely unrelated to the diarrhea or there could be some sort of injury to the childs testes that is causing the diarrhea Either way you want to get this assessed Id suggest you call your pediatrician as soon as possible Meanwhile keep your son hydrated by providing plenty of fluids Wishing you all the best Let me start by saying that is no less dangerous in terms of causing cancer than cigarettes I hope your husband realizes this Even if the stomach problems and diarrhea are new symptoms they could indeed be caused by smokeless tobacco usage People who use smokeless tobacco and spit still swallow some of the saliva that contains harmful substances Thats why some of the use can include cancers of the stomach pancreas and colon Of course smokeless tobacco use also can cause many types of oral cancers If your husbands symptoms dont clear up on their own or if theyre accompanied by fever pain or shortness of breath then he definitely should have them checked out by a medical professional You can start with your primary health care provider Best wishes to you and your husband Im sorry youre going through this It sounds miserable My initial reaction is that you should make an appointment to see a medical professional Diarrhea by which I mean mostly watery stool with little to no solid waste in it lasting longer than a week is not normal for an adult Usually if diarrhea is caused by food poisoning it resolves within a few days The pain you describe in conjunction with the diarrhea also is concerning While Im not suggesting you have any type of lifethreatening condition I would suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider as soon as possible Meanwhile its crucial for you to drink plenty of fluids Because your diarrhea has been going on for so long you might also want to sip a sports drink like Gatorade Dehydration might explain why you feel so weak I wish you all the best in finding out whats causing this problem The good news is that bright red blood on the surface of your stool or in the toilet water or on the toilet paper usually isnt the type of blood associated with a cancer of the digestive tract Usually bright red blood like that is more associated with or a minor rectal bleed due to passing hard stool or straining hard during a bowel movement When we talk about blood in the stool related to a cancer this blood usually isnt recognizable as blood It usually turns the stool black or tarry The pain in your upperright abdomen could be caused by many conditions including gallstones Because the pain has persisted for over 2 weeks Id suggest you get it checked out The pain may or may not be related to the other symptoms you describe Only a medical professional can give you a firm diagnosis I hope you feel better soon My best advice in situations like this is dont give up Some conditions can take years to diagnose so its crucial for the patient to routinely follow up on symptoms new and old I suggest your husband continue to seek a diagnosis for his ailment Id suggest he return periodically to report his symptoms havent improved and have tests repeated at appropriate intervals Sometimes just getting a long medical history recorded can lead a health care provider to see a pattern emerge which in turn can lead to a diagnosis Meanwhile make sure your husband maintains good hydration because chronic diarrhea can be very dehydrating Also you might consider keeping a log to record the datestimes of his bowel movements and also what he eats Sometimes correlating these two factors can help with diagnosis too Wishing you both all the best Its good of you to be aware of this potential complication of antibiotics the infection Azithromycin Zpack isnt as wellassociated with as broadspectrum antibiotics like penicillin or cephalosporins are but I still would suggest you take your daughter to the doctor for this I mean having diarrhea 10 days after finishing a course of antibiotics isnt normal and that alone warrants having it checked out Until you can get your daughter in to see the doctor this isnt something you need to go to the emergency room for be sure to keep your daughter wellhydrated I usually suggest drinking plenty of plain water with a glass of sports drink thrown in every now and then for electrolyte balance You also can water down a sports drink by half with water Mainly just fluids fluids fluids Also its crucially important your daughter washes her hands thoroughly with soap and water each time she goes to the bathroom is not affected by hand sanitizers Lots of handwashing will help keep this from spreading if it is in fact  I hope your daughter feels better soon Im sorry to hear youre going through this It sounds like a difficult situation Id recommend you go back to your gynecologist to discuss this situation I cant think of any reason why youd have gas constipation and diarrhea while on your period now when you didnt before Also the hot flashes sound like a hormone issue Your gynecologist will want to know about these symptoms in case your pills need to be changed Because youve been on the pills only two months it may be too early to tell if these symptoms will resolve on their own or not But thats not really the issue The issue is that youre experiencing new symptoms and youre concerned about them That alone warrants a visit with your doctor I wish you all the best at getting this resolved Im sorry to hear youve been going through this Nobody likes being ill Many different conditions could cause what youre describing One likely candidate is  Certain types of food poisoning can cause bloody stool These types often are accompanied by a high fever over 101F You should seek medical attention if your symptoms havent cleared up within a few days If this is indeed food poisoning it probably will go away on its own Meanwhile you need to be sure to drink plenty of fluids to avoid becoming dehydrated Assuming youre otherwise healthy I often recommend halfstrength Gatorade or a few glasses of water alternating with one glass of Gatorade to help you stay hydrated and maintain electrolyte balance One thing you dont want to do is take an overthecounter antidiarrhea preparation If this does turn out to be food poisoning diarrhea is your bodys way of getting rid of the toxin So if things dont clear up within a few days see a health care professional before you think about treating yourself Feel better soon Because you vomited after taking the  Id suggest you contact the health care provider who prescribed it to let them know This can signal an allergic reaction but it could also have happened simply because you were nervous about taking the antibiotic Let me reassure you that your doctor would not have prescribed azithromycin knowing you were pregnant unless he or she thought it was safe for you That said I would definitely suggest you get in touch with your doctor to discuss your concerns the vomiting and diarrhea and see if he or she can prescribe something else for you I also invite you to participate in  where you can connect with experts and other momstobe Wishing you and your baby all the best Im sorry to hear youre dealing with this It sounds exhausting Although you dont have insurance you need to get checked out by a doctor Chronic can have many bad side effects such as causing a mineral imbalance that affects your heart Most cities even small ones offer free or lowcost health care clinics Some of these clinics allow people to pay on a sliding fee scale This means the fee is based on your income and expenses You can get information about these clinics by contacting your local Medicaid office Or use a search engine and type in the name of your city followed by free health clinics Meanwhile its very important you drink plenty of water Chronic diarrhea can cause severe dehydration I wish you all the best in getting the problem diagnosed and treated Your story illustrates why its so important to give a complete medical history to your health care provider on each visit Im wondering if the person who prescribed the penicillin knew you had just gotten over a bout of  If so then I would assume its OK to take the penicillin If not then I would suggest you call the prescribing physician tell them about your bout with colitis and ask about the penicillin treatment In the case of  antibiotics usually are given to shorten the period of time during which youre contagious Antibiotics also helps prevent the spread of strep to other parts of the body There are many different strains of Streptococcus bacteria some of them are more dangerous than others As I said your best bet is to ask the prescribing physician about taking penicillin after recovering from a recent bout of colitis That way you will have a positive answer to your question Take care Its difficult to say if these things are interrelated You might have constipationdiarrhea even if you didnt have anxietypanic attacks Lets take on the bowel problem first Whenever your bowels arent behaving themselves you should start with the basics Make sure you eat plenty of foods rich in fiber These can include fruits including dried fruit vegetables and whole grains Fiber helps move material through your intestines If you dont get enough fiber you can become constipated  Make sure youre drinking enough water Dehydration can lead to constipation Interestingly while too little fiber can cause constipation it also can lead to loose stools or diarrhea  If you have loose stools try increasing your fiber intake But stay away from fruits temporarily because eating fruit in large quantities can give you very loose stools Make sure youre exercising Exercise including walking can literally help get things moving in your bowels if youre constipated And exercise in general will help your body including your bowels function better If eating plenty of fiber drinking plenty of water and getting exercise dont solve your bowel issues then you should consult a medical professional Its possible you have irritable bowel syndrome or another condition that can or needs to be treated with medication Regarding the anxiety and panic attacks if youre not under the care of a psychologist for these conditions then I suggest you see someone Anxiety is very treatable today And since panic attacks often arise from unchecked anxiety treating your anxiety may make the panic attacks go away Wishing you well Sounds more like allergy symptoms We had this same exact thing happen it is completly normal and has to do with the beginning of teething We switched to a rice cereal for this which seemed to help a little and also used the triplepaste diaper rash gel It helped a ton with the rash Nothing to worry about though as I said this is normal and will pass as hard as it is watching your baby scream when you wipe them with this terrible rash some people are different to them really bad cramps if you know what IM SAYING IM A WOMEN TOO ZPak or azithromycin does have common side effects of stomach upset and diarrhea Taking this medication with food may help with your upset stomach If your diarrhea becomes more intense it is important to stay hydrated by taking in fluids and replenishing your electrolytes The diarrhea should subside within a few days to a week after you have finished the medication If the side effects are unbearable talk to your health care provider about prescribing another antibiotic Just remember that all antibiotics can have an effect on the normal flora of your GI tract Common side effects for this medication include diarrhea dizziness drowsiness gas headache indigestion nausea stomach pain or upset and vomiting Your upset stomach can be minimized by taking the enteric coated form do not break or crush as well as taking the medication with food If the side effects worsen over time consult your health care provider or pharmacist to find a medication that is right for you Yes Definitely see a doctor right away Darkening of your stool could be an indication of internal bleeding I am 30 years old and not pregnant either but have been bloated nauseous and burping for two months now I fill full all the time My sister started with similar symptons three weeks ago now Something is very strange about this We thought it could be the winter weather change due to lack of sunlight I eat a very healthy and bland diet and feel very healthy otherwise I do not take any drugs not even birth control My sister thinks we have too much melatonin hormone She read in a hormone book that we may have high levels in the winter that remain in our gut and cause high acid levels in the stomach thus creating bloating and gas I thought I may have cysts so I went to the doctor for that but all was fine We are trying light therapy too so the daytime melatonin is not produced I am only five days into that These are always tricky areas because I have to ask my patients a lot of questions First of all I have to ask who is it for and how long have you had it Because in some cases if you have diarrhea or constipation it could be related to another condition So I will ask my patients have you referred this to your doctor or other healthcare provider because there may be some other things going on Children too I tend to be more along the lines of calling a pediatrician first before making any recommendations because it could be a virus In some cases the best therapy is just giving them some Pedialyte keeping them hydrated giving them some Tylenol possibly for their fever but not really using things like Imodium or PeptoBismol because that might keep the virus inside and therefore they are not going to get better So there are a few things that I need to know Constipation is always a problem But once again it comes down to have the pharmacist asking you some questions A lot of medications are constipating so if I find out through your medication list you should have a list of all your medications at all times and carry it with you that you are on certain pain medications or certain antidepressants these can all cause constipation So you may have to change your diet Thats usually the number one way we want to go when treating constipation is lifestyle modifications Adding more fiber to your diet Increase your water intake And not rush the harsh things like laxatives Stool softeners are really safe in women Women become constipated when they get pregnant So therefore stool softeners are safe for using them along with changing their diet a little bit So there are a lot of different options that are available for patients but pharmacists are going to ask you a lot of questions so be prepared to open up a little bit so I can help you out Diarrhea is a condition that once again as a pharmacist I can tell you all the time I ask a lot of questions especially around the fact of are you running a fever How long have you had the diarrhea for Is the diarrhea  do you have dark though diarrhea Because that could be a sign of internal bleeding So you want to be very careful about the suggestions that we make In the case of diarrhea too medications sometimes arent always the best choice You want to change your diet You want to make sure that you are hydrated A lot of people forget that when you have diarrhea you lose a lot of fluids So you want to do rehydration first Things like pedialyte increasing your water intake and then introducing all foods in general Typically in the past there was something called the BRAT Diet which was bran rice applesauce and toast to help with diarrhea That actually is not the recommendation anymore they actually want people to start eating pretty normally to get their body back in balance as well as increasing their fluids Only then if there are some problems where they say you know Ive been increasing my diet I still have a little bit of diarrhea Imodium or something like that be appropriate But we do need to ask a few questions to find out what is really going on Based on three medications I am unaware of anything such as a sideeffect of that happening But I would question this patient as to why they are on Zegerid and Protonix They actually are both proton pump inhibitors and if they are taking them at the same time I would question as to why Because generally you are on one or the other not both So as a pharmacist if a patient came to me and asked me this question I would ask him can you tell me what other medications you are taking Through a medication list I would be able to say hey this might be one of the problems Contact the physician or healthcare provider and then let the patient know whether or not they need to be switched discontinue one find out what is really going on But that is a common thing that pharmacists do encounter everyday Thats what were doing we are checking to make sure that there is no drug interactions or in this case duplication of therapy There are a few more questions that I would need to ask How old is the infant and how long has the diarrhea been going on Is the child running a fever Diarrhea can be dangerous in an infant because it can cause dehydration rather quickly Infants dont know they should be drinking water and eating to help replenish essential nutrients so if this has been going on for more than a day my suggestion is to call your doctor or health care provider immediately to let them know what is going on Good question  mild diarrhea is common with antibiotic use However a more serious form of diarrhea pseudomembranous colitis may rarely occur This may develop while you use the antibiotic or within several months after you stop using it Contact your health care provider right away if stomach pain or cramps severe diarrhea or bloody stools occur Do not treat diarrhea even with Imodium without first checking with your doctor or health care provider  Mild diarrhea is common with antibiotic use However a more serious form of diarrhea pseudomembranous colitis may rarely occur This may develop while you use the antibiotic or within several months after you stop using it Contact your healthcare provider right away if stomach pain or cramps severe diarrhea or bloody stools occur Do not treat diarrhea even with Imodium without first checking with your doctor or healthcare provider Hi sorry to hear thatif its more than 2 days now and shes experiencing the same symptoms please take her to a doctor Im a mother of 4 grown children She may be lactose or casein intolerant which comes from many dairy products or it could be another form of stomach problem She may have caught a bug at school or have a virus A long time ago my little brother had the tummy flu so my dad gave him a pitcher to throw up in but he threw up on the stupid bed Oh well Hes much better XD Can cause that and or constipation consult your doctor and possibly change to something else before things get worse No You should not give PeptoBismol to children under the age of 12 If your son has had diarrhea for three days it is important for you to consult the pediatrician to find out what is causing it Pedialyte can help him avoid becoming dehydrated But he needs to be examined by a doctor as soon as possible First check with his physicians who have been treating him since February and get their OK to start exercising Also ask the docter who is treating his heart if he has any restrictions on liftsexercises that use his arms or chest Generally patients are not allowed to lift more than 5 pounds after pacemaker insertion for the first several weeks Also when you talk to his physicians ask about physical therapy or cardiac rehab Due to his extensive list of injuries and illnesses in the past few months a medically managed program might be a better option than home exercise I have pasted some links below that describe what cardiac rehab consists of http http After you have gotten all of his physicians clearance to start exercising begin with just a few exercises and increase the time he exercises slowly For example 1 3 times a day have him walk for five minutes around the house If he is having balance issues make sure he uses a cane or walker if one has been prescribed If not walk with him and give assistance as needed 2 1 time a day do the sit to stand exercise Have him sit in a chair and stand up then sit back down To increase the intensity you can choose a chair that siits lower to the ground or have him not use his arms If getting out of a chair is a problem decrease the depth by placing a couple of telephone books in the seat of the chair 31 time a day do a hip flexion exercise Sitting in a chair have him lift his knee and thigh upward about 6 inches To increase the intensity put a handweight or heavy item on his thigh 4 Start the sit to stands and hip flexion exercise with 1 set of 5 repetitions and slowly increase both to 3 sets of 10 repetitons Meaning have him perform 10 repetitions rest then perform 10 more then rest again and perform 10 more I know this doesnt sound like much but its a great place to start The walking will increase his endurance and the 2 strengthening exerices will make it easier for him to get up out of bed and from a chair Look for resources in the community Is there a silver sneakers program in your town or any programs designed exclusively for individuals in his age group Besides the benefits of exercise they also provide a great social outlet Many women suffer from IBS  its not clear whether it is related to menopausal hormone changes or not but it certainly is also very common as we get older A couple of thoughts that Ive learned from my friends who are gastroenterologists Have you tried a fibercontaining product like Metamucil or Citrucel Many GI folks recommend it and if you havent its probably worth a try Another product that many of them recommend for my patients is a fancy probiotic called Align  its available over the counter and it is supposed to be an excellent bacteria for the intestines Even if you have tried other probiotics its probably worth a try Another and more esoteric thought is evening primrose oil  there are a couple of papers in the literature from many years ago touting its use in women with PMS  and I have a few patients who tell me it has helped them  so its probably worth a try Again finding a good gastroenterologist is a good idea to try to help get you through these episodes  and again the local county medical society is a good starting place if you dont feel comfortable with your GI doc I wish there was an easy diet answer for IBS sufferers but you are going to have to do some investigative work to find what and how much of certain foods you have trouble tolerating That being said most people with IBS have problems with greasy foods spicy foods caffeinecontaining beverages coffee and tea and alcohol Certain foods can increase gastrointestinal discomfort when eaten in large amounts such as beans cabbage cauliflower peas and Brussels sprouts Most IBS sufferers do better with smaller frequent meals 56 times daily instead of big meals less frequently 23 big meals I recommend you see registered dietitian RD that performs elimination

Tell the doctor that you are unemployed and are having money problems Most doctors that I know will try to help you by reducing the fee or working out some type of payment plan He or she will also know what resources are available in the area and can give you further advice If you do not have a family doctor your city or county may have a free clinic But this will only help you if you can be seen right away Some areas have urgent care centers that may be able to see you right away for a fee If there is no way that you can see a doctor right now then you can go to the emergency room of your local hospital Once this health crisis has passed look into whether you can get help from the government You are eligible for Medicare If you are over 65 If you are younger and meet certain financial criteria you may be able to get medical assistance I hope you get the help you need now There could be a couple of things going on First antibiotics can cause diarrhea That diarrhea usually goes away once you stop the antibiotic Taking probiotics may help You can get probiotics either by eating yogurt look for live active cultures on the label or by taking probiotic supplements For supplements look for these probiotics  Saccharomyces boulardii and Lactobacillus GG  as they may work the best Probiotics for Diarrhea httpwwwwebmdcomdigestivedisordersprobioticsdiarrhea However another concern is that you could have a condition called Clostridium difficile also called C diff which is an infection that happens after you take antibiotics Cipro is one of the antibiotics that more commonly causes C diff We see this more in people treated with antibiotics in the hospital However it can happen in anyone taking antibiotics C diff is often treated with one of the antibiotics you were on  Flagyl Clostridium difficile httpwwwwebmdcomdigestivedisorderstcclostridiumdifficilecolitisoverview If you try the probiotics for 23 days and that doesnt get rid of the diarrhea you need to let your doctor know as you may need other treatment Also if the diarrhea gets worse or you develop new symptoms also let your doctor know I am not a vet but I do have 3 dogs and 3 cats so I have a lot of personal experience with pets I would be concerned about the dog dragging his back legs That is not something that would generally be caused by the routine causes of diarrhea I am pretty confident any veterinarian would suggest the dog needs to be seen probably sooner than later That is not something that over the counter meds would be able to treat Preparation H Could be CDiff go the

it can be dangerous I was very sick the same way Turned out my gallbladder was not working correctly I would have that checked Ive read the stomach bug Norovirus attacks the small intestine and the body then releases antibodies that kill off the lining of the small intestine to fight off the virus This would probably be shed as mucus in the diarrhea Thats one possibility Depends on how much has consumed Remember Lettuce is mostly water and roughage Consider also where the Lettuce came from  as if a salad bar  there may be bacteria such as ecoli or salmonella Best to have a stool culture taken if this continues beyond two days People just simply refuse to wash their hands  and contamination spreads Also depending on sprays  if it was washed before it was consumed Thankyou for your reply She doesnt eat junk food really Apart from maybe some chips occasionally She eats 23 pieces of fruit a day although she doesnt eat all of it She doesn t drink milk only watered rice milk when going to bed a small amount Travelers diarrhea is often used as a generic term for any illnesses ranging from an upset tummy to loose stools during or after travel It could mean just excess gas or a variety of symptoms that can occur from a change in the types of food or beverages we are used to  or most commonly to contamination of food or beverages And its not just food and beverages Touching your mouth or nose with contaminated hands may be all it takes People often discuss the importance of care in selecting safe foods and beverages for consumption We recommend that foods be freshly cooked and be piping hot such foods are safer than those on a buffet that have been sitting out for hours Water should be bottled and sealed or boiled Alcohol is OK but ice cubes are not But sometimes people do everything they are supposed to do regarding the selection of food and beverages and still get sick Often its really the lack of sanitation within the food industry  contamination may occur anywhere from when the food comes out of the ground to the preparer or the server Food can be tainted at any point along that route So restaurant hygiene and food service worker hygiene may be out of the travelers control but both play a role in whether disease is transmitted And sometimes its the travelers who contaminate themselves Remember Try to clean your hands before eating whether with soap and water or a hand sanitizer And travelers should avoid touching their face mouth or mucous membranes with their hands Yes PeptoBismol has been used for a number of years to prevent travelers diarrhea Studies show that if adults take the equivalent of two tabs four times a day it can decrease the incidence of travelers diarrhea up to 60 Now many people who take that amount of PeptoBismol end up with severe constipation I take two tabs twice a day when I go into a risky situation I do believe that it is very helpful but most recommend if youre going to do this that it should just be for shortterm  up to three weeks While this helps many people those allergic to aspirin cannot take it And if youre taking prescription medications you should check with your doctor to see if you can take this Some swear by probiotics like lactobacillus for preventing travelers diarrhea But studies of this strategy in limited numbers of subjects are inconclusive And some people are given prophylactic antibiotics which are very effective in preventing travelers diarrhea but the problem there is we dont feel very good about prescribing antibiotics for a number of reasons for someone if they dont need them There are issues such as side effects or of diarrhea caused by the antibiotics themselves and increased antibiotic resistance in the normal organisms we harbor in our bodies Rarely if it is just for a very important weekend or occasionally for government officials or someone in an athletic competition we may prescribe preventive antibiotics Its due to eating different kinds of foods such as much more spicy food or more fat than in our normal diets That is not something we typically pay as much attention to avoiding when we travel but we have to be wary of these things Not every change in our bowel habits is due to infection Infection is the most important cause of travelers diarrhea and most is caused by bacteria Some people are more susceptible than others its not clear why that is You can be with a group and all consume the same thing and some get sick while others do not There are a host factors involved Stomach acid is our first defense mechanism against organisms that we ingest Therefore those on antacids or who just have low stomach acid often get travelers diarrhea more easily People who have underlying diseases of the gut such as Crohns disease or AIDS may be more susceptible to certain types of organisms causing travelers diarrhea For the most part were talking about bacterial infections Almost 90 of travelers diarrhea cases are caused by bacteria The enterotoxigenic E coli ETEC strains of common bacteria that produce a toxin affecting the gut are the most important cause And then there are others such as salmonella shigella campylobacter vibrio and others that are less common Travelers diarrhea may also be caused by viruses such as norovirus which is in the news a lot because of how quickly it can spread through a cruise ship Parasitic travelers diarrhea is yet another kind Giardia intestinalis is the most common of these but there is a large number of parasites that can cause diarrhea These are less frequent Sometimes it starts with fever and chills You may get cramps and then of course very urgent loose stools in various amounts Sometimes there is vomiting or bloody diarrhea With norovirus onset can be sudden and vomiting is a much more prominent feature For bacterial and viral travelers diarrhea the incubation period is typically six to 48 hours after infection For protozoan travelers diarrhea there is usually more of a gradual onset with a few loose stools per day and increased gas and nausea The incubation period can be one to two weeks Hydration is the primary treatment Often people with a bout of travelers diarrhea feel so weak A good deal of it is due to dehydration Its not OK just to take a few sips of cola You need to make the effort to drink a lot of fluid because often youve lost a lot more than you think In a lot of cases just clean water is OK Better if you are very dehydrated is a rehydration solution Rehydration packets are a great thing to have especially if you are going to remote areas or places off the usual tourist paths When we look at antidiarrheal agents the most important are those that stop symptoms immediately such as Imodium and Lomotil We prefer Imodium because it does not make you feel drugged and sleepy but does stop your symptoms Note Imodium is one of several brand names for loperamide Lomotil and Lonox are brand names for diphenoxylate combined with atropine Remember that these agents do not cure the illness They just stop you up and thus stop the cramping These drugs are fine to take immediately right after you feel that urge and pass that first loose stool It will make you feel better faster Some people think that it is not a good idea to take agents such as these with diarrhea because its better to purge all the bad stuff thats in you But a number of studies show taking something like Imodium does not prolong illness Now people with high fever or bloody stools or terrible abdominal symptoms should NOT take these drugs They should seek medical attention For people with mild to moderate travelers diarrhea there is nothing wrong with taking Imodium and a dose of antibiotic at the same time For mild diarrhea if you do not have an antibiotic or are just looking for temporary relief it is fine to take these drugs without an antibiotic But if youre looking for a cure and want and need to move on with your travels in general it is good to take an antibiotic as well One to three days of antibiotics will cure most cases of travelers diarrhea It depends For adults ciprofloxacin is used most commonly Sometimes for those traveling to certain places in Southeast Asia where bacterial pathogens have increased resistance some doctors like to prescribe azithromycin In some cases where you feel that the traveler may likely be exposed to just the coliform pathogens such as E coli some prescribe rifaximin Of course antibiotics work only for bacterial causes of travelers diarrhea Know that even bacterial travelers diarrhea usually gets better without antibiotic treatment although rehydration is always advised and symptoms may take 3 to 5 days or more to subside without treatment For those with diarrhea due to parasitic infections there are agents that are specific for each type of infection However for Giardia infections tinidazole Tindamax is often prescribed and is very effective Actually for selftreatment in the field we dont really encourage travelers to touch base with a provider before starting treatment Many travelers will be in areas where providers may not be up to the standard of care that travelers are used to or may be in places where the medications they can obtain are not safe  there is a big market in counterfeit medications in some developing nations So we urge people to get the medications they may need  and some education on when and how to use them  from their provider before traveling Then they can selftreat as long as they have only a mild to moderate case of travelers diarrhea Kids can become dehydrated far quicker than adults Rehydration solutions are more important for children right from the outset Doctors are now becoming more open to prescribing antibiotics that children can take in case they get travelers diarrhea Azithromycin can be useful in children Parents should check with their pediatricians before leaving home Nursing mothers should continue to breastfeed The time to wean a child is not in the middle of travel Continue even if the mother has diarrhea  but she must ensure that she is getting plenty of hydration You need to go see your gyno or family doc If you are sick it could easily affect your period Its not necessarily the diarrhea thats messing it up your body could just not be bleeding to save energy for dealing with you being sick It wouldnt hurt to call your doctor to make sure he or she doesnt think anything else is wrong but anything that stresses out your body extreme exercise extreme diet weight loss illness can alter your menstruation In adults Imodium can be taken up to four times a day for two days for the managment of diarrhea It will likely remain in your system for at least a halfday but the effects of this drug are not the same in all people Some people require taking this medication after each loose bowel movement up to four times a day while others may not need such a high dose Any beneficial response would likely be highly individualized If your surgeon recommended this medication for your particular condition heshe would likely be the best source for a patientspecific recommendation Noit should not be a problem Your contraception should still be effective even if you had diarrhea an hour later If your twomonth old baby truly has diarrhea frequent watery stools then you need to have himher seen by the pediatrician Babies tend to have a certain number of normal watery stools anyway but if they are sick and have frequent bowel movement at this young age they have a chance of becoming dehydrated Dehydration where the mouth becomes dry and there are not tears can quickly become very serious in babies of this age There are NOT overthecounter treatments that you can use on a baby but you must make sure the babys fluids are being replaced breast milk formula electrolyte solutions for infants etc Please call the babys pediatrician  someone who knows your child  for specific advice I suspect the doctor will want to see him Diarrhea is not a symptom that is consistent with influenza Influenza is a respiratory disease with fever yes it can be as high as 103 and coughing body aches chills etc If your daughter is having severe diarrhea influenza is not the cause and a flu vaccine would not have prevented this gastroenteritis She most definitely picked up a pathogen of some sort usually a virus but she will need to see a medical provider for a proper examination See a urologist You are having symptoms suggestive of prostatitis an infection or inflammation in the prostate gland I am not sure if there is a relationship with your boweldiarrhea and fatigue issues so this could easily be an entirely separate medical problem You are probably finetemporarily immune to the bug that you just had but please keep in mind that there are more than one species of viruses that cause gastroenteritis If you daughter is schoolaged she could easily bring home a different one for you to enjoy for another week Cross your fingers and wash those hands Pancreatic cancer cannot be diagnosed by a simple blood test with borderline results but any person with abdominal discomfort for as long as you have suffered needs a very thorough diagnostic workup and imaging studies A reason for your nausea and diarrhea as well as a solution needs to be found Rather than just worry about pancreatic cancer you should continue the active pursuit as to the cause of your symptoms Yes and it is also time not to go to Jack in the Box I am not saying that the fast food at fastfood is diarrheaprovoking but it may be in your case It could be the fat content of the food you are selecting or other factors Certain foods are known to trigger gastointestinal responses Most of the cases of diarrhea we see clinically are viral and they only last a week Diarrhea lasting three weeks certainly deserves some medical attention It can so please inform your medical provider You are on a antibiotic regime often used for MRSA so do not stop your medications unless your medical provider specifically tells you to do so You did not ask a particular question but I can comment Any person who been coughing for a month needs to be examined to determine the reason Since you are also having nauseavomiting which may or may not be related this is another reason for you to see a medical provider so you can be properly diagnosed and treated  two things that cannot be done blindly over the Internet No an ingrown toenail will not cause diarrhea There are no rules in medicine that states that a person can only have one medical problem at a time or that all symtpoms have to be connect to just one condition So the diarrhea is due to something else If you are taking antibiotics for your ingrown nail then that can cause diarrhea Every human on this planet has Ecoli in their intestines This is the part of our normal intestinal flora We do not however have the 0157 strain that causes lifethreating health consequences unless we got if from a contaminated source Bloody diarrhea is not likely from too much olive oil so I would encourage you to seek medical care There are many other bacterial forms of diarrhea that can cause this Insurance or not your health is worth spending money just like you would spend money to fix your caror your computeror cell phone True travelers diarrhea is a bacterial infection often due to enteric Ecoli but parasites and viruses can cause diarrhea too Heard about those cruise ships I dont think this had anything to do with your Nexium The advice that you can eat anything was not intended to say that Nexium prevents foodborne pathogen infections That is one way a woman gets a UTI very very rare with men however Your first and mostimportant step is to be properly diagnosed You will need to see a medical professional  your primary care provider or gastroenterologist  so you can be properly examined and diagnosed There are sooooo many causes of chronic diarrhea that it would impossible to determine a cause or a solution blindly over the Internet Viral gastroenteritis is very prevalent this time of year Please keep in mind that this is just a blind guess since I have no way of examining you The most important thing is FLUID REPLACEMENT You must stay wellhydrated Dont eat very much for a few more daysmost of these viral infections resolve in about 710 days so hang in there At least you are not vomiting so be greatful In my practice we do not treat diarrhea with drugs at least at this stage but your doctor may have other ideas Your stomach pain may be cramps or gas but if you are concerned the only way that you can be sure is to see your medical provider so you can be examined Yesyou can use probiotics but that will not solve the sore bottom Not all diaper rashes are the samesome are caused simply by the acidic irritation of having diarrhea but some can be yeast or even bacterial Each would be treated differently of course Since I cant diagnose your baby over the Internet I can make a little suggestion that I use for my own patients Use a combination of an antiyeast cream over the counterthe pharmacist can help you pick one AND 1 hydrocortisone cream for the inflammation Rub a small amount well in those sore areas and then cover this with a barrier cream or ointment AD Desitin zinc oxide Vaseline etc Change the diaper frequently and make sure you wipe of ALL traces of stool even if you have to give them a bath If the area is bleeding or getting worse you will need to have it examined by the pediatrician There is no way to calculate an individuals HIV risk from just one encounter but you did have some very risky sexunprotected open wound on penis bleeding female partner and someone whos sexual history is unknown I would strongly suggest that you see your medical provider so you can be properly examined and have STD testing especially for HIV Yes a person can have a gastointestinal virus without vomiting or diarrhea but those symptoms are typically the things you get If you had this virus before or a similar virus you may only have a mild infection with nausea You cannot definitively diagnose a Norovirus by symptoms alone since everyone responds to a viral infection differently I do not know anything about your mother or her medical history but I would be concerned as well I cannot imagine that six days into a potent antibiotic course that she would be having UTI symptoms The vact that her BP is low her heart rate is high and she is having difficulty breathing would not likely be related to the UTI She needs to see her regular medical provider as soon as possible for an examination Cefdinir should be out of your system in a day or sorelatively fast but that does not mean your diarrhea assuming it was caused by this antibiotic will immediately stop True influenza is respiratory not intestinal so I would be conerned that your mucous secretions would be related to an infection or inflammation in your colon There can be many different reasons Yes you should be concerned See your medical provider so that you can be properly diagnosed and treated Pepto Bismol can cause the stools to be darker but not BLACK and TARRY and not likely five minutes after you took it This may be a sign of a gastrointestinal bleed especially the stomach I would strongly suggest that you see or consult your medical provider as soon as possible Most definitely A person can have a blockage of dry hard stool constipation and still have a leakage of watery stool diarrhea around the hard constipated plug We can even see this on abdominal xrays The first treatment step in this case would be to get the constipated stool properly managed Unfortunately I do not know anything about your sonlike the reason he is taking the cefdinir or if he could possibly have another reason to account for the diarrhea Maintaining HYDRATION is the most important thing for you to do so Pedialyte should be your friend Please work closely with the medical provider who is treating him  someone who knows his case can assess his level of hydration etc  things that cannot be accomplished blindly over the Internet No spicy food does not cause ovarian problems Your GI system is the likely source if there is a relationship Have you been taking Pepto Bismol This can turn the stool black but some can blood If you are not taking Pepto then it would be best to see your medical provider The simple answer is nothing Diarrhea is a purging mechanism so the body can eliminate toxins poisons created by the viral pathogens Diarrhea although it can be inconvenient is really helpful in getting him well Some of these illnesses can last a week but diarrhea lasting longer than this time or very severe diarrhea that may contain blood in the stools should be brought to the immediate attention of his pediatrician or medical provider The most important thing for you to do is maintain adequate hydration Water electrolyte solution like Pedialyte juices yogurt etc are all helpful A diet containing rice applesauce toast or bananas have been helpful as well Since he is diapered you can contain the watery stools most of the time but make sure to change him after stooling as quickly as you can since diarrhea can lead to a nasty diaper rash Use a coating of vaseline or other protective barriers in the diaper area is helpful In no time his diarrhea should slow down stop and then his bowel movements should return to normal Give up on the whole milk for a while until the diarrhea clears and then start back on lactosefree milk Lactaid to see what happens Keep in mind that there are many things that can cause loose stools in children so dont automatically blame the whole milk but lactose intolerance is a possibility Can she eat yogurt cheese or even ice cream Have tried plain old boring aspirin I know its fallen out of favor but its always been my goto pain med for most of my needs If I need a little extra oomph I add a little caffeine I use the non buffered kind for better absorption That might cause you stomach troubles though and the caffeine could possibly as well if you are sensitive to it Depending on the pain and its reason sometimes going to the source of it can help too Like a heating pad for arthritis a salt water gargle for a sore throat a scalp massage for headache that kind of thing If you have problems with diarrhea you may also want to look at the kinds of foods you are eating and if they could be contributing A bland diet with some live culture yogurt can hep a lot My secret weapon against diarrhea is matzoh crackers because they are dry and absorb liquid Saltines work too but not as well Hope you feel better soon Before you think of something like pancreatitis check simpler solutions like a bacterial infection Meanwhile keep hydrated and eat bland foods and get plenty of rest Dry crackers will help absorb fluid The unabsorbed food is probably being caused by your body rushing your food through your system too fast Sounds like you are dehydrated Drink plenty of fluids  your muscles need water  fluids to help them work correctly Sure hope youve gone to a doctor by now Yes you should go to a doctor if your system starts to operate differently than it usually does Hope you are well by now I hope after 3 days you are either feeling better or have gone to see someone If your BM is quite bloody you should see someone soon If it isnt too bloody a doctor visit or urgent care center would be okay There are a couple of bacterial infections that produce bloody diarrhea You MAY need an antibiotic you could be dehydrating while you are sleeping I have done this a couple of times  My youngest child never had a sore throat with strep When he went back to school every year I could count on a call from the nurse within two or three months and it would be strep He would have a rash on his torso and no other symptoms You have al the signs of dehydration and hypovolemia from poor fluid intake which causes your blood pressure to go down especially when you first stand up Since you are keeping food down now then I would try to find foods with the highest protein content like eggs peanut butter beans also fruit such as blueberries strawberries bananaswhich have a high potassium content that you loose with vomitingdiarrhea Doctors usually define diarrhea as a significant increase in the total weight of stool passed in a single day Most people however think of diarrhea as an illness during which they have more frequent loose watery stools Almost everyone has diarrhea at some point in his or her life In developing countries where illnesses that cause diarrhea are more common and where health care is less readily available diarrhea is a major health concern because of its potential to cause severe lifethreatening dehydration Infants and the elderly are more prone to dehydration from diarrhea Diarrhea that comes on suddenly and goes away over a period of a couple of weeks is usually referred to as acute diarrhea Most people with acute diarrhea recover on their own Diarrhea that lasts more than four weeks is thought of as chronic diarrhea Typically chronic diarrhea requires medical care to find the underlying cause and treat complications such as dehydration I cant seem to stop the diarrhea and have lost 3 pounds Every time I hydrate I end up with bright yellow watery and oily diarrhea Suggestions to control the diarrhea or do I need to see a doctor I also have a slight headache too Is passing of loss stool 23 times in one day Hi it is possible Sounds like typical diarrhea to me You should maybe revel in the fact that its just once a year You might want to try and think through what you ate or drank when this happened in the past and stay away from those things If it totally makes you sad you should talk to your doctor Ask your doctor about Lexapro taken daily It has helped me to deal with the chronic anxietystress and depression from Crohns and its effect on me physically and socially possible food poisining take pepto bismol take pepto bismol there may be a chance that your baby is intolerant to lactose i would take her to the doctor and demand action for the moment you could feed your baby cooled boiled water to ensure that she is receiving enough fluid the body can cope better without food than it can without fluid i hope you find this useful and i hope your baby feels better soon You just said that you go once per week then you just added that you can go three times in a dayIm a bit confused but I would suggest taking metamucil tabs aka pysllium husk supllements to increase fiber and help regulate yourself If that doesnt help after a week I would contact the doctor Radiating heat around the sting sights as well as reddening and swelling is normal for the amount of stings and being from a wasp As a fact you can have the same problems with just one sting However you are doing the right things medically as you can May take 3 days to a week for the heat and swelling to subside Have you been to the dentist It could be an abscessed tooth in your upper jaw i have them 4 to 5 times a day since he is a diabetic you need to have him see a doctor right away Has the Drs tested for wheat or gluten intollerance If possible have a separate test done for wheat and a separate test done for gluten You can have the intollerance for one and not the other Is your child lactose intollerant have anemia or thyroid condition You can research for Celiac Sprue disease for more information and clues Celiac is an intollerance to both Hope this helps strongly recommend second opinion  if diarrhea has yellow tint probable cdiff u need act asap Two basic possibilities a food poisoning or what is sometimes called stomach flu and b some more lasting problem Either way you need to stay hydrated and go see a doctor Most definitely YES  Blood in the stool in never normal and from what you have described it is very serious indeed If you have lost a significant amount of blood through this it can be a lifethreatening situation No according to depoprovera cl side effect information that i found u can look it up wwwrxlistcom hope this helps I was always told to give my babies pedialyte to keep them from dehydrating and to replenish the electrolyte in their tiny bodies as for the raw bottom cornstarch or the diaper rash ointments that are thick and white not petroleum jelly types work best I have found Sounds like food poisoningfrom undercooked food I would seek medical treatment Get tested parasitic infection Try the BRAT diet if you have not already Its strictly Banana Rice Apple sauce not sweetened and Toast dry DO NOT CHEAT while on the BRAT diet Not even a bite And only drink water Eat this way until you have solid bowel movements for a day Then reintroduce bland foods The bland meal I always have to follow up is plain chicken breast yam and rice If the stool gets loose again go back to the BRAT for another day or two I used this remedy with my children whenever they had diarrhea and it worked like a charm eat more fiber and check diet alot more water stick to less gassygreasy foods and eat less I agree with that answer If you have it available White Mountain Bulgarian Yogurt has those and no additives It also has 90 billion probiotics per one cup serving It will definitely make a person feel better It is possible Those tests arent always 100 accurate Id see a doctor to be absolutely sure I hope you get to have a child soon Its the Pepto It happens to me every time I take it and if you read all the warnings on the package it even says you may notice a change in your stool color Nothing to be too alarmed by but if youre still taking the Pepto try laying off for a day or two and see if that helps It could be a really bad virus or ibs It may also be chrons disease I ve had it for the past 12 years and that is how mine started Good luck to you too much fat in stools cause by pancerous not working rightshe needs to see a Pediatriciannot a FAMILY DR could also be related to digestive tract issues Take care of your diarrhea firstGet a good doctor who speicalizes in that area Get off the soft drinks The diarrhea is draining out all energy You can die from diarrhea that last for a long period of time The only way to know is to get tested If the sex worker was HIV positive then yes there is a chance since the condom slipped off and fluids were exchanged Dont wait get tested right away if you didnt drink alot in the first place it could be your body flushing its self if you dont drink alot of water and then you start all at onec only drinking water you will have a clencing cycle if i my I would take himher now that way they can look at her and get a better understanding of what is going on Sounds like your stools are just a bit out of wack A laxative can cause diarrhea so that part is normal The question is why did you think you needed one To get your stools back on track increase your daily amount of fiber That means more fruit veggies whole grains and beans in your diet If you start eating these at every meal you should see an improvment in a few days to a werek If you just cant stomach those types of foods there are plenty of OTC supplements that are inexpensive and and work well for most people Ask your pharmacist to show you some examples If your problems last longer than a month or you notice black tar like stools see your doctor Youre most likely dehydrated Make sure you drink plenty of water Nothing with caffeine no coffee tea soda I have experienced this on several occasions Once is was related to new medication I began taking The next it was associated with stress and one other time it was the early symptoms of gallbladder stones Blood appearing in both places obviously relate to the digestion system The color of the blood is significant in each area My thoughts at first were the stomach but the doctors should have ruled out an ulcer Blood in the vomit   I think has to come from either the esophagus  or stomach Blood else where usually develops in the intestine Chrons disease has theses symptoms but as I mentioned earlier with the all the test I would think that if Chrons it would have been diagnosed Doctors need our help at times Maybe suggest possible ulcers in the stomach and or intestine Also mention Chrons as any other autoimmune disease I believe a simple blood test can rule out most However I hold no certified medical training Ive found that I have had to take control of my health by being informed and researching problems and therapies Several times it was me not my doctor that provided the knowledge to heal myself although I did need her to write the prescription Second and or third opinions are always appropriate actions when your doctor is or has not diagnosed your problem Your age is needed to appropriately feelout a possible diagnose However my best guess is that you are experiencing symptoms from two or more problems The neck and left arm pain could be a bulging disc at the C7 vertebraewhich I too have recently experienced Chiropractor adjustments with following massages successfully relieved the numbness and pain in my arm the neck pain still exist but could be related to the arthritiswhich has developed from my injuries Be careful to to seek treatment asap because without treatment the spine normally worsens If you experience extreme pain nausea can develop but diarrhea is not related Diarrhea could possibly come from a case of irritable bowel syndrome IBS or polyps in the colon Change of diet will drastically improve your symptoms Hot flashes normally result from the loss of the hormone estrogen It begins to depreciate in the body during menopause With your heart racing vomiting and fear Im reminded of anxiety or panic attacks Deep breathing meditation will improve anxiety And problems with vision could be related to the spine blood pressure or the need for glasses because of age If you are middle age see a doctor but get use to these type problems for your body is beginning its shut down process Worrying does not help it is only making things worse for you Get the sleep your body needs and make sure your water intake is appropriate Sleep is very important as is water Try to keep your spine in the natural position while sleeping Seek out free clinics state or government help someone that you know may have the answer for you Believe for yourself healing and it will come A1c levels will spike out after illness and during illness they will be low I had same signs your having I still have my gallbladder still The pain and Bowel problems were sometimes embarible then I had a colonoscopy and the specialist found out that I had Hpyloria Bacteria and actually had sores in my stomach and small intestine ducts so he put me on Nexium and the acid reflux is way better the stomach pains better and my food is digesting now it wouldnt digest just sit in my stomach for days and rot and thats were the stomach pain and bowel problems came in hope this helps ya out God Bless Have your doctor go over your previous last test and blood work my doctor said most doctors dont know or think to look for the HPyloria disease until brought to the attention Best of Luck and prayers for ya Go and see your physician This could be multople things such as a bowel obstruction ulcerative colitis or irritable bowel syndrome Better to always be safe than sorry What you are describing kind of sounds like irritable bowel syndrome It is easily affected by what you eat hence the mucous in the stool after eating certain foods My recommendation would be to stop eating the foods that cause the symptoms That way you arent damaging your body and not making yourself sick A lot of foods that cause symptoms with IBS are foods that are greasy cheesy or sugary Hope this helps httppmahoneybuythistodayinfo Maybe you should take a pregnancy test anyway maybe spotting Also might depend on your age assuming you are young maybe you are pregnant If you are older say menopause age maybe you periods are slowing down Just a couple of thoughts Good luck As a clarification could find another way I did not take all these drugs together In different occasions when I had fever usually caused by viral throat infection I tried them one by one each one more than once to make sure that its the cause of diarrhea So my question is  is there any alternative which could possibly not cause diarrhea  or is there anything which I can take with them to avoid diarrhea It can be very serious and gastroenteritis lasting more than a week really should be assessed by a physician Most food poisoning will resolve in a HEALTHY adult within a week If you go more than that you run the risk of throwing off electrolytes your body minerals salt potassium magnesium and so on You can suffer some cardiac events without the proper balance of minerals If you have bloody diarrhea this should always be assessed by physician Blood in vomit could indicate an ulcer bowel movement with coffee grind look indicates digested bloodulcer or intestinal bleed yes wether he is diabetic or not kind of sounds like vge I also have the same problem and I have insurance and still deal with the same thing have seen many docs and they dont give me no answers on how to stop it a along with this problem I have been gaining weight even if I only drink water it goes right through me nothing I do seems to work I have even cut down to eating 1 meal a day my husband worriers about me so for him I do eat but very small portions but does not matter how much or how little I eat or drink it still goes right through me please let me know if you find a solution to our problem all I get from the doctors is what they call a dumping serfdom Yes those symptoms may not be coincidental However you might need to wait a little longer to see if you are HIV positive Test results may be incorrect if youre tested too soon They have a test where they prick your finger just like a diabetes test Its completely painless and it takes 15 minutes They test for HIV antibodies and thats why you might need to wait a little longer to test If you have an outreach center near you they offer tests for free Also was the rash white Thats a common thing for HIV Flu symptoms are a common indicator Its certainly possible The best way is to see if that person you had an interaction with 100 is infected Bring himher to a test center Even if its negative heshe could still be a carrier Its scary but you can definitely get it under control If you feel extremely off and in danger visit the ER just in case its something else Why have you not gone to the doctor It could literally be anything From HIV to a dangerous flu or disease It could be IBS because it is know to cause a wide range of symptoms flatulence belching pain diarrhea constipation mucus in stool etc A person with IBS can have symptoms that change and bouts where they have lots of digestive troubles then it fixes itself After a few months another bout fixes itself etc how do I treat occasional diarrhea in my dog It sounds like you got food poisoning You were probably up all night vomiting and having diarrhea It usually goes away within 2448 hours Not quite sure myself Not an expert but that sounds pretty serious i would see your Doc "}
