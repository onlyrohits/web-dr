{"text": "the baby might have whooping cough get herhim checked out for whooping cough it might also be just bad allergies maybe asthma  I think so because when I have used Clorox in the past to clean my bathroom when I finished I would have the smell of the clorox in my nose and lungs It depends on how long you have had the symptoms sometimes if i feel a UTI coming on I start drinking more water and 100 no sugar added cranberry juice and it helps me Please read my post before responding As stated in my post I have been to the doctor In fact I have been to two doctors I was referred to a urologist but the urologist is not available until the end of January The two doctors I have seen do not think it is anything to be concerned about however I am still bleeding rather heavily I am hoping someone will be able to give me some advice about what the possible causes might be or what I should ask to be checked for when I see my doctor again 10 i dont beleave there is a narcotic pain pill that wont supress ur cough what it sounds like he is saying is that yes you have an infection BUT its hard to tell right away if its viral or bacterial Your doctor chose to try and treat a bacterial infection by giving you antibiotics Unfortunately for you it seems like it is viral which means you may not have needed antibiotics in the first place They wont hurt you to have had them but they didnt really help anything either Viral infections just take longer to get rid of  I just got over a really nasty viral infection myself Takes a while but hang in there Youre probably not even sick anymore  Based on my personal experience the person having such complaints faces frequent urination due to the blockage made by the stone and is never satisfied The urinary bladder fills again  again in intervals due to stone blockage Usually when they order labs with long term drug use as the reason it is because youre on a medication that has possible side effects  theyre checking for those which they should do For example patients on Amiodarone have their liver function checked annually They arent saying youre using recreationalillegal drugs A thick white vaginal discharge without a smell is normal Hormonal levels affect the amount and color of your vaginal discharge Since birth control pills contain hormones it is natural that they will affect your vaginal discharge Some birth control pills contain higher levels of estrogen and some are progesterone only without estrogen If the discharge is bothersome it may be advisable to change to a different type of birth control The concern with your discharge is that it smells This could be a sign of an infection You should see your gynecologist about your discharge and discuss whether it is a sign of infection and whether another birth control pill would be better for you The estrogen in birth control pills lowers the acidity of secretions in your vagina and increases your risk of yeast infections A vaginal yeast infection usually causes a sore itchy vagina with a thick clumpy white discharge that has no odor and looks a little like cottage cheese As long as a vaginal discharge is not associated with pain itching discoloration or a bad odor it can be a positive effect A vaginal discharge helps lubricate the vagina for intercourse In women who are not on birth control vaginal discharge can indicate whether or not ovulation is occurring During ovulation women have an abundant clear wet and stretchy discharge Many women compare the discharge at ovulation to raw egg whites To feel like you are dying at age 18 is very concerning You should definitely consult your family physician and possibly see a specialist Persistent symptoms after Lyme disease has been treated appropriately with antibiotics is a very controversial area We do know that longterm antibiotics do not help and are associated with serious complications We also know from recent studies that Lyme disease does not relapse but you can get reinfected The most common symptom of Lyme disease is a classical rash erythema migrans and patients who get this rash again have another infection not a relapse A small percentage of patients who are treated for Lyme disease 1020 develop persistent symptoms which may last for 6 months or more This syndrome is called Posttreatment Lyme Disease Syndrome PTLDS According to the most recent advice from the Centers for Disease Control CDC there are many fraudulent products claiming to treat chronic Lyme disease So be cautious and make sure you are not being treated by quacks Treatment by a physician associated with a University teaching hospital would be a good choice In addition to seeing your physician and making sure there is no other condition responsible for your symptoms the CDC recommends that you eat a healthy diet and get plenty of rest talk to a counselor and keep a diary of your activities and symptoms How long pleurisy lasts depends on the cause Pleurisy occurs when there is inflammation in the lining surrounding your lungs The lining consists of two thin sheets pleura When something causes these sheets to become inflamed it can feel as though two pieces of sand paper are rubbing together and sharp pain occurs on both inhaling and exhaling Infections from a virus or bacterium including tuberculosis a blood clot pulmonary embolism trauma cancer collagen vascular diseases such as lupus or unknown idiopathic are common causes of pleurisy Since your doctor has prescribed antibiotics and steroids your diagnosis is probably an infection Once the infection has healed the pleurisy should improve Sometimes scar tissue develops in the pleura and chronic pain can result Talk to your doctor about your continued pain If you have a cough or are a smoker this may be aggravating your problem Pain medications and cough suppressants may be helpful Thank you SueBee14 I do take daily probiotics and a multivitamin To clarify I am generally a relatively healthy individual I have never been sick like this before though I have had bronchitis in the past I am not a smoker and I live a healthy active lifestyle What makes this a particularly unique time in antibiotic resistance is that the pace of development of resistance is really outstripping the development of new drugs In the past we knew there were new drugs coming on the market  every year we had something new Now weve reached a situation where thats not the case year to year For some germs that we see a resistance to in hospitals theres nothing coming anytime soon Were facing a situation now where people are talking about the unavailability of antibiotics to treat common infections Infections became more difficult to treat we have to use agents that are more toxic and more expensive and we have to use them longer The scariest situation is one were seeing in hospitals in America where patients are acquiring infections and there are no antibiotic options We have a disease that should be treatable and we now encounter situations where they are not treatable In some cases its taking us back to the preantibiotic period In inpatient health care settings the one most common is staph staphylococcus bacteria resistance Staph causes bloodstream infections in patients with catheters From a public health perspective the definition of judicious is ensuring the antibiotic is used in the right circumstance is being used at the right dose and is given for the right duration Broadly thats how we would define the most judicious use of antibiotics Have the doctor do a blood check for herpes I have the same symptoms I feel its closer to the bronchitis side of things because of the clear mucus I cough when I am not riding I am able to comfortably take my heart rate over 160 but I still have a cough which lasts for weeks after an upper respiratory tract infection generally also involving the sinuses I also get the odd drainage from my sinuses afterduring a hot shower for example which seems to clear them My daughter had this when she was four years old My doc Told me that all it is a strep troat with a rash Yes you do need meds Strep is not fun with kidshope this helps Im not sure about the neurololgists you were seeing but my mother is being treated by a combination of neurologist psychiatrist  pain management She does see an endocrinologist because she had thyroid cancer which was removed but she has developed Graves Disease and suffers from Glaucoma and sees an Opthamologist Sounds like many but is not a high price to pay to find a way to successfully treat her without the use of narcotics It is wonderful to see her be able to return to a near normal way of living her life Not a doc but strep usually presents with red swollen lymphs and while spots Have no idea what your daughter has but would take her to doc post haste  does she have any other symptoms  fever blurred vision redness or yellowing skin other enlarged lymph nodes in the body etc  if thats the case child should probably go immediately to emergency room No  but is a class 1V controlled drug that has been removed from the market in some

the groin The presence of lymph nodes throughout the body is a normal anatomical feature for both men and women The physiological function of inguinal lymph nodes is to filter lymphatic material that channels to the groin areas the feet the legs and the genitals During periods of infection the lymph nodes can be overburdened doing the work of cleaning the body of debris and become enlarged usually the lymph nodes are about the size of an eraser head Due to the location of an enlarged inguinal lymph node I knew someone with one the size of a golf ball the swelling can be uncomfortable reddened and sometimes painful Due to the body attempting to fightoff an infection the patient may have a fever and not feel well Yes any bodily infection including jock itch and yeast infections can cause the lymph nodes to enlarge somewhat But there are other possible causes including a cyst may be benign infections of the legs feet and groin areas sexually transmitted diseases cancer rarely and allergic reactions If the lymph node has not returned to its normal eraser head size within the 7 day period following the start of antibiotic treatment I would suggest that you follow back with the doctor for further evaluation Sometimes a 2nd round of antibiotics is needed or a different antibiotic may be required Occasionally the lymph node is biopsied to ruleout cancer andor to determine the best antibiotic to treat the enlarged lymph node I hope that this answer has been helpful and that you feel better soon  Yes it certainly sounds like an allergic reaction Augmentin is derived from the Penicillin family Penicillin is a notorious cause of allergic reactions and dermatologic reactions in particular And yes the negative reactions can last for several days I had a similar experience and was given an injection of hydrocortisone to relief my discomfort When completing medical paperwork in the future it is advisable to report an apparent allergy to Augmentin A one time taking of clarithromycin 500 mg Biaxin 500 mg in a double dose 1000 mg is unlikely to produce any negative consequences Although unintended overdosing on this medication would be an exceptional event it should be noted that symptoms of ingesting too much are usually of the GI variety The signs of overdose may include diarrhea stomach pain nausea and vomiting There are many web sites offering to sell cheap generic anti biotic medication without any prescription These are typically companies located in foreign countries and do not require prescriptions except for controlled substances Purchasing medications in this manner is dangerous for many reasons including 1 Not knowing the source of these meds and their production quality control methods 2 It is most likely illegal for you to purchase medication in this manner It is possible that you could get into legal trouble 3 Anti biotic medications needs to be tailored to an exact disease strain and may not work on your condition 4 All medications may have side effects and can interact with other medications that you are prescribed A professional doctor familiar with you should determine your ability to safely take these medications My advice on purchasing these generic antibiotic medications online is to stay clear Gardening is not a new treatment option in the mental health field I worked in a large state mental hospital during

conditions One of the treatments is to thoroughly acidify the affected area  Once more acid is achieved by adjusting the pH level in your finger area the fungi will not be able to survive Here are a couple of old time soaks that may help Additional suggestions and thoughts Apply Thyme Oil  Thuja Oil  Together these oils have proven effective in treating stubborn fungal infections Follow the oil applications with 1 of the above referenced soak treatments Many treatments concentrate too much on actively trying to kill the fungus rather than changing the environmental conditions In my opinion the best approach to successfully treatment your finger may involve both lowering the pH and actively killing any fungus Please dont let the word ACID deter your soak treatment Boric acid has been used safely for many decades and it is even used to treat some eye aliments  Oldtime treatments may seem unorthodox and even primitive But over time they were routinely used by our ancestors and have a track record of providing safe and effective remedy You should be able to purchase all of recommended ingredients over the counter  from your local pharmacy large mart store andor vitaminhealth store at a reasonable price Continue to followup with your doctor to monitor your healing progress  It is the antibiotic and usually not yogurt that causes those GI disturbances Some yogurts contain beneficial bacteria Beneficial bacteria in yogurt may be listed on the package with such names as Acidophilus Thermophilus  Streptococcus Bifidus Bulgaricus or Lactobacillus  These bacteria may actually help to reduce the negative GI symptoms from the antibiotic Look for those ingredients on your yogurt container even when not taking an antibiotic to ensure that you receive positive probiotic bacteria Many of the leading brands of yogurts contain these beneficial bacteria If necessary ask your grocery store dairy manager or the pharmacist for assistance in selecting a yogurt with positive bacteria  To answer your question directly I would not take more than the maximum daily recommended dose of any product containing acetaminophen for more than several days Acetaminophen

potential career choices and the educationaltraining requirements as follows Best wishes for your success The prognosis must be considered as guarded Your concern about antibiotics losing their effectiveness is well grounded Germs will eventually become resistive to antibiotic treatment Besides age many clinicians score survival of pneumonia based upon its severity the particular pneumonia strain the overall medical condition of the patient and if any other underlying medical conditions exists The Center For Disease Control reports that 10  25 of all aged patients that require hospitalization with pneumonia do not survive For elderly patients with multiple illnesses the picture is even more bleak In the USA flu and pneumonia diseases are the 5th leading causes of death in the elderly population For greater than 50 of all patients admitted to the hospital for other reasons and who later contract pneumonia they will not survive the combination of the multiple conditions Of course patients such as your family member also get well on a regular basis  Talk with the patients doctors for a prognosis based upon the individuals unique set of circumstances I wish you the patient and the family well during these times of medical uncertainty  Absolute Neutrophil Count is a measurement of the percentage of the total White Blood Cells that are devoted to fighting infection Normal values may vary from testing lab to testing lab but should fit into an approximate range of 75  105 The result of 123 is above range by roughly 175  This value may indicate body stress or an active infection being fought off by the neutrophils Most of the results that you reported are on the high end of the normal range For example your husbands Ast value of 63 is more than double the high end range of 27 and can sometimes indicate a liver disturbance Of course please do not worry  sometimes we just need an immediate answer that could make some sense I am not a doctor and am not familiar with your husbands medical history My answer represents a good faith effort to be helpful and is by no means a definitive conclusion with guarantees of accuracy The serum blood results could also mean that something else entirely is afoul or have little overall significance All of the testing must be looked at collectively by a medical professional and in conjunction with a physical exam of the patient in order to arrive with an accurate diagnosis I suggest that your husband followup with his doctor for additional testing and possible referrals to other medical specialists Completing the antibiotic treatment may also prove to be helpful I hope that his health soon improves and wish you well  Was has changed are the views of the DEATramadols classification as

course and get back to my regular schedule after that For your any dental problem plz click here  confidentdentalcare  For your any dental problem click here  confidentdentalcare Deciding to exercise while youre sick can depend a lot on your illness and your symptoms To be honest the answer to your question often depends on who youre asking since there really doesnt seem to be a clear consensus or agreement I personally feel more often than not that its best to take time to rest and recover from your illness before continuing with exercise My rationale comes from a physiological standpoint Basically exercise can put a lot of stress on your body and your immune system is the only way that your body fights infections and pathogens that make you sick When you exercise youre devoting some of your bodys resources towards recovery from exercise instead of recovery from illness In some instances exercise may even make you sicker or even prolong your illness You also have to consider how comfortable you would feel while exercising with some of your various symptoms Medication may help alleviate some symptoms but otherwise how would you feel trying to go for a run if youre congested or have a persistent cough If you choose to exercise while sick you should consider decreasing your exercise intensity frequency or duration until you fully recover Please be considerate by following proper gym etiquette if you choose to work out in a gym Check out this WebMD article for more input and guidance httpwwwwebmdcomcoldandflufeaturesexercisingwhensick   Carrasyn Hydrogel is about the best I have found for years I used Silva Sorb which did little or nothing After months of antibiotics the wound continued until it became MRSA aka Folliculitis I feel it has become worse with lumps in the back of my neck The Hospital gave me the topical Mupirocin I will keep you informed There are mixed feelings on this medicine but from what I have heard it is not good to use since MS effects the nerves  There is a possibility of an exacerbation so I am NOT taking it  My short answer to your question is this Id suggest you continue going to the doctor but Id go to a different doctor Many conditions can take a long time to diagnose Sometimes you have to visit many doctors over the course of years to obtain a diagnosis So no you should not give up If youve been seeing a general medicine doctor like a primary care provider try finding an internal medicine specialist instead Take a copy of your medical records with you and keep a written log of your symptoms on a daily basis This data can help reveal patterns in your symptoms that help lead to a diagnosis I wish you all the best as you persevere in discovering whats causing you to feel so ill all the time I can hear the frustration in your question Its always annoying when we do what were told and our medical problem still doesnt clear up Unfortunately only your doctor can tell you whats going on I can tell you that some infections require more than one course of antibiotics to treat Or they require a very specific antibiotic Because your physician knows your medical history he or she can look into this further to determine what the best course of action is Im sorry youre going through this All of us in medicine sometimes wish we had a magic wand in order to cure peoples conditions immediately As of right now were still waiting Hang in there This is a very good question To my knowledge there is no serious adverse reaction associated with taking famotidine with an antibiotic However taking famotidine with an antifungal oral medication such as the ones with names ending in azole can have serious side effects Taking certain antacid or antiGERD medications like famotidine can reduce the effectiveness of other medications when taken together Thus its a good idea to wait 12 hours before or after taking other medications before you take a product like famotidine Because you have finished your antibiotics good for you the real question is Do you still have symptoms of your illness If not then you did no harm by combining the two medications If you still feel ill then Id suggest you go back to your primary care provider explain the situation and get evaluated to see if you need another course of antibiotics In all likelihood everything worked out fine At least thats my hope for you Im sorry to hear your husbands going through this It sure doesnt sound like much fun Obviously Im not a dentist so my experience with dental issues is somewhat limited I do think it would be odd not to treat a bona fide which is an infection with antibiotics but maybe this is a legitimate dental protocol I really dont know for sure If I were in your shoes I would take my husbands temperature every four hours with a thermometer none of this handtotheforehead stuff or you look feverish Get a good thermometer and take his temperature If hes running a fever its time for a trip to urgent care Fever often is a sign of infection For the bleeding one thing your husband can try is biting down firmly but not real real hard on a damp teabag or damp gauze for about 5 minutes Then gently remove it and see if the major bleeding has stopped If not try with a fresh tea bag A clot should form in the socket where the tooth was removed If this doesnt happen a painful condition called   can occur Extracting a wisdom tooth can be very painful If the dentist did not prescribe a pain reliever your husbands in a tough spot If hes been taking ibuprofen Motrin or aspirin this could be why hes still bleeding He could take acetaminophen Tylenol if hes not allergic to it This might help control the pain In any case if you have serious concerns about the situation either call the dentist or go to urgent care Wishing you well Im sorry to hear youre dealing with this As a plastic and reconstructive surgery nurse Ive worked with many hidradenitis patients so I understand how painful and embarrassing it can be Im afraid in general I dont have good news for you is a difficult insidious disease It basically is an infection of the apocrine sweat glands and only occurs where these glands are located in the skin the armpits groin perineal area perianal area and areola area around the nipple Hidradenitis in not curable In general patients go through mild outbreaks that are treated with antibiotics or other therapies In my experience hidradenitis almost always recurs however The only permanent solution to the problem is surgery Surgery is usually reserved for intractable cases where the lesions wont heal and stay open and oozing for weeks or even months Im not sure what your doctor is planning to inject you with Botox botulinum toxin is not indicated for hidradenitis and theres no evidence it would be useful Botox is used to treat excessive sweating which is called  Its possible your doctor is planning to inject corticosteroids into the lesions because this is a fairly common treatment when the disease is in the milder stage In general hidradenitis patients should focus on keeping the apocrine gland areas very clean with gentle daily washing using an antibacterial cleanser and cleansing only with bare fingers Its helpful to avoid any sort of skin trauma in susceptible areas and even washing with a washcloth can possibly trigger an outbreak I wish you all the best with this condition Medication mixups happen all the time Sometimes they can be serious In your case luckily no so much Putting a single dose of antibiotic drops in your healthy ear should have no adverse effects on the ear at all You should not continue treating that ear however Just use the drops as directed on the infected ear and all should be well Also do not try to rinse out or otherwise clean the antibiotic drops out of your healthy ear Theres no reason to do this and you could wind up causing an infection or perforating your ear drum Hope this sets your mind at ease Take care Im sorry to hear youre going through this Your symptoms definitely deserve to be checked out by your health care provider Any time a person develops a symptom like widespread loss of sensation to a body area its a good idea to get examined You can start with your primary care provider or whoever treated your UTIs Because your UTI cleared up over a month ago I wouldnt think your symptom is some weird side effect of antibiotics And I dont think antiperspirant use would cause loss of sensation either though if youre spraying it directly on your groin area you could try stopping that to see if sensation improves At any rate Id recommend you make an appointment with your health care provider for an exam Best wishes to you Im sorry to hear youre going through this How awful Youre right that certain antibiotics can cause an imbalance of good flora in the intestines and allow a bacterium called C diff to take over You should get checked out for this by your health care provider because if you do have C diff you need to be treated for it Clostridium difficile is highly contagious To avoid transmitting it to other people make sure you wash your hands frequently and thoroughly with warm soapy water Antibacterial hand rubs do not work against C diff The chest pain symptom may or may not be related to the antibiotic therapy Several conditions can cause the chest pain symptom you describe In women a condition called can cause the symptoms you describe Costochondroitis is basically an inflammation of the cartilage between the ribs and breastbone However because all of your symptoms occurred after the antibiotic usage you should report these side effects to your health care provider as soon as possible He or she will be able to thoroughly evaluate your symptoms and develop an appropriate treatment plan Best wishes Im glad you brought up a urinary tract infection UTI because that is the first thing that jumped into my mind Its possible for UTIs to occur again and again For that reason alone it would be worth taking your father back to his primary health care provider for an exam This will also give you an opportunity to discuss your other concerns with a medical professional Not eating can be a sign of some underlying condition that requires treatment or hospice care depending on your fathers wishes Its not unusual for elderly people to gradually lose their sense of balance or to experience degenerative spinal problems that lead to weakness in the legs arms etc Regardless of the cause of your fathers balance problems he may need to consider using an assistive device such as a walker on days when his balance isnt so good Wishing you all the best Sorry youre dealing with this I definitely would have these new symptoms checked out There may be some causeeffect between the strep and the swollen painful joints or you may have developed something else entirely At any rate the sudden onset of the symptoms you describe in an otherwise healthy young female is reason enough to seek medical care right away Your best bet is to return to the urgent care facility where you received the strep test and injection because theyll have your medical records at hand Normally I wouldnt advise someone who believes they have strep throat to seek urgent care Its something that can be handled by a primary care provider Take care and best wishes Sorry to hear youre going through this No fun Assuming youre not allergic to ibuprofen Advil and youre not taking any other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents naproxyn aspirin prescription pain relievers with NSAIDs in them you should be AOK to take some ibuprofen for the pain If you have any questions about this though feel free to ask your pharmacist first Dont forget to take ALL of your antibiotics Dont be that person who gets to the final two pills and decides its too much of a hassle to finish the bottle Dont do it Take them all Its important Feel better soon Im sorry to hear youre going through this Id be worried too Its not possible to tell from the information you provided if your eye doctor believes the raw sore on your eye is due to the dry eyeball rubbing on the eyelid in other words sort of like a rug burn or is caused by something else entirely Usually small that is a spot on the surface of the eyball that has been scratched or rubbed heal up within a couple of days Because yours has not I would suggest going back to the doctor for some followup care Corneal abrasions by themselves dont usually cause blindness I would suggest you ask your doctor what the potential outcomes are for your particular situation He or she is in the best position to tell you what to expect I hope you feel better soon In the United States narcotics are classified by the Drug Enforcement Administration DEA into different schedules based on several criteria Schedule I substances are defined as drugs with no known medical application and a high potential for abuse Schedule I substances include narcotics like cocaine and heroin Interestingly however marijuana also is classified as a Schedule I substance It remains to be seen if this will change as some states have voted to legalize marijuana and claim it has medicinal properties Schedule II substances include narcotics that are deemed to have therapeutic benefits yet maintain a high potential for abuse These include morphine fentanyl and even mixed amphetamine salts the brand name Adderall So basically the difference between Schedule I substances and Schedule II is simply in whether or not a drug is deemed to have a valid medical application Hope that clears things up for you Oh ouch Im sorry youve experienced a  Im not sure how long ago you finished your antibiotics but they do continue working for some time after you stop So if its only been a day or so Id wait and see what happens A pilonidal cyst can be painful even if its not infected Usually doctors do not prescribe antibiotics for these cysts Instead they need to be drained in order to heal The best advice is this If youre concerned about the cyst you should go back and see your doctor again Only he or she can examine the area to determine if the cyst has healed or if it needs further treatment Hope this helps The short answer is No Different antibiotics treat different types of bacterial infections For example penicillin is considered a broad spectrum antibiotic because it kills a wide array of bacteria Your health care provider probably prescribed two different types of antibiotics for your diverticulitis because he or she suspects there may be different types of bacteria involved in the infection By giving you two different antibiotics your provider is trying to make sure all the possible different bacteria are killed So please take both the antibiotics you were prescribed Take them exactly as prescribed on the label and  Do not stop taking the pills just because you start to feel better This type of behavior can contribute to the development of antibioticresistant bacterial strains Hope this helps Im sorry to hear youre going through this Sinus pain can feel so miserable is an inflammation swelling of the tissue that lines the This swelling of the tissue can cause the cavities to fill with fluid which causes pressure and pain and sometimes an infection Sinusitis can be caused by allergies nasal polyps a deviated septum or even smoke in the environment I hope your doctor has examined you to see if you have  While polyps arent extremely common in 14 year olds theyre not unheard of If you have not been examined for polyps you might ask your parents to get you an appointment with an earnosethroat doctor for an exam Meanwhile there are some things you can try at home to relieve your symptoms including Using a vaporizer warm mist in your bedroom be sure to clean it regularly because these devices can sometimes grow mold Inhaling steam such as from a pan of hot not boiling water Warm compresses wash rag soaked in very warm water laid across the eyesbridge of the nose Saline nose drops available over the counter If there is a smoker in your household this could be a cause of your symptoms If possible spend as much time as you can in a smokefree environment Because pets and other allergies can make sinusitis symptoms worse try to keep your bedroom petfree and make sure to vacuum or mop and dust regularly I hope one or more of these tips brings you some relief No absolutely not In the first place ear mites in animals arent usually treated with oral antibiotics In the second place you shouldnt have any leftover antibiotics to give your dog Whenever you receive a prescription for antibiotics its crucial  If you stop taking the antibiotics before theyre all gone it may contribute to the rise of antibioticresistant germs like  Please dont ever try to save or conserve antibiotics for another illness You need to take them all But back to your dog Its impossible for a lay person to diagnose ear mites This diagnosis requires an examination by a veterinarian using a lighted scope and other diagnostic tests Please take your pet to a veterinarian if you believe he has a health problem I would say yes seek immediate medical attention Obviously its impossible to diagnose the situation in a forum like this but your daughter could be experiencing an allergic reaction This should be addressed as soon as possible I hope everything turns out OK Several different antibiotics in different classes are used to treat peptic ulcers caused by  The best one is the one that works for you Your health care provider will prescribe an antibiotic for you based on your complete medical history any medication allergies you have and so on Its not possible to state unequivocally in a forum like this which antibiotic should be used to treat because so many factors going into the process of choosing a particular medication Sorry I cant be more specific but I wish you all the best This is an interesting question A blood test is not how yeast infection is diagnosed Normally a vaginal swab is taken and tested Sometimes health care providers diagnose a yeast infection simply based on history recently took antibiotics with a verbal report of symptoms now I have a vaginal discharge with itching A urine test also would not detect a vaginal yeast infection Thus Id recommend you return to your health care provider for an examination Genital blisters are not a normal feature of a yeast infection but they can be a sign of a sexually transmitted disease You deserve to find out exactly whats going on down there Wishing you all the best Your story illustrates why its so important to give a complete medical history to your health care provider on each visit Im wondering if the person who prescribed the penicillin knew you had just gotten over a bout of  If so then I would assume its OK to take the penicillin If not then I would suggest you call the prescribing physician tell them about your bout with colitis and ask about the penicillin treatment In the case of  antibiotics usually are given to shorten the period of time during which youre contagious Antibiotics also helps prevent the spread of strep to other parts of the body There are many different strains of Streptococcus bacteria some of them are more dangerous than others As I said your best bet is to ask the prescribing physician about taking penicillin after recovering from a recent bout of colitis That way you will have a positive answer to your question Take care Good question I cant answer specifically because you didnt mention the name of the antibiotic youre taking However WebMDs website offers a search feature that allows you to look up drug names and view specific side effects In general its not uncommon for any antibiotic to cause abdominal pain Im not familiar with increased urination as a side effects of antibiotics but you have to bear in mind that everyones body responds differently to any given drug If youre concerned about these side effects I suggest you call your health care provider to report them I would not recommend stopping the antibiotics without being told to do so by your physician Take care In the US prescription drugs are categorized through the Controlled Substances Act which places drugs into classes or schedules according to the governments view of potential for abuse Schedule 1 drugs are also referred to as class 1 drugs Drugs that fall under schedule 1 classification are illicit or illegal drugs have no medicinal purpose or use have an increased potential for abuse and if the drug poses a safety issue Narcotics such as LSD Heroin and Cocaine are all Schedule 1 drugs and although two states Colorado and Washington have legalized it and other states allow use for medicinal purposes Marijuana is also still classified as a Schedule 1 drug Schedule 2 drugs have acceptable medical use and importance an increased potential for dependency abuse and severe addiction Schedule 2 includes opiates with high dose Codeine Opium Morphine OxyCodone and Fentanyl as well as Barbiturates and Methamphetamine Schedule 2 drugs also include the ADHD drug Adderall The primary difference between a Schedule 1 and a Schedule 2 drug is whether there is a valid medical purpose for the drug Hi get doctor to check if you have a perforated ear drum as this might be a possibility I would be likely to think it is the antibiotics Do you usually get a rash from running a temperature I think you should contact your doctor immediately before you take any more medicine Just my opinion Has he been screened for Pertussis Whooping Cough There are plenty of antibiotics that are safe for your cousin to take while pregnant that can help treat a urinary tract infection The doctor will take into consideration many factors such as the term of the pregnancy the type of infection the age and health of the patient possible harm to the fetus and prior experiences with using certain medications during pregnancy Without knowing the exact antibiotic and bacteria that is causing the infection I would not be able to give you an exact recommendation However in order to prevent harm to the fetus your cousin should be as forthcoming as possible about her pregnancy if it isnt her obgyn prescribing her the medicine ZPak or azithromycin does have common side effects of stomach upset and diarrhea Taking this medication with food may help with your upset stomach If your diarrhea becomes more intense it is important to stay hydrated by taking in fluids and replenishing your electrolytes The diarrhea should subside within a few days to a week after you have finished the medication If the side effects are unbearable talk to your health care provider about prescribing another antibiotic Just remember that all antibiotics can have an effect on the normal flora of your GI tract Helicobacter pylori H pylori is a bacterium that causes inflammation and ulcers in the stomach About 80 of patients with H pylori are asymptomatic meaning they do not feel any pain or symptoms Treatment is very important We must eradicate the bacteria and allow the ulcer to heal Typically treatment is a combination of two antibiotics and 12 stomach medications There are several different effective combinations for treating H pylori Depending on what your antibiotic allergy is we can find an alternative antibiotic that will safely and effectively eradicate the infection Work with your pharmacist for alternatives The mastic gum is not going to be as effective in eliminating the bacteria  Every antibiotic has different absorption characteristics Some antibiotics work better with or without food Some are better with a fatty substance such as milk However some may have a drug interaction with the calcium contained in dairy products In this case milk should not be drunk with the medication and the consumption of the two should be separated out by about two hours The best liquid to take medication with is water It is important to check with your local pharmacist at the time of picking up the antibiotic or any medication to see if there are any food restrictions with your prescriptions Currently there are no drug interactions found between Prilosec and Avelox However this does not mean that interactions cannot exist It is important to work with your pharmacist to see if there is any new information regarding these two products Avinza is the extended release formulation of morphine sulfate Due to the addictive properties associated with this medication it is classified as a narcotic or schedule II medication  The reaction to photosensitivity is similar to sunburn The medication makes you more susceptible to burning when exposed to UV rays There should not be any interference with your vision If there is you should consult your local pharmacist about the particular antibiotic that you are taking to see if there is a visionrelated side effect associated with the medication I would say yes My dad had a cyst on his bicep and had it cut open and drained It hurt him for a couple of days and it did have drainage If it still concerns you ask your doctor Monday when you see HimHer  I hope this helped you Sounds like checking to see how far back your drug use if any is But I thought that was with hair follicles they can go back for a certain time I am not sure if they now have a blood test to do that which they probably do The risk of pregnancy in using routine antibiotics and birth control pills BCPs is very low In fact antifungals eg ketoconazole or macrolide antibiotics eg erythromycin azythromycin Biaxin actually increased blood levels of estradiolnot decrease them Being late taking some BCPs can also increase the risk of pregnancy but the risk is not large unless you entirely miss for two to three days Unprotected sex on active pills does not increase risk unless you had just completely missed several days of active pills I would urge you to do a reliable pregnancy test For the most accurate answer you can do one test on the first day of your next pack  Yes a UTI can cause a person to act totally different It can cause confusionanger and personality changes It can show symptoms of someone seriously mentally ill and bizarre behavior It should clear up with proper medication but if not the individual should return to the physician The symptoms it causes are not permanent but will continue until the correct medication is used and treatment corrects the UTI She needs to be taken back her pediatrition When you mentioned the sinus infection you said a possible sinus infection I am assuming it was not established 100 that she did in fact have one and if she has taken two rounds of antibiotics and both were different antibiotics I would take her bak and insist they ck for flu RSV bronchitis etc My 4 yr old grandaughter had the same thing and when the admitting DR from the ER called her regular Dr to let them know he was doing an admission the first thing the pediatrician asked was if the Grandmother was there meaning me I am a nurse and they were just blowing my daughter off thinking she was overreacting due to being a first time Mom It takes abou 5 minutes to do a simple test for RSV about 10 to ck for the flu and they did none of that and she had to stay in the hospital about 10 days because they didnt bother to run the proper tests An antibiotic will not help the cough it is only for infection However the cough after an illness is usually the longest symptom you have and can last some time If it becomes worse or prolongs more than a month I would ask the MD Also perhaps they should give him something specific for the cough Coughing is always worse at night and if could mean a better nights rest for him if he can not cough so much at night Also often a cough is actually good for getting rid of the junk that is in his lungs so he needs to cough some of it up and out I wouldnt worry too much at this point I recently just got over Pneumonia myself and according to my discharge papers it says that if you develop neck pain or stiffness that you should contact your doctor immediately I had a little bit of both but I believe mine was from the bed rest I would call your doctor and ask what they think you should do Hope you feel better soon Ive always heard that antibiotics lessen the performance of oral birth control pills I actually know of people who have become pregnant from taking antibiotics with their oral birth control It sounds like Mono or Epstien Bar Virus They can cause each other thogh because I had both in Summer 2012 and I still got the swollen lympnodes If you get these from Mono they can last up to a yearnot suppose to but I do and to tell you the truth I think I am getting it again but a whole lot worse Mono can lead to Lymphoma same symptoms as Mono and I know that because my ex did and well I know I got Lymphoma or Mono again but anyways if you got Mono there is no treatment for it the only thing you can do is get a lot of rest and take some over the counter pain pills and you cannot do hardly any physical activity because when you have Mono your spleen gets swollen and if you fall you could rupture your spleen and the result for that is Hospital for a while Mononucleosis Symptoms Pain or discomfort Enlarged or swollen glands Fever Excessive sweating Night sweats Skin rash Sore throat Yellow skin Yellow eyes Decreased appetite Fatigue Headache Tenderness to touch Weakness generalized Swollen tonsils Tender glands Unable to blink or close eyelid Usually not You can just use soap and water and clean it really well put a band aid on it and you should be okay If you want to use something like Neosporin or a Triple Antibiotic ointment its okay it will help prevent it and maybe if your child is very active or plays in sports you may want to put a little bit on the bruise or cut that they have before they go out and play But other than that soap and water really does the trick Certain classes of antibiotics are safe And when you go visit your doctor they are fully aware of what classes you can be on If you have any questions though when you come and drop off your prescription make sure you talk to the pharmacist Will be able to double check that information for you if the doctor may have prescribed an antibiotic that maybe you are allergic to when he didnt realize that either Let us know because well be more than happy to call them inform them and possibly get the prescription changed to something else If you have a red line running from the burn on your hand past your wrist it could already be infected and I would advise that you see a health care provider as soon as possible You should not use Epsom salts for a burn or ice You can submerge the area in cool water I would also not advise putting any antibiotic ointments or dressings until a health care provider has evaluated it You should be OK You want to make sure that you keep your pets medication in a separate area from your medications including vitamins and overthecounter medications Also make sure you are familiar with what your pills look like before you swallow them Always better to be safe than sorry Minocycline is a medication that is typically used to treat skin conditions like acne Antibiotics should not be used to treat the common cold It will not have any benefit and due to the fact that we have been misusing antibiotics for things like the common cold we are running out of options for infections and very bad ones called superbugs Often laryngitis that is caused by a cold or flu virus will resolve within 2 weeks Its great that you quit smoking There are other several conditions that can cause laryngitis or hoarseness Vocal cord nodules vocal cord polyps acid reflux irritation from smoking or overuse of the vocal cords from yelling are some common causes One serious cause of persistent hoarseness is cancer You can ask your doctor about referring you to an otolayrngologist to get an examination of your vocal cords if your symptoms persist Im no Dr but I think you may need to have that rechecked Ive had numerous yeast and bacterial infections and none have ever scabbed It may be different since you had a staph infection but honestly that sounds like herpes If Im not mistaken the Mayo clinic studied this and said only one anti biotic has been shown to impact birth controls effectiveness at allIts Rifampin Out of an abundance of caution some doctors suggest using a second form of birth control for a month Antibiotic resistance is the ability of bacteria or other microbes to resist the effects of an antibiotic Antibiotic resistance occurs when bacteria change in some way that reduces or eliminates the effectiveness of drugs chemicals or other agents designed to cure or prevent infections The bacteria survive and continue to multiply causing more harm It depends on how much is being used and how often bacteria are exposed to the drug Its related to the volume of use and the ability of bacteria to change their coat of armor It can happen in months it can happen in weeks or even over a period of years It usually takes longer for resistance to become widespread but with an increase in travel we can transport bacteria within hours to another location Young children the elderly and immunocompromised persons are at the highest risk for infection but resistant infections are occurring among all patient age groups and populations When we look at surveillance data for certain infections like the type of Streptococcus that causes meningitis pneumonia and bloodstream infections the prevalence of resistant infections has increased over time Were seeing a rise in antibiotic resistance for all age groups and for a number of different bacteria Almost all of our antibiotics are becoming less effective with time Unfortunately this has prompted providers and patients to choose nonrecommended drugs that are perceived to be stronger I am very concerned about the increased use of broadspectrum antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones and azithromycin for infections that should be treated by amoxicillin or penicillin The number of new antibiotics in development is alarmingly low and its a matter of resources Antibiotics are taken for a shorter period of time and its more economical for drug companies to make drugs that are taken for a long time Were also promoting the concept of using these antibiotics judiciously so companies and researchers dont see the economic benefit Antibiotics are not used in volume like a cholesterol or diabetes medication The FDA is currently considering options to facilitate new antibiotic development Adverse drug events can range from minor stomach ailments like nausea and vomiting to more serious consequences that may be lifethreatening and require hospitalization In children antibiotics are the most common cause of emergency department visits for adverse drug events Using antibiotics responsibly is the best way to avoid an adverse drug event It falls on the health care provider to prescribe only when needed The health care provider does have to take many factors into consideration including the severity and duration of illness findings on physical exam and the most likely diagnosis If its an upper respiratory infection its not always obvious whether the illness is viral or bacterial but the vast majority of time its viral If the patient still wants an antibiotic the most important approach is for a health care provider is to validate the patients concerns The provider can then discuss why they dont need an antibiotic and tell them that just because they dont need an antibiotic doesnt mean they arent sick The provider can also suggest an overthecounter product or other medicine to treat symptoms Be informed when an antibiotic is needed Dont insist on getting an antibiotic when going to your health care provider If you have a nasty cold its important to drink plenty of fluids get plenty of rest and ask your doctor what to do to treat your symptoms Its very important for patients and health care providers to work as a team to develop alternatives when an antibiotic isnt needed Dont be afraid to ask questions of your health care provider Its reasonable to ask why an antibiotic wasnt prescribed Patients can also play a role by staying up to date on vaccines and taking care of themselves Hand washing can prevent the spread of infections PICS urlhttpimageshackusphotomyimages651100mediaimag0514jpgimghttpimageshackusaimg6515831100mediaimag0514thjpgurl

way for you to find out how much the surgery will cost is to first check with your insurer  Yes it can even after you have finished the prescription for antibiotics You should go ahead and see your dentist who can examine the area and evaluate whether an intervention is needed I would look at the sentence under the Answer  This Answer should not be considered Good medical advice and should not take the place of a LLMD doctors visit I added the words in brackets Personally I found the answer to this above very misleading Although she mentioned the controversy but she did not tell you about the overwhelming evidence against the CDCs view point on Chronic Lyme Disease You are not alone your are not the only one receiving answers such as this one as to why you are still sick You will see for yourself through the help of a Lyme Literate doctor that antibiotics can and will help improve your symptoms You will also begin to find that no doctor with a closed mind will be able to help you through this There is a group on Facebook called Lyme Disease Awareness go there and get the right information from 13k people just like yourself who have been denied long term treatment from doctors I was one of those people I had other doctors who said I was fine call these Lyme Literate doctors quacks That quack gave me my life back Go to the Columbia University Tick borne Diseases research Center website at the top there is a second opinion option in one of the menus click it and go see doctor Brian Fallon and get your answers there or at lymediseaseorg The loosing your voice could be

safe to take with cephalexin with calcium carbonate There are no drug interactions to be concerned about If you are trying to treat diarrhea caused by an antibiotic I suggest you talk to your pharmacist or pediatrician Childrens PeptoBismol does not treat diarrhea Before making any recommendations I would really need some additional information about your daughter and the medications she is using It is unlikely that a medication for impetigo or an eye drop medicine would interfere with any overthecounter fever reducers So it is likely to be fine I would suggest you ask your pharmacist to recommend a medication to reduce your daughters fever based on her age weight and the other medications shes taking No Mirena is not affected by antibiotics It depends on where in your cycle you are and what antibiotic you are taking Not all antibiotics affect birth control pills A general rule of thumb is to use an alternative method of birth control for the course of the antibiotic usage and for seven days after you stop But it really would depend on your individual situation You should talk to your gynecologist or pharmacist about what you should do To answer your question I would need to know which medications you take for heart failure and how severe your heart failure is Vicodin and other narcotic pain relievers can cause breathing difficulties if you take too much People with congestive heart failure who often already have breathing difficulties may be more prone to that side effect In reference to your question about specific drug interactions I would need a list of your medications to answer that question I suggest you talk to your pharmacist who has a list of all your current medications and can discuss the potential for drug interactions with you It depends on the antibiotic and whether or not the multivitamin contains minerals like calcium iron or magnesium Certain antibiotics like tetracyclines fluoroquinolones Cipro and Levaquin and Zithromax should be spaced apart from mineral supplements and antacids Call your pharmacist who can provide you with the correct advice for the specific antibiotic and multivitamin you are asking about They should not affect the efficacy of each other There are no significant interactions reported between these two medications except that when taking Bactrim you are more likely to experience high potassium levels which is a side effect of enalapril If you are concerned about drug interactions you should talk to your doctor or pharmacist who can help you sort through your concerns Usually no Alcohol doesnt reduce the effectiveness of most antibiotics However alcohol can worsen side effects caused by some antibiotics like dizziness or an upset stomach You should definitely avoid drinking alcohol while taking metronidazole Flagyl as this combination can cause severe nausea and vomiting There have been a few isolated reports of trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole Bactrim causing a similar reaction with alcohol However given the millions of doses of the drug taken yearly this reaction is probably rare The packaging insert for Bactrim has no warning against drinking alcohol while taking the drug Heavy daily alcohol use can impair the function of the liver which can reduce its ability to metabolize some antibiotics what other possible antibiotics are used for this Vaginal itching and burning can have several different causes Most common are yeast infections and bacterial infections Normal bacteria and yeast are both found in the vagina in a delicate balance Some things including antibiotics diabetes and pregnancy can upset the balance This allows the yeast cells to take over A yeast infection can result causing burning and itching There may also be a thick whitish discharge If you have any of these symptoms you should call your healthcare provider Here is a good article from WebMD on yeast infections httpwomenwebmdcomtcvaginalyeastinfectionstopicoverview This is very normal There are lots of nerves associated with the teeth and mouth so swelling and pain is to be expected Quit agitating itIt came from some type of medication with sodiumReduce your sodium intake gradually you

has your doctor given you a test for your appendix Good Luck Hi Just taken antibiotics for anything is not the way to go by doing this you body would be building up a resistance to antibiotics and when you really need the they would do no good unless your really pushed up the level of antibiotics which would do your body no good Many everyday ailments do not require antibiotics because the not a virus just good and simple medicines should do the job Take heed be sensible leave antibiotics to your doctor Good Luck Hi found you this nice piece of info from Dr Dhide The simple answer to that is yes many antibiotics do affect menstrual periods The mechanism of how that happens is mainly related to reducing the available estrogen hormone which can lead to a change in the cycle and make it irregular Details As you are aware in the first fourteen days of a 28 day menstrual cycle the follicle starts growing and the initial hormone production is mainly estrogen This starts making the lining of the endometrium thicker After ovulation estrogen is joined by progesterone from the corpus luteum making the endometrium denser and mature Estrogen is not only metabolized by the liver but also recirculated between the gut and the liver enterohepatic circulation Antibiotics can affect estrogen metabolism in two ways Most antibiotics are metabolized in the liver and their presence can affect the rate of metabolism of estrogen and progesterone This can change the supply of estrogen available in the blood and that can cause irregularity of the cycle Some antibiotics cause diarrhea like symptoms as they change the gut flora This causes excessive excretion of estrogen through the gut as there is less time for reabsorption of estrogen thus affecting the enterohepatic circulation This too reduces levels of estrogen in the blood Thus by changing the levels of estrogen in the blood the cycle will get disturbed because the pituitary gland secretes its hormones depending on the level of estrogen in the blood It is now getting the wrong information and wont act as expected Ovulation is dependent on the pituitary gland identifying that there is enough estrogen in the blood and all these delicate balances are scuppered on antibiotic treatment This way many antibiotics can cause irregular menstrual cycle The other point to note is you take antibiotics when you are not well But process itself can alter your bodys metabolic behavior and ability to maintain a steady level of the hormone One very practical point to note are antibiotics can affect the level of estrogen and progestin of the oral contraceptive pills This in turn can cause the OC pill to fail when antibiotics are used in the same time period Antiobiotics like Rifampicin Ampicillin and some Cephalosporins are particularly notorious for this Now being on antibiotics for 23 day solid is not good for you its just in case you need to be on antibiotics for something more serious they wont work Do hope this helps you Good Luck PS Look if your going to play around with sex and not to happy to get pregnant now would be the time to think about BC theres the BC PIll the ring the implant IUD or the cap or

when an infection is preventing sperm moving from the testes as normal NCCWCH 2013135 httpwwwbabycentrecouka1014378fertilitydrugsformenixzz2lJMK95pv And this is were I found this info Good Luck If this has been going on for over 3 months then it sounds like something more serious than a cold or sinus infection Could possibly be asthma bronchitis or something else I would go see an otolaryngologist and ask your doctors office to refer you to one they would recommend I would see a dermatologist instead of your regular MD Sounds like a skin disorder or infection and they may be able to prescribe you a topical cream that will help No Antibiotic use will not affect your menstrual cycle but it can interact with birth control pills making them not as affective You may want to consider using additional protection for 2 weeks following completion of your antibiotics and address any more concerns with your doctor Do not stop taking your antibiotics unless directed by you doctor Cliff is transmitted through feces As you are not infected and wash with soap and water your granddaughter will be fine Enjoy your visit Antibiotics are very hard on your stomach if taken without food Google The Chronic Sinusitis Cure on the web may take care of your problem over the long term It depends For adults ciprofloxacin is used most commonly Sometimes for those traveling to certain places in Southeast Asia where bacterial pathogens have increased resistance some doctors like to prescribe azithromycin In some cases where you feel that the traveler may likely be exposed to just the coliform pathogens such as E coli some prescribe rifaximin Of course antibiotics work only for bacterial causes of travelers diarrhea Know that even bacterial travelers diarrhea usually gets better without antibiotic treatment although rehydration is always advised and symptoms may take 3 to 5 days or more to subside without treatment For those with diarrhea due to parasitic infections there are agents that are specific for each type of infection However for Giardia infections tinidazole Tindamax is often prescribed and is very effective Actually for selftreatment in the field we dont really encourage travelers to touch base with a provider before starting treatment Many travelers will be in areas where providers may not be up to the standard of care that travelers are used to or may be in places where the medications they can obtain are not safe  there is a big market in counterfeit medications in some developing nations So we urge people to get the medications they may need  and some education on when and how to use them  from their provider before traveling Then they can selftreat as long as they have only a mild to moderate case of travelers diarrhea If your husband has a fever I am surprised that his blood work came back nominal I would expect to see evidence of inflammation or elevated white blood cell counts He might be dealing with a viral form of bronchitis I went through something similar earlier this summer I had a wet cough that got worse at night for over six weeks If something like this is the case for your husband then a longlasting bronchitis that isnt responding to antibiotics may need other treatment My family doctor prescribed a course of Prednizone to reduce the background of inflammation in my viral bronchitis and allow my system to throw off the bug itself Your husband may wish to talk with his physician about whether a similar approach is appropriate for him as an individual Note although I am well read on some areas of chronic pain literature I am not a physician Regards Red Lawhern PhD Have the urine recultured after you are off the ampicillin You may need to be examined to look for other possible causes to account for your continuing symptoms and definitely get examined if you are having any back kidney area pain They are both treated individually but basically after the course of antibiotics have been completed AND the person tests negative the infections are considered cleared Both diseases can be prevented of course with the use of condoms No Neomycin is unrelated to penicillin NOSwimming exposure to water or going outside is not going to make your sick There are no contraindications for spray tanning while on amoxicillin Tan away if you want I have to say that medications are not the same as milk They wont sour in most cases but beyond their expiration date they may lose some potency especially if they have not be stored properly Your Cipro may be okay but I would advise you to check with your pharmacist first Most sore throats are not Strep and unless your Strep throat was confirmed by a lab test we may not be sure that you even had it If you did it can come back I dont know what you took for treatment You may need to have a throat culture to determine the organism causing your symptoms but many will be viral I do not know your age but mono can cause a severe sore throat and mimic Strep so if this is a concern your medical provider should also test you for mono I always recommend that people use the antibiotic eye drop in both eyes from the beginning since it can definitely spread to the other eye An antibiotic eye drop would ONLY be effective for pink eye caused by a pathogen Many cases of pink eye are viral or even allergic so in this case the antibiotic would not likely help A conjunctivitis pink eye can spread even when you are on antibiotic eye drops That depends on the antibiotic an important fact that you failed to share A quick way to get an answer would be to call a pharmacistany pharmacy that is open today Give them the name of the antibiotic and they can immediately tell you If you call the pharmacy that filled the prescription they can even contact your doctors office for a refill should this be necessary An allergic reaction would typically itch and have hives but not always I have no way of really knowing if you had a Cefzil allergic reaction or not but you can have a skin test to be sure A person with 5th disease erythema infectiosum can have occasional relapses of the lacy rash on the lower arms and thighs as well as the characteristic slapped face appearance for weeks after the initial disease That would depend on your diagnosis the reason for the antibiotic and the TYPE of antibiotic you are taking Some can be taken with moderate alcohol and some cannot Since you did not tell me those two important facts the easy way to get this answer is to call and speak to the pharmacist that filled that prescription for you It is considered contagious until it is clinically improved or gone If the impetigo area can be covered it would not be considered contagious since transmission requires direct contact It can spread by indirect contact if the person with the impetigo touches or picks at this sore and then touches their unwashed hands to a surface Not knowing the age of the person with impetigo the location on the body the type of oral antibiotic or the extentseverity of the infection it would not be possible to know exactly when this person is no longer capable of spread this Staph or Strep infection to others Your vaginal bumps and sores are not related to your urinary tract infection Up to 50 of all women have have classic symptoms of a UTI do not have positive urine cultures In other words the burning on urination is caused by something else Many times a women can have a subtle vaginal infection that can cause UTI symptoms or in your case sores due to  Since I have no way to see these bumps to offer you a patientspecific answer you will need to see your medical provider  someone who can examine you and make the determination Yeast can most definitely irritate the urethra if you have a vaginal yeast infection Use a topical yeast cream and smear on this area as well this can even be mixed with some 1 hydrocortisone cream to help with the irritation It is not likely to travel UP your urethra but it can definitely irritate this delicate tissue That is a question that only your dentist can answer Waiting a year being toothless is not something that anyone would want to do I really have no idea if you can wait a yearsome medical and dental problems precede our insurance You couldnt wait a year with appendicitis so you may not be able to wait a year before you have the proper insurance Technically yesbut in theory hardly anyone does this I dont know what you are taking or what your doctor is treating so I cannot suggest an alternative dosage method Call the pharmacist that filled the medicine or the medical provider who prescribed it and ask for a better dosage schedule one that you will likely be more compliant Nothis antibiotic will not cause you to test positive for cocaine In the US the Centers for Disease Control has a catchup vaccination schedule httpwwwcdcgovvaccinesschedules but I am not sure if Canada has a similar resource I am a HUGE supporter of vaccines but realistically being vaccinated may not be protective against bronchitis which is usually viral Influenza and pneumonia vaccines may help him however I cant answer that since I do not know your diagnosis Your medical provider appears to have treated you for both influenza Did you have a rapid test to confirm it and some sort of bacterial infection requiring antibiotics I just do not know enough about your case to accurately comment on your state of contagiousness so I suggest that you call your medical providerthe person who is treating you There is nothing really urgent about treating acne but it needs to be medically managed If you truly have cystic acne it may need to have the services of a good dermatologist perhaps using Accutane The purpose of this site is to answer brief questions so I really cannot blindly treat you in the this forum with little or no information especially without being able to examin you I know it is frustrating for you but acne can be effectively controlled on the proper medical regimeIt may be time to take your treatment up a notch They are safe to take together and you are correctantibiotics may reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives so it would be wise to add another form of birth control until the antibiotic course has been completed Yes I have no way of knowing the accuracy of your diagnosis but Swimmers ear is usually not treated so aggressively Since I do not know what you are taking or if these prescriptions are appropriate your only recourse ios to be examined again I am not a big fan of using an emergency room for this problem but sometimes it is your only option Dont drive on painkillerslet someone else take you That would be up to the discretion of your treating medical provider but basically antibiotics are not needed  even contraindicated  if you have mono a viral infection Assuming you do not have any concurrent bacterial component the antibiotic would not likely be needed I know of no antibiotic that would cause arm soreness There is most likely another reason for those symptoms Yes Exercise is not contraindicated when you are under antibiotic treatment for a sinus infection Assuming that you feel well and exercise is not exacerbating any of your symptoms you can exercise Children of those ages can certainly have mood changes but it is not the result of antibiotics Yes you can take vaccines while on an antibiotic for a dental problem Oral antibiotics including cephalexin will NOT clear up pink eye conjunctivitis If the cause is suspected to be bacterial a prescription antibiotic eye ointment or drops are used  Some causes of conjunctivitis would include allergy or viruses and do not require any antibiotics Give it a rest It should heal spontaneously in a few days Keep using the antibiotic ointment Naprosyn is NOT a narcotic It is a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medication just like Aleve similar to ibuprofen It may be time to see an ENT  Ear Nose and Throat  specialist someone who has the skill and equipment to peer up that clogged nostril of yours to see if you have a physical obstruction like a deviated septum or polyp If not a trial of nasal corticosteroid sprays by prescription only may be something for your doctor to try Not all sinus infections as a matter of fact very few are due to bacterial infections so this could be another reason why the two course of antibiotics didnt seem to help The ENT can also check your sinuses The plugged feeling may have nothing to do with the infection at this point but related to a Eustachian tube that is not regulating middle ear pressure It is not possible to predict how long this might last since every person is different when it comes to healing Eustachian tube dysfunction can last daysor months so hopefully yours will improve soon Pink eye conjunctivitis can be cause be allergy viruses bacteria and chemical irritants Only the bacterial type needs antibiotic eye drops The rest may clear up without the drops Conjunctivitis is never treated with pills unless it is assumed to be allergy in which cases antihistamines may be recommended Oral Clindaymycin is not used to treat pinkeye You should NOT be selfprescribing leftover antibiotics Stay on those antibiotics and keep using the Nasonex Hot or warm facial compresses 20 minutes at a time can help as well as staying very well hydrated No one really wants sinus surgery but sometimes that is the only or last resort Hang in there your doctor is doing the best that he can to avoid the operating room by keeping on you an extended course of antibiotics You need to call the ENT and ask for patientspecific advice Typically I use the vinegar solution as a PREVENTATIVE rather than a treatment The Cirprodex should be doing the job assuming this is a bacterial infection and not fungal You can try active probiotics or probiotic drinks but sometimes if you are particularly prone to vaginal yeast infections you will still get them Some antibiotics are more notorious for causing them than others Make sure that your medical provider has a standing order for yeast medication if or when you go get vaginitis Oral Diflucan prescription only is nice and much less messy than vaginal creams or suppositories You most definitely should get another urine test culture If the lab tests are negative you may not need another course of antibiotics but other causes for your symptom array should be medicallyexplored by your doctor Before considering alternative therapies whatever you were planning it is best to be properly diagnosed Yes if the pneumonia is caused by a bacterial infection and the proper antibiotic is prescribed Noit would not be very likely if you are consistently on Depo Provera The antibiotic is unlikely to negate the contraceptive effect but in the future consider using condoms until you are no longer on the antibiotic Not a narcotic It will not show up on a test to check drugs of abuse I have no way of blindly diagnosing the reason or significance of your cough over the Internet so I would suggest that you see a medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated Your drowning sensation may be due to fluid or mucous in your lower respiratory tract or even pneumonia so it would be wise to get it checked out today Yes you can start the medicine today The alcohol has left the building Damaged fingernails will usually grow back unless the matrix cells at the base of the nail has been damaged No this would not be an underlying factor An allergic reaction to neomycin is actually quite common I see this on occasion with neomycincontaining eardrops Your doctor needs to prescribe something else for you as well as treat the allergic response One more consideration since you have had this problem for a MONTH is that the cause may not be bacterial You could easily have a FUNGAL infection in your ear canal requiring an entirely different treatment There is really little that I can do blindly over the Internet since I have no way of examining your skin eruption A visual exam is essential to make an accurate diagnosis Failure to improve on your current treatment may indicated that the diagnosis was incorrect or the treatment was not appropriate Your only course of action is to be examined again or see a dermatologist for a higherlevel diagnostic opinion Unless the particular antibiotic has to be taken at time when your stomach is empty you can take it anytime that you will consistently remember it You will need to ask your mothers doctor or the hospital since I do not know what KIND of pneumonia she has As you know I have no way of seeing your throat taking a more detailed medical history or examining you over the Internet I can make a blind guess but a guess is NOT the same as a diagnostic opinion  one that can only be accomplished by seeing a medical professional or ENT specialist You may want to look up tonsilliths tonsil stones These are common accumulations of food and other debris that can get trapped in or around the tonsillar areas Again dont diagnose yourselfsee a medical professional for these matters The same dangers as when medical providers prescribe antibiotics for viral infections Clearly if an antibiotic is NOT needed it should not be used Not all cultures are accurate so if there are strong clinical signs of an infection MRSA or not the clinician may elect to treat clinically and not on laboratory findings Fever is the bodys response to inflammation or infection Amoxicillin is only effective for a BACTERIAL infection like Strep It is absolutely no effect on viruses A person can contract a virus anytime even while taking an antibiotic Fever doesnt really shock or bother medical professionals as much as it does parents but I cannot blindly tell you the significance of this brief transient fever I do not know anything about your son what you really mean by a spike so when in doubt call his medical provider  someone who knows him his particular case and someone that can offer you the patientspecific advice that you really need I dont knowyou will need to ask the doctor who gave you the injection There are MANY different kinds of injectable antibiotics so it would not be prudent for me to just guess I suspect it may be Rocephin but you will need to call and confirm this Side effects of Rocephin are nil except that shots still hurt Yesthat would be one of the more logical possibilities to account for large reactive cervical lymph nodes I am glad you are seeing an ENT Antibiotics are WORTHLESS for colds Colds are caused by viruses and no virus responds to an antibiotic Period I am assuming you had a MIDDLE EAR infection there are different typesnot a common problem for a 40 year old but happens nonetheless Fluid can be from a few different sources Middle ear infections can sometimes cause the eardrum to breakrupture Small ruptures could create a leak and large ruptures can cause a flood of fluid usually accompanied by blood Fluid can also be caused by water in the ear canal perhaps trapped behind a little wax dam When you lie down more heat is created in the ear canal and these little dams can break causing this trapped water to come out on your pillow or show in your outer ear It can be yellow waxstained or clear Qtip users tend to create a lot of these wax dams Neither one of these conditions is considered serious even a tiny rupture Most will heal in a few weeks You can see your medical provider to be properly examined and to make sure the infection has resolved Many times the source of this fluid may not be obvious since the dam may have broken and the eardrum may have healed Assuming you are not having ear pain or signs of infection you could wait it out a bit longeror see your doctor Since you are six weeks after your infection it may be best to be examined There can be several reasons Since I cant examine your ear or even know the underlying reason you are using the Ciprodex there are several different types of ear infections it is difficult for me to blindly determine a reason One reason could be ear canal swelling In otitis externa the ear canal can nearly swell shut Some clinicians will insert a wick in the ear canal to allow those drops to penetrate Other reason is a wax impaction or a canal filled with pus or other debris Many clinicians will not attempt to clean out the ear when it is painful so if you have a blockage of debris those drops will NOT go in I would suggest that you consult the clinician currently treating you since they examined you last If the pain is worse on your antibiotics then you need to consult your treating medical provider today You may need a change in your antibiotic therapy based on your urine culture hopefully this was done a stronger antibiotic or further evaluation of your kidney pain Perhaps you have a kidney stone Your medical provider may order a kidney ultrasound Unfortunately I do not know the details of your particular case to address your question Generally bronchitis is VIRAL and does not require any antibiotics Most viruses are contagious a day before you are ill and two to three days afterwards Apparently your medical provider felt you needed an antibiotic perhaps you had signs of a bacterial secondary component so it would be wise to get patientspecific recommendations directly from the provider who is currently treating you  a person that knows your clinical findings knows your medical history knows what antibiotic and dosage you are taking and why and finally someone that can weigh this information against the type of immunocompromised state of this person There are many different types of STD infections Some become evident quite soon like gonorrhea but some can have more subtle symptoms like Chlamydia  Some can have longer incubation periods like syphilis HPV or even herpes Unless you specifically test for these organisms you dont know if your one STD I dont know what you had did not have an accompanying STD  perhaps one that was not specifically tested And some STDs can only be tested when you actually have them You mentioned a UTI Although UTIs can be related to sexual activity not all UTIs are considered STDs Since I do not know your culture report the type of organism that caused your UTI it is difficult to offer you any patientspecific advice You may need to talk to your medical provider and get some additional details Using a condom 100 of the time is clearly part the answer to prevent future infections Selecting the right partner is important too Any partner who does not agree with using condoms is one that you should avoid Telling a future partner is you decision It may be the right thing to do and may give your partner another reason to use a condom There is a good chance that your partner has had prior partners and may have an STD past to share with you Sex can be risky I hope that you never have to repeat this stressful experience again Yes itching can be the first sign of an allergic reactionto an antibiotic or perhaps something else you have eaten touched or inhaled Even if you have been on this antibiotic before without problems a person can develop adverse reactions including allergic reactions You need to contact your medical provider immediately for patientspecific advice which may include stopping and changing the antibiotic you are taken and prescribing something like an antihistamine to counteract a possible allergic response Antihistamines assuming you can take this sort of drug are used to stop the itching It is very difficult for me to comment on your case since I do not know any of the details including the reason for the antibitoics in the first place Not all swollen glands are bacterial so if you a a viral infection they would not help no matter what antibiotic you chose If you are getting worse it is up to your doctor to run some additional diagnostic test I think this would be better than just throwing another a 4th antibiotic at it without really knowing if the underlying reason justifies it This could indicate a bacterial vaginal infection so treatment with an oral antibiotic or a prescription vaginal cream would be indicated Assuming you are talking about a MIDDLE ear infection you should have experienced relief in three daysIF a you were properly and accurately diagnosed b your ear infection was due to a bacteria and not a virus and c the antibiotic you are taking was the proper choice and dosage Failure to respond to your treatment is a reason to call your medical provider for patientspecific advice Since you are still having dizziness and head pressure it would be wise to be reexamined She should be tested for mono Ask your medical provider to order an EBV panel  a very sensitive mono test Cold sores are viral herpes simplex Most people who get them when the are ill is because of a reactivation of this virus that has been lying dormant Cold sores are not caused by an antibiotic like Ceftin or others I have been seeing kids for over 40 years and I cannot recall one incident where a child fainted from pink eye or even an ear infection As a matter of fact it is pretty rare for a six year old to faint PERIOD so yes I think your little girl deserves a thorough examination to find a reasonI just cant buy the pink eyeear infection theory Sorry Like you I am a bit skeptical I dont know anything about your little girl or have the ability to examine her so I dont really have any wild guesses as to why she fainted or if this was a seizure but I do feel she deserves a workup I would suggest a pediatric neurologist An MD prescribes medications as part of their practice a psychologist does not Both are skilled and licensed to provide psychotherapy While it is possible to have both there are combined PhD and MD programs you may want to choose a discipline that best suits your career goals To be a physician you are looking at four years of college four years of medical school followed by three or four years of a psychiatry residency After you complete your residency and take your specialty board exams you can design your practice anyway that you likeyou can prescribe medications if the patient needs them AND provide the psychotherapy I have no idea with KIND of blood work your doctor has ordered You do have a right to know so you will need to ask your doctor or the lab The code you have listed is a diagnosis code  not a type of blood test Strep is not a virus it is a bacteria antibiotics do not work for viruses About 24 hours after taking antibiotics your level of contagiousness is considerably diminished so it is safe for children to return to school and for adults to return to their normal activitieswork assuming you feel up to it There are no germs that just cause pneumonia but many pathogens viruses bacteria etc can result in pneumonia While the disease is not contagious the germs that cause it may be but exposure does not necessarily mean the exposed person will get pneumoniathey may just get a cold or nothing at all Influenza is definitely contagious and influenza can result in pneumonia in some people There are only a few things that can be done for middle ear effusion fluid 1 You can wait it out but after three months you need to see an ENT 2 Decongestants nasal corticosteroids etc have all been used with limited success Sometimes it helpssometimes it doesnt Antibiotics are not usually helpful since this is more of plumbing and ventilation issuenot an infection 3 An ENT may need to surgical drain the fluid tympanostomy or suction and place tubes in your ears I cant answer that question since I dont know your symptoms have the ability to examine you or see those test results I can tell you that about half of the women I am also assuming you are a female who have symptoms of a UTI do not have them Many will have urethral irritation usually from sexual activity or even a vaginal infection The culture is much more accurate than the rapid urine test so follow your instructions and see your medical provider again if you are not getting better Dont panic There are several other choices depending on what your medical provider is treating at the time Antibiotics are specifically prescribed for a certain bacterial infection I wish that I could address your question but without the ability to see your infection firsthand I would only be making a blind guess not something that medical providers like to do My suggestion to you is to call your medical provider  someone who has seen this infection and is treating you  for patient specific advice This infection is being treated and managed appropriately so I cannot imagine that you will not get better You should not be able to get Strep while on amoxicillin since this drug is used for Strep You can however get a VIRAL sore throat or even mono while taking antibiotics Swimming in a lake is fine A written prescription or the actual drug I see nothing wrong with a doctor mailing a written prescription some require a special triplicate form to a legitimate pain patient that may not be able to make it to the office for medical reasons Obviously the use of any addicting medication should be carefully monitored If the actual drug was mailed then I would be worried Doctors dont do this If you are gaining weight then eat LESS of that healthy food and exercise more Your body will eventually drop the extra weight if you keep up your new healthy habits There are no magic solutions other than this By stopping cigarettes you have given your bodyyour ONLY bodyand your family the best gift ever  Assuming the cause of your eye infection was bacterial the use of antibiotic drops should limit your contagiousness in about 24 hours  Taking some precautions after this time like handwashing is still recommended I dont know how your doctors are treating you now medications but if you feel you are not being managed aggressive enough you can always choose to see a different gastroenterologist Doctors are really like chefsthey all cook a bit differently Obviously without the ability to see these blisters firsthand I cannot offer you a patientspecific answer but many people who see blisterlike growths on the pharynx throat are really seeing ectopic lymph tissue often referred to as cobblestones in the medical world this area is rich in lymph tissue Cobblestoning can be found in a variety of medical conditions  basically anything that causes inflammation Allergies even if no allergies were identified and recurrent viral infections irriation from postnasal drainage etc all can cause these cobblestonelike effects Unless a bacterial infections is diagnosed by a culture or rapid Strep test antibiotics especially massive antibitoics tend to have no curative effects Blisters filled with pus would not be common for cobblestones If she also gets bronchitis at the same time it may not be related to this throat finding at all Most cases of bronchitis are viral Although a specific reason has not be determined by her medical providers it would be wise to keep looking Yesthis is often prescribed No this is a medication that helps expand the lungs used for asthma It is NOT a narcotic You are asking for very patientspecific advice Since I do not know the medical details of your case it would be impossible to blindly give you the okay to go swimminggo to schoolworkor even make a determination if you are contagious I dont know the location or extent of your cellulitis the type of bacteria that was cultured or even the name and dosage of your antibiotic The only person that can give you this okay would be the medical provider who is treating you I am sorry Noamoxicillin will not interfere with a drug screening test You will not catch Chlamydia that wayso relax You and your girlfriend are safe and your roomate is under treatment There is nothing wrong with spraying a little Lysol on those contaminated surfaces like toilet seats though Most sore throats are viral and do not require antibiotics at all The only sore throats that need treated are the ones that are Strep proven by a lab test A persistent sore throat can be due to allergy mononucleosis postnasal drainage from a sinus infection or just from congestion where you are mouthbreathing Since I cannot examine you over the Internet you will need to consult or see your medical provider again for another examinationlooking for other causes Cefdinir should be out of your system in a day or sorelatively fast but that does not mean your diarrhea assuming it was caused by this antibiotic will immediately stop Acne is often treated with oral antibiotics since a certain skin bacteria is responsible for those big red whiteheadsthe ones that people like to squeeze and pop and the ones that can lead to scarring Take the antibiotic and I think you will see that it helps You need to have you leg examined first  not something that can be done over the Internet If you do need treatment like an antibiotic this would need to be prescribed by a medical provider  other thing that cannot be done on line There are several antibiotics that are not on your list The selection of an appropriate antibiotic takes you allergies into consideration as well as the diagnosis and severity of the illness We consider allergies to cover entire classes For instance when are allergic to Augmentin we assume you may be allergic to all penicillins in this class When you are allergic to doxycycline you are considered allergic to the tetracycline class There is not an antibiotic called clydomyacine so you may be referring to clindamycin It is best to keep an accurate list of your allergies A few antibiotics that are not on your list would include sufla drugs and erythromycin  macrolide class drugs Another would be the fluoroquinalone class antibiotics There are more There are no set rulesevery person every UTI every treatment regime etc is uniquely different It is even possible that your lowback pain is unrelated to your UTI Since I do not know anything about you your medical history details of your UTI it would not be possible to specifically comment about your particular case My advice would be for you to contact your medical provider  the person who is currently treating you and familiar with your case Since you are still having symptoms it is likely you will need to be reexamined and perhaps have some additional diagnostic tests to make sure your UTI has indeed resolved A person under treatment for Strep can still have a sore throat for several more days but they are not considered contagious about a day after starting an appropriate antibitoic regime The real purpose of the antibiotic is to prevent more serious albeit rare Strep complications not so much for just treating the throat I will never understand that rationale of giving antibiotics to anyone that has a VIRAL infection This is not good medicine Most cases of tonillitis are viral and antibiotics are absolutely worthless and sometimes even harmful With that said First I assume you are a healthy adult Most adults have relatively good immune systems that fight off viral and bacterial exposures 247 While the organisms may be capable of causing disease the organism has to find a susceptible host Most of the time we just fight off those alien bugs If you dont have tonsils you cant get tonsillitis but you can get a viral infection but it does not mean it will be identical to your son who has a different immune system You may just get a stuffy nose or nothing at all In your case you did get an upper respiratory infection but it didnt have to come from your son It could have been someone else and an entired different bug There are over 200 respiratory viruses capable of causing colds I get exposed to Strep a dozen times a week and have never got it thanks to my own immune system and perhaps better handwashing and other precautions Trust your immune system In most cases you will be just fine The cold that you most likely have now will likely improve in a few days on its own Those medications are chemically compatible to be taken at the same time assuming you currently have clinical indications to take BOTH It is never a good idea to selfprescribe an antibiotic left over from a previous infection Unfortunately I do not know the age of your daughter to know if it is safe There are two types of cough medication expectorants that MAKE you cough and suppressants that quiet a cough I suspect that you would want a nighttime suppressant Medications containing dextromethoraphan are considered the most effective overthecounter suppressants as long as they are not in combination with decongestants and expectorants Honey is a good cough suppressant too No side effects and the kids love it Remember that a cough is there for a reason  to clear the airway of mucous and keep it out of the lungs It is okay to suppress a cough temporarily at night so a child can rest but leave it alone during the day I dont know the dosage or medical reason you were prescribed corticosteroids but I can say they are safeand very effective in treating inflammation Most people do not get high when they take them but it they can interfere with sleep if taken near bedtime If you are reluctant to comply with your doctors recommendations it would be wise to discuss it with himher In most casesand with most antibiotics you will be fine Your Implanon  Nexplanon will not become less effective Here is a little piece I found for you from Planned Parenthood httpppgoorghealthservicesfamilyplanningorlandoflbirthcontrolimplanon A tetanus shot should still be administered She wont need another until she is 93 I would not agree that properly washed underwear would likely retain any fungus residuals Fungus can exist just about everywhere in the home  especially in warm dark or moist areas Finding the one source or sources may be difficult Have you seen a dermatologist If not this would be recommended I am sure that it is not a good idea Your lungs are having a difficult time as it is recovering from your pneumonia so why make things worse with cigar smoke You may not feel that you are inhaling but enough smoke is getting into your respiratory tract to cause an inflammatory response increase mucous production and trigger a new round of coughing I am sorry that you are stuck in your house and are bored but smoking a cigar when you have pneumonia is not wisenot wise at all Nothis sleeping pill is not a narcotic Yeast can occur on ANY skin or mucous membrane surfaces like the mouth in the groin between the toes or under breasts Men can get yeast infections A vagina is not a requirement Are you sure you do not have a vagina If you had a hysterectomy only the uterus and ovaries were removed Woman are left with a vagina The urine should be cultured to determine the pathogen causing the infection and the best antibiotic for that particular pathogen Not all people with classic symptoms of the UTI actually have one so perhaps you will need to see a urologist to look for other possibilities Unless your doctor actually did a test rapid strep test or culture to CONFIRM that you have Strep the diagnosis could be incorrect You may have a viral infection or even Mono Obviously since I cant examine you I have no way of making that important diagnostic call Most viral infections improve on day four even if you do nothing so if you are not improving you need to see your medical provider again Ask to see a urologist It is not normal to have three KIDNEY infections in three months You need a more thorough diagnostic workup and kidney stones can cause infections Assuming that his diagnosis was correctand as long as he is comfortable and feeling better on his medications pleurisy should not be a big problem I am a little concerned that the doctor gave an antibitoic since pleurisy is usually viral not bacterial I also assume that you are going with him and there are medical facilities near the location of your camping If I had pleurisy I would rather be in my own houseon my own bed Call the doctor again today I dont know which antibiotic or dosage she is on but if she is getting worse she may need a stronger doseor a different antibiotic Bronchitis is not contagious but the respiratory virus that most likely caused it can be Most clinicians do not use antibiotic to treat it unless it was felt there is a bacterial component or underlying respiratory condition that warrants it Exposure to this virus does not necessarily mean that you will get bronchitis You may just get a coldor nothing at all Respiratory viruses can have an incubation period as short as 1224 hours I dont know the details of your casewhy you have been on narcotics for a long timebut perhaps it is time for you to see a new pain specialist There are PLENTY of other effective antibiotics like erythromycin or the cephalosporins some penicillin allergic people may have a crossover allergy to this class however He needs to be under the care of a good dentist NOW Let the dentist determine the type of treatment and antibiotics If he has an abscess he needs more than just a prescription for a nonpenicillin based antibiotic Dental infections like you are describing need immediate and definitive care Both a sinus infection and a middle ear infection can cause dizziness While antibiotics do not typically cause dizziness you may find it listed among the lesscommon side effects Augmentin typically causes an upset stomach or diarrhea but not dizziness Keep in mind that there can be hundreds of other causes of dizziness so if your symptoms persist you will need to consult your medical provider A hysterectomy only removes the uterus Any woman of any age who still has a vagina can most definitely get a vaginal yeast infection especially after being on systemic antibiotics It is prudent to use the over the counter yeast medication that you have mentioned the antiitch medication would only treat the itch not the cause Obviously if you are not improving you will need to consult your medical provider for patientspecific advice I have used this antibiotic for 40 years and I have never had a person return with blue veins on the forehead This would not be a cephalexin drug reaction or side effect Zyrtec an antihistamine is compatible with antibiotics The only side effects you my experience would be to them individually A bright yellow nasal discharge does not automatically mean sinusitis or even indicate a bacterial infection Mucous can become yellow for a variety of reasons including simple stagnation Most sinus infections like colds are viral and do not require antibiotics The fact that you do not have a fever or other sinus related symptoms would seem to indicate that you may not have a sinusitis You can definitely wait it out a bit longer Viral infections tend to last about a week worse in the first 34 days Do all of the supportive measures drink plenty of water humidify your environment use saline nasal spray as well as the Pantanse and keep that stuffy nose following Should your symptoms persist or worsen it would be wise to seek medical care so that you can be properly examined and treated Sure Yeseither one has the potential of setting the stage for a yeast infection Hydroxyzine Atarax is not a nacrotic White strips are not a clinical sign of Strep so nothis is not typical If you had a confirming lab test rapid strep or culture then your diagnosis was most likely accurate and you will be feeling better soon assuming you are on the correct antibiotic If you were diagnosed clinically  just by a visual examination  then there is a 5050 chance that your diagnosis was incorrect and you do NOT have Strep but rather a viral infection Viruses do not respond at all to antibiotics and one virus in particular  the one that causes mono can actually become worse when you are taking antibiotics Yes shingles can definitely affect the eye This is called herpetic keratitis and can be quite serious if not diagnosed promptly and treated effectively Steroid eye drops can make herpes in the eye worse so this is usually not done unless specifically prescribed by an ophthalmologist Antibiotic eye drops would have no beneficial effect on herpes involving the eye so special antiviralantiherpetic drops are used Having chicken pox as a child is really a prerequisite to getting shingles in the eye or other places The chicken pox virus is also a herpes virus that has reactivated from a second exposure I am pleased that her eye cultures came back negative A child is not likely to die from a simple urinary tract infection In the unlikely event that the infection went to the kidneys and then caused septicemia a serious problem could emerge but she is fine nowon the right antibiotic so dont worry Good question The answer is maybe but why take even the remote chance Use a secondary form of birth control while you are taking antibiotics We do know that antibiotics may decrease the effectiveness of ORAL contraceptives and Nexplanon is just a different delivery system for the hormones used to prevent pregnancy You are wise to be careful Are you sure it is just a kidney infection and not a kidney STONE You may need a CT scan of your kidneys to be sure Keflex is an appropriate drug assuming the pathogen causing your infection has been identified and is sensitive to this drug Find out about your urine culture report IF you are still having severe pain you most definitely need to consult the medical provider who is treating you Maybe but ciprofloxin is not the typical treatment for Strep throat assuming that you even have it Not all adults who are exposed to Strep will get it You should consult the medical provider who examined youthe one who knows that TYPE of ear infection you have I am guessing a middle ear infection the severity and the type of antibiotics you are taking Not all middle ear infections will be problematic after a few days but since I do not know the details of your case you need to get patientspecific advice from someone who has examined youor have someone examine your ears just prior to your journey The terrible thing is that you may or may not need ANY antibiotics Most viral infections are viruses and do not require antibiotics A few are Strep but making a selfdiagnosis based solely on symptoms is not much better than a coin toss Some viral sore throats are mono mononucleosis I cant blindly diagnose you over the Internet and you may or may not have the skills to accurately diagnose yourself so my recommendation is for you to be TESTED for Strep at student healtha simple rapid test If you do have it then the amoxicillin may be appropriate assuming you have the proper doseyou didnt share that information for your weight and severity of infection Read my new Blog on on the new guidelines for treating ear infections in children Most children with middle ear problems improve by age six so you have two more years I dont know if he is a candidate for tubes or not but middle ear fluid lasting more than three months is very problematic He may need to see an ENT specialist at this point He is likely in preschool or preK where he is being exposed Keeping him home would reduce his exposure to other children with colds but the benefits of preschool outweigh this risk Never smoke around a child If he has allergies try and get them controlled Hopefully he is immunized against pneumococcal disease and influenza  the new treatment guidelines stress the vaccines as a preventative Yes Antibiotics will not interfere with an influenza test No link The response to treatment is very individualized Depending on the severity of the sinusitis the accuracy of the diagnosis the choicedosage of antibiotic and thepatients response to those antibiotics one could remain symptomatic for a week or more Since most sinus infections are viral the will eventually go away on their own The ones that require antibiotics may last a week or more In your own chlorinated pool Yes assuming the wound is not draining or oozing You can always cover small area of Staph with a waterproof bandaid but in most cases he will not contaminate a large pool or put others at risk These eye drops do not contain any amoxicillin so it is okay to use Incidentally these sulfabased eye drops tend to burnsting so be nice to him Orcall the doctor again I am not sure of the reason for the antibiotic if the Strep test was negative That usually indicates a virus and viruses including mono do not respond at all to any antibiotic The reason for the continue fever may also indicate that an antibiotic may have been unnecessary but of course I wasnt there and cant see his throat With that said if he is in pain not swallowing having another examination is prudent He could still have mono since some early tests are false negative and not as accurate Yesthat would be fine That varies There are no set rules Some of our electronic prescriptions have expiration dates Some pharmacists will not fill an older prescription if it is not medicallyappropriate Since I dont know what you are filling and how old the prescription is you will just have to try and fill it if it is appropriate that you do so at this time at the pharmacy Since I dont know how you were diagnosed lab culture rapid strep test or just a look and see by your medical provider penicillin remains the treatment of choice for treating TRUE labdiagnosed Group A beta hemolytic Strep also known as Strep Throat A Zpack is really not the appropriate dose for treating Strep and I dont know the dose you received of the penicillin I can say that failure of antibiotics often means that you a never had Strep but a viral sore throat  in which case no antibiotic would help b you were not treated appropriately either by dosage etc for a labdiagnosed case c you are a Strepcarrier this can be difficult to cure by oral antibiotics or d you have monomononucleosis that clinicallymimicked Strep throat  in this case you need to have a lab test called an EBV Panel to see if you have mono Either way you need to contact your medical provider  the only one that can order any additional lab tests andor treat you further I dont know what she is taking but there is a very common amoxicillin side effect that can produce a rash near the end of the antibiotic course of treatment Scarlet fever tends to be a generalized all over the body bright red sandpaperyrough skin rash that will eventually peel especially on the palms and feet A person would not typically get a scarlet fever eruption on day six using an antibiotic that could treat strep again I dont know what she is taking Was your daughter labdiagnosed with Strep rapid strep swab or a Strep culture or was it a clinical diagnosis the medical provider just examined her throat and said Strep Clinical diagnoses of Strep are no more accurate than a cointoss in most instances Since your sister is the one treating you with her unfinished medication perhaps this question should be directed to her I am never of fan of this practice I think it is dangerous Since many illnesses are viral antibiotiics do absolutely nothing Apparently the medical provider at Urgent Care did not feel that you needed any antibiotic let alone a Sulfa drug or azithromycin The fact that a Zpack has worked for you in the past in no way implies that each year you have the same identical bacterial infection that responds to azithromycin Statistically this would be highly unlikely Illnesses do change over time Most people get better on their own but a few do get worse If you feel you are now sicker than when you were evaluated by Urgent Care than it would be better to be reevaluated again Perhaps you do need an antibiotic now but there is no way for me to make that determination over the Internet This would be the right thing to do Taking someone elses leftover antibiotic is not UTIs are not transmittable Make sure that both of you are tested for Chlamydia Additionally not all burning on urination is due to a UTI There are many other causes so your boyfriend should see his medical provider and be properly examined and have his urine tested NOyou should not take ANYTHING especially an antibiotic when you are pregnant unless it was specifically prescribed for you for this condition by your OB doctor Besides I dont know that is cause of your cysts nor did you disclose what kind of antibiotic you want to use Let you doctor treat this problem There are no viruses or bacteria that only cause bronchitis Any of the hundreds of respiratory organisms can do Most cases nearly all of bronchitis in children I dont know your daughters age are viral and do not require antibiotics ear infections often do not require them either but antibiotics have remained the mainstay of treatment Ear infections are not contagious Respiratory viruses are considered most contagious a day before you get sick and for about two days afterwards Since it has been a week your daughter is not likely contagious even if she still has some residual symptoms like a cough I know some people use vinegar as a hair conditioner I havent heard of anyone reporting color change or hair loss though you could always try a patch test to see if it interacts with your hair in a particular way It is possible Heres information about the ailment httpwwwwebmdcomskinproblemsandtreatmentsrockymountainspottedfever httpwwwwebmdcomskinproblemsandtreatmentspictureofrockymountainspottedfever It really sounds like you were exposed to it in the past but your body developed antibodies to it and beat it Looking at thy sympoms it would seem that youd remember a full blown case A complex study published in May 2011 involved about 18000 women and 1330 episodes of contraceptive failure Researchers looked at the data on women both during months of contraceptive success ie not getting pregnant versus contraceptive failure to see if taking antibiotics made any difference The bottom line contraceptive failures did occur but it was no more likely to occur if a woman was taking oral antibiotics Warning it is well known that one particular antibiotic rifampin does definitely change the metabolism of many oral contraceptives The study excluded women on that medication because the interaction of rifampin and contraceptives is well established If youre taking rifampin you must use a second form of birth control Even the best largest studies cant say with 100 certainty that a superrare event cant occur It could be that in very rare cases antibiotics could somehow affect the way oral contraceptives work So if you want to be supersafe using two contraceptives is never a mistake Butorphanol is Stadol Basically its an analgesic Is it possible that I never even had an infection and therefore did not require antibiotics So its possible that something else is wrong then This could be from an infection in the belly button like an ear infection or of more concern it could be from a deeper infection such as from a cyst or residual tract leftover from when you were in your mothers uterus called a urachal cyst or remnant of the urachus You need to see a general surgeon On rare occasions and this is very rare there can even be a cancer in the tract You may need a CT scan to get this looked at yes rashes and itching at the very least loud music for 1 underlying seizure disorder or possibly another neurological defect or a simple ear infection Yes I suffer from chronic infections Find a good urologist He She can run tests and figure out what is going on They will come up with a treatment plan to fit your needs and determine the reason you are getting UTIs and how to best treat it Loss of voice can be caused due to many reason Injury swelling or disease such as Acid reflux such as heartburnThickening of the vocal chords Nodules or polyps on the vocal chords Muscle tension dysphonia Damage to the nerves that affect how the larynx function Bronchitis is also a reason which can result of exposure to airway irritants such as tobacco smoke household cleaning agents smog etc For more information on this you can visit PharmacySell To help with future coldsupper respiratory I would highly suggest start taking a Prebiotic and Probiotic DAILY Its helped me tremendously and there has been recent medical articles supporting this Adult acne may be due to a hormonal imbalance Your physician may be considering incorporating therapy in order to achieve an improved ratio of estrogen and testosterone in your body Oral antibiotics can be effective in treating persistent acne You also want to make sure that you are not using compounds that are adversely affecting the pH balance of your skin Please ask your prescribing doctor for specifics on the medications you are taking Many antibiotics do interfere with certain birth control methods and patients are counseled to use a backup birth control method while the antibiotics are in their system  Has your primary care provider suggested allergy testing I have a friend who would cough so hard that he passed out They did allergy screening found out he was allergic to molds pollens and dander and started him on allergy shots Have you had a repeat chest xray Are you running a fever When you cough are you bring up anything If so does it have color This information would be helpful for your primary care provider as well My other suggestion would be to ask for a pulmonologist referral I hope you get some relief soon Misusing an antibiotic can cause bacteria to develop a drugresistance making it harder to treat others effectively Basically if you misuse antibiotics you can cause many other people to not be able to be treated effectively endangering lives and potentially causing easily treatable diseases to become as hard to treat as AIDS Also it will throw off your immune system and cause the good bacteria in your body to stop working the way theyre supposed to For example women taking antibiotics are more likely to develop a yeast infection Basically dont take antibiotics unless you are prescribed If you do it would be counterproductive and possibly make you even more sick than you were before and making it harder to get rid of If you do not have the insurance to see a doctor try bugging the ER dont lie to them It would only make things harder go to your local Urgent Care or see if there are any clinics around that cater to those with a low income or no insurance possible infection of a tooth on that side or just simply your body actively fighting possible infection somewhere on that side how do you feel see any open soars tooth aches throat nose ear you should have finished them as your doctor advised you to Gargle with warm salt water and even gargle with hydrogen peroxide if the soars in your mouth do not show improvement I strongly suggest you seek medical attention to avoid further infection you most def already have and are battling right now The tongue is much like a sponge Whatever you eat or drink it Absorbs Are you a smoker Smoking often can have adverse effects on oral health leaving the tongue  hairy in texture and a yellowed colour Dark pops will also leave a yellowed colour to the tongue Make sure you are brushing the tongue when you brush the teeth to avoid the further growth of bacteria  There is a condition called yellow tongue which is usually self treatable Yellow tongue occurs when bacteria of the mouth grow and create a colour pigment of yellow It is suggested to quit smoking brush the tongue several times a day and use mouth wash and to create a high fibre diet for yourself If you are feeling really concerned you can wash mouth with 1 part peroxide 5 parts waterdo not swallow Once rinsed gargle water through the mouth for approximately 60 seconds to shake peroxide and bacteria loose It is recommended that you should continue to check eyes for yellowing as the next related cause could be jaundice If concerns continue go see your MD Good news The second day my period was much more normal and I as far as I know am not pregnant My boobs are still quite swollen so I am just going to enjoy that for now 48hrs is recommended  for adults in good health if fever is over 103 or greater ER would be suggested if ibuprofen is not reducing fever drink lots of fluids high temps can dehydrate you and that can cause fevers to yes if the DR subscribes it certain antibiotics are used on certain infections only if the first round of antibiotics failed to work on the infection another one is recommended for sureamox is usually a 10 day course but zythro is a 5 day course but remains in your system for 10 days and works great too I prefer zythro myself I have never had a problem with antibotics I was prescribed Amox TRK CLV 500  125 MG tablets Sando this was generic for Augmentin Took my first pill began to itch in my vagina area strange I must say then itching entire body I didnt connect the medication with the itch thought I had touched something in the yard soap or clothing causing problem Took baking soda bath showers anything I could find for allergy thinking it was from contacting something Still didnt connect with medication Next morning the same thing Called my doctor stopped medication flushed my body drinking lots and lots of water I dont think it was the actual medication I think it is something in the base product you know to hold the pill together If I should need Augmentin again I will asked for a different mfg too bad they are not in capsule form less foreign ingrets We never think of the fillers in tablets Look up everything that is in your medicationit is an eye opener Some doctors wont take your tonsils out as an adult but some will Most adults that had their tonsils removed as an adult were glad they did it It is definitely harder as you get older as kids are more resilient I would discuss with your doctor how your health issues factor into the surgery Consult an ent Good luck Antibiotics kill the good bacteria in your intestinal tract Try eating yogurt or taking asadopholis tablets Even if this doesnt help it cannot hurt you You would be surprised how much good can be gained by consuming the correct foods and suppliments when needed Good Luck I am taking FAS3 as my doctor has advised me to take it for yellowish white discharge About ovulation do you mean I have to try on 16 or 15 th day This is my 4th day with anitbiotics of a 10 day regimenits a slow process the back of my throat is slowly getting back to the regular pink color looked with a flashlight theres a couple of spots still redhavenr been able to eat much solid foodsjust a lot of liquids I had a friend with the same problem in High School Along with antibiotics his dermatologist recommended that he wash his face with a mild soap MANY times a day and moisturize with an acne friendly face lotion Maybe you can just call the clinic and ask them to refill the RX for antibiotics If youve been seen 2x before by the same physician they should have no problem refilling it over the phone for you How did the infection start Acne Bud bite If its acne start washing Hope this helps Take your Antibiotoics and be paitent That happens to me everytime I get a sinus infection Try also using breath right strips i found they helped relieved pressure during the night so I was able to taste somethings in the mornings Every 8 hours you need to go back to the doctor some of those could be symptoms of the birth control u are not taking it correctly or you could have something more seriously i d say you need a pelvic exam done go see a dr You can try visiting an acne treatment center They can give you a more expert advice for your acne You can also try their acne scar removal for you to have a better skin No it is common for dogs to eat grass I have 3 Dachshunds and they do it all the time They may be lacking something in there diet I would not be concerned The antibiotics should not effect your blood test They may show up in a blood test But should not effect what ever your Dr is looking for by ordering a blood test By getting the blood test your doctor may find something else And change the Cipro to another type of medication If you got an order from the Dr who gave you the antibiotic Cipro to have blood work done You should have it done There are several reasons First of all are you producing sputum If yes the anitbiotics dont work for you This can happen because of resistance and the only way of knowing is by doing a throat swab and culture If you have no sputum production You may either have some amount of postnasal drip  which gives an irritant cough This is treated using an over the counter cold med plus a decongesant The other possibility is that of a post infectious cough which can last upto 8 weeks if not treated with steroid nasal spray which requires a prescription Please see your doctor if you have cough for a total of 3 weeks When I was Pregnant my doctor told me no so I dont recommend it They told me to take Robetession DM or Tylenol Cold I experienced something similar with my baby girl and the only thing that worked was this over the counter stuff called Domeboro It came in little packets that you just mix with water and soak their tush in It was the ONLY thing that would work and it helped immediately I think you may be able to find it at Walgreens I need to know how long it will take for redness to go out of cellulitis Take her back to her allergist as soon as you can I dont know if her Dr prescribed the Zyrtec but there are other medicines that can control the other symptoms  And be sure to be following the advice of the allergist It may be something else triggering her allergies or asthma My daughter takes Nasonex along with Oceans nasal spray and Asmenex Twist Inhaler for breathing then also Loratidineand those seem to do the trick for her But shes never been given Zyrtec Hope this helps I have had many bladder infections in my life and one time i let one go and slacked on taking my meds my dr prescribed me and it ended up turing into a kindey infection Which cause horrible lower back pain and pains in my abdomen I would look into that you can never be too careful I had a dentist tell me after 5 years that I didnt need it anymore and I had some work done 75 years and I got infection in my knee replacement Now I am on antibiotics foverever I have been sick for three months started with a sinus infection to bronchitis and Asthma i still have mucous in the back of my throatI feel like this is going to be forever I have been to the doctors eight or nine times already They just keep telling me it takes time As long as they see me getting a little better each time Hope it doesnt last too much longer for you It could be your pancrease Acne rosacea is not always treated with the same medications used for acne vulgaris This is because acne rosacea has an unknown cause there a different triggers unlike acne vulgaris Weakness should be excepted in an 84 year old woman after having a bout with nausea It could have indeed been a virus or bug even though there was no vomitting The best thing to do is to consult a doctor Talk to your doctor it depends on what is being treated Some antibiotics are prescribed for specific things and they all have varying strengths the truth is taking the wrong antibiotic can make some matters worse which is why you should talk to your doctor i know when i had strep throat every thing burnes and i could not swallow at all water burned the worst to popsicles and pudding was the easiest on my throat the only way to know is to have your doctor look in your ear with an otoscope to see the drum also they may order a tympanogram which is a very simple and quick test done by an audiologist that checks the movement of the drum I dont know about your hands and feet but have your doctors checked your tonsils and adenoids If you still have them they might be causing your sore throat I had a similar problem last year My doctors thought I had strep and put me on antibiotics and then put me on allergy medication but when I went to a ear nose and throat specialist they said that my tonsils themselves were the problem and they had to remove them Sometimes general practitioners may not catch a problem like that so it may be necessary to go see a specialist who can more accurately diagnose your problem yes Some but not all best to get a veterinarian to prescribe the proper antibiotics if it is the same medication it may be cheaper at a local pharmacy some states will allow you to buy your animals medications that are the same as human meds at the pharmacy but they do not require the vet to give you that option by writing a script no see your primary doctor for an appointment I thought strep throat was very contagous for 48 hours without medication A Stye is an infection of a gland of an eyelid Usually this happens because the gland has been blocked The stye will almost look like a pimple and can point inwards towards the eye or outwards It can be sore and painful A good treatment for most styes are warm compresses This means taking a warm towel and pressing it on the eyelid with your eyes closed for 15 minutes at a time Do this four times a day Also stop wearing makeup since this can make the infection worse Most styes resolve within a few weeks Sometimes antibiotic eyedrops are given by doctors Also if the stye is not getting better within a few weeks an eye doctor may drain it If you are having additional redness around the eye are having fever or are concerned its best to speak to your doctor and have him evaluate it Only if it is Oked by your doctor this is something related to the nerve responsible for hearing and balance  u should see ur doctor he could prescribe some medications for you Whats at work when a persons ammonia levels are 2X what is normal Toxicity drug interaction seizure meds and antibiotic What is this Hi there I have PTSD too I started making jewelry handmade everything from scratch that started out with finding my primary material at the beach Walking on the beach then coming home to do something that I enjoy doing has a wonderful calming effect It keeps me from thinking about the very thing that caused the PTSD and Im creating things at the same time Would gardening help your PTSD I think so If it is something you love doing and it relaxes you Then I would give it a try If that doesnt work at least use the concept on something else Youll be surprised at the results Its helped me a lot God bless Ohone more thingthe best people to ask are those who HAVE PTSD Its one thing to be book smart but if youve never experienced it you really dont know  No offense A weird trick my dermatologist gave me when antibiotics failed was apple cider vinegar by applying it to acne twice a day for a couple minutes to get rid of old skin cells due to the acidic levels which replaces them with new healthier cells This personally has helped me a lot and as weird as it sounds eating nutritional foods was the other tip she told me so foods rich in vitamin a c and e help a lot but stay away from saturated and trans fats along with processed foods Also I found out on WebMD that 30100 mg of zinc a day will help decrease the oil produced by body Gives this a try as all are very inexpensive compared to the antibiotics and creams dermatologists prescribe I think you should see an ENT I suffered with sinus infections for many years with nosebleeds sinus pressure daily headaches facial pain congestion drainage etc I also tried anything you can buy OTC and prescriptions Last year I saw an ENT had a CT Scan and a few months later I had sinus surgery which included scrapingcleaning out my sinus cavities and correcting a deviatied septum Healing time was within what they consider a normal range and the pain was not as bad as I had expected it to be I had surgery in August and was allergy tested in December and recently began allergy shots It has been a long process but I am finally starting to feel better If you are going to see an ENT I would talk to friends family members people who can recommend one to you that they have seen and are happy with The practice I go to has a website entcarolinacom and they offer some helpful advice information on procedures testing etc i hope this helps good luck My advice to you is to consider the complications that could arise if you dont have the surgery This disease will not cure itself Some can control it but all it will take is one bad attack with an abscess andor perforation to ruin your whole day You have to weigh all risks and I would do this in consultation with a colorectal surgeon and not an internistbrother or not httpvitalhudklinikknokroppspleiekroppspeelinghtml httpwwwkolibrimedicalcomnohjem2uncategorisedhtml httpcosmedicanonsartiklerrenseprodukterhtmlThank you Its entirely possible to have multiple infections at the same time but your doctor is right antibiotics should clear any bacterial infections right up The sore throat is likely being caused by post nasal drip from your sinus infection If its strep you should see small white patches on your tonsils and its extremely painful If after you finish your round of antibiotics you still have a serious sore throat then you should go back to the doctor for more tests Good luck I had cellulitis of my right ear once in March and again in July 2013 had red ear  a sore on antitragus crease part on ear Was prescribed 250 mg oral suspension Cephalexin twice a day for 10 days Was going to be given Keflex but have trouble swallowing pills so doctors changed prescription to cephalexin no most antibiotics they give for strep are Ammoxicilian ammoxicilian clavulanateAugmentin brand name cephalexin or Keflex brand name never heard of the drug you are speaking of I know you dont have insurance but think of your health I recently thought I was having an ear infection so went to doctor but did not want to pay high medical bill so went to clinic inside Walgreens and turns out it was only a skin infection of the outer ear was given cephalexin for 10 days since I can only take liquid meds have troubles taking pills I have insurance and ended up only paying 20 for the visit and 5 for the meds You should try Take Care clinic at Walgreens or MinuteClinic at CVS their prices seem to be very reasonable without insurance my visit would have been only 89 It is possible for it to reoccur I had it in right ear also with a deep sore on antitragus march 2013 july 2013 and january 3 2014 All three times was prescribed cephalexin generic for keflex suspension 250 mg for 14 days May 16 2014 diagnosed with swimmers ear sore on antitragus also had a dry cough too Then May 27 went to walgreens clinic again for severe nasal congestion diagnosed as sinus infection Prescribed sulfamethtrimeth suspension generic for bactrim 250 mg for 10 days I agree with that answer If you have it available White Mountain Bulgarian Yogurt has those and no additives It also has 90 billion probiotics per one cup serving It will definitely make a person feel better Yes I feel that Gardening would help wPTSD because it is relaxing It could also help wcreativity I recommend it my mom had severe issues for three yrs with diverticulitis and every time she was hospitalized antibiotics was their only solution  Eventually they removed a large portion of her intestines which helped some but not completely until one day we took her to UCLA medical center and a doctor there told us about a dietary supplement you could find in some health stores or on line and since that time as long as she takes them she has no issues Then on occasion such as of lately my mom believes that she is wasting her money and that she no longer has issues with this anymore which is why after 2 12 yrs of good health i find myself on this site looking for answers about her diet while she suffers from diareara vomiting fever cramping and so forth This supplement is fairly inexpensive like you could even put a cost on what you go thru if you suffer from this and i swear that it actually saved her life because she also has high blood pressure n heart problems Even if you just have occasion issues i am certain you will thank god for this one kind doctor who was not just out to take peoples money Try it and pass the word on cause i have found this is much more common than you probably realize The name of this supplement is SACCHAROMYCES BOULARDII THAT IS THE CORRECT SPELLINGii at the end  If your symptoms are bad start with the highest dose and you can cut it back as you get better but i dont recommend stopping them completely By no means am I an expert but you need to get a second opinion because that is not normal i have had mrsa boils since november 2013 4 to be exact now i have another one do i still need to go to the doctor to get more antibiotics I think its an infection so you may need start giving her antibiotic cream fucidin but I highly recommend a visit to a dermatologist to ensure that Your situation has probably cleared up by now but I still had to respond because I had the exact same problem a few years ago I was in the exact same situation I was taking antibiotics nose spray oral steroids and everything else the doctor could prescribe One day I read about something called a Nedi Pot and decided to try it Nothing else worked so I figured why not There are a few different types and I used the type designed where you put the solution in the container put the tip of the container in one side of your nose lean over a sink and squeeze until the solution comes out the other nostril Then you repeat switching sides Its a little different design than the traditional nedi pot but I thought it might work better Unfortunately nothing much more than the solution came out But then about 10 minutes later my left nostril started dripping out a little of the solution which is not uncommon according to the directions in the kit So I leaned over the sink held closed my right nostril and blew out threw my left nostril expecting just some remaining solution to come out A few drops of solution did come out but then all of the sudden to my surprise a massive clump of very thick dark green mucus dropped out of my nostril I was shocked and amazed I had never seen anything like it before And the pain and pressure on the left side of my face was immediately gone The mucus that was stuck in my front sinus cavity was so thick that the only thing that could get down to it and jar it loose was the warm saline solution that I flushed through my nose and sinuses with the sinus flush kit And the solution that comes with the kit is a simple all natural saline solution which is safe enough for even a child to use So for anyone who has ever had sinus facial pain and pressure you must try this sinus flush And I know this might sound completely disgusting but I wish I had recorded myself doing this flush so I could see it again or even just show people what happened because even to this day I am still amazed at what came out of my nose that day And all from a kit that cost approx 10 I bought the generic store brand and took about 10 minutes to cure what weeks of taking multiple prescription medications and numerous doctor visits couldnt do Ask for a referral to another ENT Sounds like the inflammation is only getting worse they may tell you polyps Chicken noodle soup and the like helped to sooth my daughters irritation and they finally prescribed Augmentin cleared her up after Zpack and 2 others Good luck Sounds like when my bowel was blocked 4 days in Hosp Upper and lower GI Barium Xrays CT showed nothing blood work showed nothing at first Finally colonoscopy found 98 percent blockage and I had a bowel resection and was diagnosed with Chrohns This was after 7 years of treatment for IBS At least I know what I am fighting now Have lost 50lbs as well Best of luck Knowing is half the battle Contact your Physician who prescribed your latest antibiotic Ask them If it is not ok they will either send in some refills or ask you to come back in for further exams just wondering if he has ever had any problems with his heart that was the first thing that came to mind when i read your comment could be something more simple though i would keep trying to find out what is wrong i would get a second or even third opinon if needed  i have chronic mononucleosis and have all these symptoms but i usually have a fever for about a week before i have another attack 3 no my son takes that very often for his chronic lung diease and other premature side effects and it always gives him a attitude more so when he is done with the doses and always seems to have even more energy than he did without taking it also his pulse rate increases slightly and i have to deal with him getting passed what i believe to be withdrawns for 5 to 7 days after his last dose but that medicine works great for all kinds of things that he has come across and also boosts his lungs up to help them become stronger during a cold but weakens his immune system but the good over weights the bad when compared to any other medicine we have tried i have also noticed with myself and my son that medicine affect us in oppisite ways then others because most meds that should make you sleepy or more drained always makes us have the same or more energy and we almost can hide our sicknesses for the reason that it helps us not feel any sickness we might be going through The meds that are to help you be motivated or no side effects occurs to that meds makes us sleepy or feel sicker or drained and noticable to others that we r sick or not ourselves and under the wind Weird but true i prefer having prednisone then others its fast but effective only with the week after last dose my son wouldnt have withdrawn like effects i hope this is helpful in anyway and thank you for taking the time and reading my answer have a good day and God bless It could be viral instead of bacterial Were his symptoms different when he had the Xray If it was bacterrial generally the Complete blood count would show high White blood cells Has he had any cultures taken Marieh9 I would go back to the the doctor and make sure that it is not bacterial They can do a respiratory culture If it is viral it wil pass If it bacterial it could be resistant to the antibiotic prescribed Marieh9 I would tell the dentist that you stopped that antibiotic and why It is not good to quit them as you can develop resistant bacterial strains At this point it sounds like you have both a yeast infection from the first antibiotic which you can treat by using an OTC yeast treatment and the second sounds like a urinary tract infection I would see your doctor for a urinalysis which may involve a quick test andor a urine culture Report every thing you said here to the doctor Start drinking lots of cranberry juice if you are not diabetic and water It will help If the vagina itching doesnt go away such as the OTC product indicates see your doctor for that as well as it could be something else such as trichomonas But I believe it is yeast because you can develop it due to an antibiotic Marieh9 usually 7 days12 days Dont know if this is helpful or will even apply to your son but my nephew used to get ear infections all the time His mom let him go to sleep all the time with a bottle of milk and once she stopped doing that the ear infections stopped You said he is 4 so I doubt he still has a bottle but thought Id mention it anyway Hope he gets better soon I had hip replacement 3 yrs ago and had to take antibiotics for 3 weeks afterward so I dont think antibiotics should be an issue at all Assuming you are asking this question because you were told to let your dentist know that you had hip replacement I think the concern is more due to possible bleeding after certain dental procedures since Im sure you were on blood thinners for a period of time after your hip replacement ciprofloxacn and metronidazol are two meds I am on I am very sick to my stomach and blurred vision I have only one eye worry about that What to take for upset stomach I react to most antibotics I have dry eyes and also on pain meds My ophthalmologist started me on over the counter eye drops called Systane It lubricates the eyes and works great I buy it at Costco its cheaper than the drugstore Cafergot is a vasosuppressor with Ergotamine and Caffeine Usually given to people who have severe headaches and when OTC meds dont work It works well for certain types of headaches NO its not a narcotic well you could always have the doctor do a basic blood test to rule out infection because your white blood count would tell if infection is present  also 55 is a pretty normal age for the change of life  have you seen your gyn i think thats a good thing to bring up her  she can help rule out what it is and if it is the change of life she can help you try things to make it less of a problem in your everyday life hope this helped   yeast is inside your intestines its the stuff thathelps break down our food  but it is possible that sweating has cause some yeast to enter your vag area  i would say drink plenty of water to help it flush out and try to keep yourself extra clean to avoid it repeating  never heard f that before i would say its more likely to be the other way around if u have a abcess you should go to your dentist they can be life threatning if left untreated for a while the infection can go into your brain in short and cause your brain to shut down which ends in death your mouth most people dont think to take care of but remember its the closest thing to your brain  finish your meds by the doctor and go to the dentist its possible that the anti b they gave you wont help whats going on in your mouth they work on a different part of the body hope this helps it does take time if your coughing it up thats a good thing your bodies breaking it down and getting it out just take it day by day  i know how u feel i had one too and it got worse cause i hated the idea of staying stuffed and unable to breath  so i always blew my nose and it made it so much worse  youll be fine in to time  hope this helps HERBS HERBSHERBS find a good naturopath herbal practioner someone who is experienced with herbal remidies A good book for herbal remedies is BACK TO EDEN by JETHRO KLOSS Their are tons of herbal books nowadays find the one best for you or your condition Most drugs you get at pharmacy are herbs leaves off of trees roots from plants the plants themselves tree barks research research get R done  HERBS people HERBS try mryhh or goldenseal tea wash with this and then sprinkle some of the herb on it and cover with bandaid or clean cloth Repeat if needed Read up on herbal remidies  library and or web or bookstore First off Antibiotics are not used to treat a yeast infection Actually for some women they can cause a yeast infection A yeast infection can be treated with an oral pill called Diflucan It has to be prescribed by a doctor I recommend going to the doctor Explain that you are a virgin and that you know it is not an STD The doctor should be able to go by the symptoms you describe and give you what is needed While you are there feel free to talk about a pelvic exam and what you should expect when you are ready to get one Good Luck Antibiotics are not an enemy You dont have to worry about killing your immune system The only time people really have to worry about antibiotics is if they take them on a regular basis over and over again andor when they dont need them As you have only taken them once that you know of Im sure you are in the clear As for the strep throat the best defense is hand hygeine Wash your hand often and use hand sanitizer Homeopathic remedies can and do work so dont give those up Just remember that if you have a fever that lasts more than a day or two or a sore throat with difficulty swallowing for a week or more you should probably see a doctor It sounds to me like you may have GERD or acid reflux Ive never had heart burn but I do have GERD It started with a bad taste in the back of my throat and a nasty tasting cough I could also feel it in my sinuses The acid from your stomach can affect your voice as well Look up GERD here on WebMD It seems like you have quite a few of the symptoms Good Luck Its time to go back to the doctor It is possible that the antibiotic you were given was not strong enough or you werent on it long enough It could even be that you need a different antibiotic Go to the doctor before it gets worse I used to get strep once or twice a year I received the same treatment just about every time The antibiotics I received usually made me feel better about two to three days after consistent use Gone within a week Based upon my personal experience along with my husband daughter and now hundreds of people that I have come to know through a variety of venues I am a professional counselor with 30 years of experience your symptoms can absolutely be attributed to persistent borrelia Lyme infection and perhaps coinfections I strongly recommend you review the International Lyme and Associated Diseases ILADS website for uptodate and accurate information Because of what comes down to what is now willful ignorance many doctors are poiltical hacks rather than physicians like the expert who gave you horrible advice on this forum If this is a true allergy opposed to an adverse effect ie hives swelling etc Here are a list of antibioitic you should not take Any cephalosporin  Keflex rocephin ceclor omnicef are some of the common examples Any penicillin  Amocicillin Augmentin PennVK etc If its simply an adverse reaction such as belly pain diarrhea or other similar adverse reaction there are no restrictions Yes they have done urine tests blood tests CAT scan etc They cant seem to find anything wrong other than vaginosis Try Betnovet it works if your acne are no more I have had shingles and I only had it around my upper back but I know it can apprear just about anywhere I would highly reccommend seeing a doctor because even though it can go away without antibiotics I believe it can also get worse and be very miserable It is up to you if it seems to be improving then maybe you dont need to but if its spreading then you definitely should see a doctor It can get pretty serious if left untreated I would not recommend going around someone who is pregnant even though shingles is spread through direct contact just because it can be very serious and it isnt something someone who is pregnant should be exposed to Just opinion here but maybe its not bacterial or maybe its MRSA Have to consider viral or fungal infection If so then antibiotics would be ineffective Think outside the box Is this a person that has had numerous antibiotics thru their life Our society believes you should get antibiotics for everything whether they are indicated or not Maybe try antifungal or antiviral med if nothing else is working Immune system is probably compromised already so last ditch might be steroids Just thinking to myself Hope this helps Bless you have u had a colonoscopy what took place before having this prob sounds more like colitis need colonoscopy to confirm Had simalar problem and could not get any answers Researched simalar conditions for over two years finally found a possibile answer not a cure but keeps them at bay Cut Out All Pork Out of your diet Read all Labels and take caution no chips fried in pork fat no lunch meat no canned meats etcetc It took me about three months for the bacteria enzymes  what ever it is in pork to get purged out of my system and it worked Have not had any reoccurances since then It may be worth a shot aint gonna hurt Good Luck Levaquin has a ton of negative side affectsI would stay away from it no go to the hospital anything over 105 can cause brain damage strep throat I have been taking Percacet for neck and back pain I am required periodically to have a urine test at the doctors office to verify that I am taking my meds On 2 seperate times I have been taking one or two different kinds of anibiotics for an oral problem where my dentist opened my sinus passage when he pulled a tooth and my urinalisis came back negative for the percacet and I know I am taking the meds but now my doctor doesnt trust me but this has only happened when I have been on antibiotics Can these perscription antibiotics be causing the negative result for the percacet Thank you for any assistance you can give me I am a 50 year old male three major neck surgeriesdegenerative bone disease in my lower back with a buldging disk also on high blood pressure meds and water pill that makes me go to the bathroom approx 25 times a day ropinarol for leg pain and amitriptaline to help sleepdepressionthank you yes you need to have it surgically removed if it is done properly and packed from the inside to heal you have much less a chance for it to come back i had a pylonital cyst that was the size of a baseball that was draining i had it lanced and drained and wicks put in but it did not go away until i had it surgically removed being diabetic the infection feeds off your diabeties causing high sugars which will cause the infection to get worse too and yes because of your diabeties you can loose your arm or worse if you do not get it taken care of properly his symptoms were exactly the same then as they are nowjust no real improvement since being on the antibiotic I had a UTI very painful My urine flow was very week had the urge to go but not much and some pain A few days later the pain was unbearable and I ended up having a kidney stone that was 7mm in size small but in kidney stone size it was a boulder It had completely blocked my right kidney I was sent to a urologist and he scheduled me for a simple one day surgery Ultrasound waves to bust it up So far Ive had no trouble Fluid in the ear is most annoying and can be damaging to your ear I caution you though about the decision to have tubes put in the ear drum to drain this fluid I had tubes in for about 2 years they fell out I actually had the little tiny plastic rings They are less tubes than just little rings of plastic Most often the ear drum heals itself after the tubes fall out mine did not I now have very tiny holes in my ear drums this is a problem I cannot swim in a lake for fear the water will enter into the ear and this water can carry many nasty little bugs viruses bacteria and so on Many lakes in my area end up at one time or another have to be closed to swimmers due to high bacteria counts ecoli is just one of the many things that can be found in lake water You do not want this to fester in your ear Can be allergies sinus infection or who knows There is something called an expectorant which can be bought overthecounter which helps to break up the congestion and eliminate it from the bodyusually in spitting out phlegm balls gross From being so anxious about your period being late delays it a bit more Since your EPT came out negative you can relax for a week or so Being placed on the antibiotics have an affect on menses If you havent gotten it by todays date then by all means go to a gynocologist  that doctor will take tests with an exam to determine whats going on 2448 hours depends on whats wrong  I just had a colonoscopy and was told I had a bleeding ulcer and acid reflux I had absolutely no symptoms for either I had a little swallowing and that was the reason for the test I think you should get it checked or take a picture of it to see if it changes you should have saved the tick also watch for a bullseye shape mark that would be bad It will take sometime to get cure from acne problem in severe conditions but not impossible You wrote about the medicines applied to your acne problem like antibiotics Why cant you try natural skin care products for your problem I have been heard from some of my friends that they have been healed from acne problem by using some natural products which are manufactured from the products of Vanuatu what does your dermatologist say about this or primary physician both need to be seen If you have had lyme disease and did not take antibiotics until you were symptom free it will return  I know it happened to me because I could not get treatment I needed because of lack of knowledge from infectious disease doctors  long term lyme disease required IV antibiotics to penetrate the underlying tissues  you need to see a lyme literate doctor who has success in treating lyme disease  wwwiladsorg Yes Your sinuses run all through your head so when you have an infection it can cause your equilibrium to be off One thing that will give you some relief is try taking some mucinex When I have sinusitis I have pains in my head I never thought could be there I usually take mucinex and pseudoephedrine You will have to ask for the pseudo because they keep it behind the counter at the pharmacy and also some ibuprofen helps with the pain You need to go see a Rheumatologist They do a special test  A Touch Feel Test You have to have so many spots to have been diagnosed w fibromyalgia
