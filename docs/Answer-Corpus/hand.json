{"text": "I had same problem wneck Please go get Cat scan they blew it off cause I was too young to have Throat Cancer Well I just finished operation on inside of throat 29 treatments of chemotherapy and radiation for STAGE 4 THROAT CANCER FROM HPV Good luck Having difficulty getting the answer to the question previous asked If the mark looked like a target it possibly could have been a tick and in that case you would want to get treatment for lyme disease It could be the lotion Even though its meant to moisturize an inexpensive lotion can contain alcohol and other drying chemicals and some of these substances can cause dermatitis or allergic reactions Keep in mind too that a lotion is actually meant to be absorbed so it doesnt really do the trick as a lube Youre better off using a waterbased personal lubricant meant for the purpose and you can follow up when youre done by washing and then applying a penis health creme health professionals recommend Man1 Man Oil to soothe moisturize and rejuvenate the skin Yes RA can cause a lot of problems I would get it checked as soon as possible before it gets any worse It can just being something small and simple and an easy fix But definitely get it checked Possibly but with my experience with scabies is youre more likely to start itching when they burrow However that isnt always the case for everyone My step kids got them and one was itching all the time where as the other didnt start itching until the spots started to show up which means they have burrowed I am not a professional but thats what i was told when i went to the doctor with them A persistent rash needs to be evaluated by your general doctor or a dermatologist a skin doctor Hives urticaria are red itchy raised areas of the skin that can range in size and appear anywhere on your body The cause of the hives can be drugs foods stress and is unknown in many cases The fact that the rash appears anywhere on your body suggests this diagnosis Hives are an allergic reaction and those with asthma and allergies are more prone If the cause of your hives can be identified you should avoid that trigger Some drugs and foods take days to leave the body so your doctor may prescribe antihistamines in the meantime to relieve your symptoms Contact dermatitis is another possible explanation for your rash This rash occurs when certain substances come into contact with your skin Contact dermatitis causes a localized rash on the skin which may be red sore itchy and have bumps or blisters There are two kinds of contact dermatitis irritant or allergic Irritant contact dermatitis is more often painful than itchy and is caused by a substance damaging the part of your skin where it comes into contact Contact with acids soaps detergents fabric softeners or other chemicals may cause irritant contact dermatitis The reaction often occurs on the hands and is frequently workrelated Allergic contact dermatitis is caused by exposure to a substance or material to which you have become extra sensitive or allergic Common causes include fabrics clothing soaps and nail polish Rubber gloves are one of the most frequent causes of occupational allergic contact dermatitis especially in health care workers Seeking professional help from your doctor is the safest way to determine what is causing your rash No she wont get pregnant The vagina is full of toxic chemicals to kill of bacteria and even semen About 70 semen from a full ejaculation is killed from the natural toxic chemicals created by the female reproductive system even before it reaches the uterus So if I were you I wouldnt stress out too much about your girlfriend getting pregnant cause the chances of your semen reaching an egg is about a 110000 chance No You can contract STI through vaginal intercourse oral sex sharing needles On the rarest occasion you can also contract STI if the infected persons blood gets into your blood stream Youve got nothing to worry about Your testicle probably had a negative reaction to something From my perspective its nothing serious but I would recommended that you visit your local doctor and get it looked at Whether you feel these lumps may be cancerous or common I highly advise you to see your physician and accordingly the doctor may or may not order additional testss However If the lump is painful and can be rolled around chances are it may be a cyst of some kind and can be easily treated I have a personal story I had a horribly painful lump in my armpit and was more than frightened about the diagnosis of cancer I did make an appointment with my physician and after a full examination of the area and an ultrasound it was found that the area was a severely ingrown hair and the area had to be lanced and drained Simple wound care was required for a couple of weeks following the procedure Evidently there is a large percentage of women who shave our underarms incorrectly There is a name for these women They are known as rakers A raker is someone that glides the razor over and around the underarm area in an irratic manner across the direction of hair growth against the direction of hair growth whatever gets the job done and it causes irritation or folliculitis inflammation of the hair follicle and even an ingrown hair which can become extremely sore and enlarged due to the inflammation The correct procedure for shaving your underarms is as follows Start with wetting the underarm area with lukewarm water apply shaving cream specific to the sensitive area of the underarm area and use a great quality razor either disposable or reusable NEVER A DULL RAZOR Always glide the razor WITH the direction of hair growth This is information that you can use all the time especially if those painful underarm lumps are diagnosed as being ingrown underarm hair This is not to replace a visit or an examination by your physician ALWAYS SEE YOUR PHYSICIAN FOR ANY ABNORMALITIES FOUND IN THE BREAST LYMPH NODES OR UNDERARMS THIS CAN NOT BE STRESSED TOO MANY TIMES Im not a doctor but my son 10 had a dot appear on both his palms symetrical positions the most persuasive answer we have had from friends is that its like shingles The explanation is that his emotional stress he has a lot unfortunately affects his nerves producing these abnormalities Some believe this explains the miracle of stigmata for some pepole In the past when I have been able to physically pull something out of the surface of my skin it has only been a  I once thought I was forming a new freckle only to find out it a very enlarged black head As a  I would say to ensure she has a clean face every morning and night and consult a dermatologist if things persist or worsen I dont think you have anything to worry about When a man actually ejaculates into a woman the ejaculation forces the sperm up there to impregnate her so it is very unlikely that just a tiny bit of precum on your underwear would get you pregnant Even if you had a whole load of semen IN your underwear it would still be very unlikely to cause a pregnancy httpwwwlivestrongcomarticle227799symptomsofsmallvesselbraindisease Go to this website and it will give you more information and will give you other sites for more information but not it isnt neuropathy of the brain so to speak but other factors such as build up of plaque in the veins that is the issue and when the plaque builds up it narrows the arteries Check this website out though for more information The best of luck to you and GOD BLESS I know from my own experience with arthritis that your complaint sounds very much like arthritis You should however see a Dr for it as there is a difference between Osteoarthritis and Rhuematoid Arthritis Either way a true Dx should be made Arthritis comes in different forms But some hallmark signs of most arthritic conditions include pain joint swelling and difficultly in articulating the movement of joints Some of the symptoms listed in your question could be signs of an arthritic conditionThey could also be signs of some other medical disorders Arthritis can affect individuals of any age but its diagnosis increases as we age As most doctors can attest to many of their patients complain of back pain after reaching 40 years of age An xray of those painful 40 something old backs may show as the only notable impression the fact that arthriticdegenerative changes were observed I suggest that you make an appointment with the family doctor who may assess your discomfort and any range of motion limitations That same person may get the diagnostic ball rolling by requesting xray images ordering blood work and other lab studiesThe general practicing physician may also start you on some regime of antinflammatory and pain medication as well as referring you to other medical specialists such as orthopedists or rheumatologists I hope that you have found this answer helpful and that your pain cramping and fist closure issues resolve themselves soon  Sure you could have depression or anxiety Ask many doctors what brought most patients into their office for treatment and theyll tell you that its stress driven It doesnt matter if it is a cold or hypertension or some other malady it is a fact that our bodies process emotional stress through negative physical complaints It does not mean that you are behaving strangely it just means that you are human and living in a faced paced society in 2014 So what action do you take After all it is not normal to feel the way that you feel and dangerous to your overall health Here are my suggestions Discuss the symptoms listed in your posting with a family doctor Have a complete physical examination to ruleout physical disease Eat a healthy diet and engage in regular exercise as permitted by your doctor Enroll in a yoga class or stress reduction class Secure some close friendships to share your feelings Enroll in a volunteer activity Enroll in a fun class like dancing to meet new people to learn something new and to occupy your spare time Listen to music of your choosing Surround yourself with positive people Take a nice vacation Drink plenty of water If all else fails do not hesitate to meet with a professional counselor or visit a stress reduction support group Medications may also help but are usually not necessary and should be a means of last resort It is suggested that the characteristics of upper extremities bleeding easily with delayed healing should be assessed by a medical professional This condition in the elderly has the strange name of  Senile Purpura Some of the reasons for bleeding easily may be attributable to delays in the blood coagulating andor platelet help blood to clot disorders Other conditions such as liver disease hemophilia and the taking of medications such as aspirinwarfarin blood thinner type agents can also be responsible for your easy bruising and excessive time to heal The following WebMD link will open a link for an article that discusses the reasons behind bleeding and clotting disorders that cause bruising httpwwwwebmdcomskinproblemsandtreatmentsbleedingorclottingdisordersthatcausebruising It is recommended that you make an appointment with your family doctor to have a complete medical exam routine lab works and the updating of your medical history I hope that this answer has been helpful My answer is meant to be constructive and not intended as a judgmental criticism by labeling your condition as being caused by alcohol abuse You could be experiencing a condition called alcoholic neuropathy  The symptoms as you describe them may be signs of nerve damage which can be permanent If you stop drinking your pain and the tenderness feelings may diminish due to an improved nutritional balance within the body Besides terminating your alcohol intake through approved treatment methods Detox Rehabilitation Talk Therapy Medications 12 Step AA Program Involvementetc  taking B vitamins such a B12 and Thiamin and seeing a neurologist are advisable steps to be taken You can stop drinking alcohol and prevent other serious medical problems This is best accomplished by being vigorously honest with yourself and seeking addiction help I wish you well  There could be a relation between the 2 conditions but the jury is still out Although it is difficult to find clinical studies that produced data with convincing arguments of a relationship internet forums are loaded with individuals who suffer simultaneously from both conditions Some doctors are writing Off Label prescriptions for their peripheral neuropathy patients with medications used to treat bipolar conditions Gabapentin is one medication that seems to have a positive result in treating both disorders Peripheral neuropathy comes in many forms and it not always easily diagnosed In addition to the Chiropractors opinion it may benefit you to see a neurologist have a through physical exam and additional diagnostic testing completed in order to confirm that you have peripheral neuropathy  A certain amount of edema tissue fluid buildup in the arms hands ankles and feet is a normal occurrence for a woman in her 3rd trimester of pregnancy Drinking additional amounts of water can be a helpful form of treatment for your edematous condition  I recommend that you contact your doctor about the swelling of your face and puffiness around your eyes It is important to eliminate a serious medical condition as the cause for your facial and eye symptoms One of those serious medical conditions is called preeclampsia Preeclampsia can cause a spike in blood pressure and result in kidney function irregularities Conclusion Most women experience swelling of the arms hands legs ankles and feet during pregnancy A sudden swelling of the face and puffiness around the eyes should be assessed by a medical professional I hope that this answer has been helpfulBest wishes for the upcoming birth of your child May labor and delivery be a positive experience full of joy  Second hand smoke is tobacco smoke exhaled by a smoker and involuntarily breathed in by another person Here are some 2nd hand smoke facts according to the National Cancer Society At least 69 chemicals produced by 2nd hand smoke are known to cause cancer 2nd hand smoke does cause cancer in nonsmokers 2nd hand smoke has also been associated with heart disease in adults and ear infections asthma sudden death syndrome in children 2nd hand smoke has no safe exposure level I am not an expert on building structures or their air circulation systems and do not have technical details of your buildings air circulation system With that said Ill provide my understanding of the air quality in many office buildings occupied today and referred to as sick buildings These buildings may have poor air exchange systems filtering systems that are inadequate in size not adequately cleaned or otherwise properly maintained My own anecdotal accounting is that many of these types of building almost never receive fresh air as windows are only for the aesthetic purpose of providing natural light The windows are sometimes permanently fixed shut In effect the building occupants may be continually breathing the same polluted air Irritations of the eyes ears and throats are frequent complaints of these building occupants due in part to chemical and environmental containments from indoor and outdoor sources In summary 2nd hand smoke is dangerous It can cause cancer and other chronic health problems Many office buildings today circulate unhealthy air  My conclusion is that your health problems at least in part may be due to the effects of 2nd hand smoke being breathed in while working in your office building  I completely understand why you want to begin HGH treatment Here is the bad news At the age of 1819 years old you will probably continue to meet opposition to your treatment request Heres why Youre probably already considered to be an adult The last thing that I remember reading about HGH treatment is that the FDA has not granted approval for adults to be treated with this drug for short stature situations Approved usage for short stature is limited to children Adults may be prescribed the medication only for some other limited medical reasons The FDA position is probably based on the fact that a human stops growing when the epiphyseal growth plates seal This sealing usually occurs naturally at various ages starting at 13 and ending at about 22 Girls usually dont grow much after age 15 while boys may see some growth through age 22 Even with HGH treatment the body will not grow after the sealing process has occurred My suggestion is to make an appointment with an openminded endocrinologist specialist  There is nothing to lose by discussing your growth and physical development options with a knowledgeable and caring doctor It seems that the first doctor may have just brushed you off Perhaps it is not too late to begin treatment Were all unique individuals who start and stop growing at various ages But even with a progressive endocrinologist supportive of your request the process can be cumbersome Testing in the form of serum blood studies physical examinations electronic body scans referrals to other medical specialist and possible mental health suitability clearances may be necessary Here are a few more pieces of information to consider before agreeing to HGH treatment Taking HGH is serious business as many side effects have been reported HGH treatment can cost anywhere from 1000000 per year up to 3000000 per year While being 52 or 53 may not be a desirable height right now in your eyes most other people really do not care much about that singular physical trait As we mature it becomes even more of a nonissue in our own mind and in our daily interactions with others  Trauma cannot be excluded  and therefore the fall and tendon injury could be the source of your trigger finger condition I suspect that since youre receiving PT that youve had diagnostic tests such as xrays to ruleout other possible events such as a facture occurring during your accident In trigger finger there is restriction of the flexor tendon The cause has been attributed to inflamation The exact etiology is open to debate but repetitive use frequent and forceful squeezing of tools and hyperextension are on the top of list for its origin It is possible that hyperextension occurred during your fall Treatment efforts consist of cortisone injections immobilization and surgery After 2 injections of cortisone without positive resolution surgery is usually a consideration Below is a link to a WebMd article on the topic httpwwwwebmdcomosteoarthritisguidetriggerfinger  I havent seen any studies absolutely confirming a link between essential tremors and shingles But there are plenty of web type anecdotal accountings of their common development in some individuals for me to see a connection It was interesting to see that the drug Pregablin  As described in an article on BioPorfolio was approved by FDA to treat nerve pain as sometimes seen with essential tremor conditions It was also approved to treat nerve pain associated with diabetes and shingles Gabapentin Neurontin based upon my personal experience is an effective medication to treat neuropathy It is also used to treat seizures restless leg syndrome and other neurological conditions Hopefully Gabpentin will be titrated for you to an effective dosage level where your neuralgia will be under control Gabapentin comes in capsules and pills up to 800 mg During clinical trials Gabapentin showed effectiveness with daily level between 1800 mg and 3600 mg Your prescribed dosage will be individualized according to height weight sex age and your medical condition  Nohard thank you for your answer Your suggested article was interesting and appreciated I had read that Tart Cherry Juice specifically contains antiinflammatory properties which helps with nerve control may improve gout symptoms and protects against muscle damage and the development of arthritis Im taking a leap of hope that some WebMd posters may have tried Tart Cherry Juice and can report on their experiences I m looking for some reliable accountings from our peers to either support or refute what I had read The product is somewhat pricy but worth it if is effective in treating back pain Additional details since I ran out of room Ive done so much research and havent found an answer as to what they could possibly be be caused from or if theres any way to get rid of them I dont think theyre cherry angiomas and dont seem to be petechiae which is the closest thing resembling what I have it just doesnt look the same My normal doc didnt even have an answer said since the spots fade when pressed theres nothing to worry about That doesnt make me any less self conscious though or tell me how to get rid of them if its possible This is another photo that shows it as its worst httpwwwaskthedoctorcomquestionsimagesSmallredpinkspotsrashlikeareasonhandsandarmsthatfadeawaywhenpressedonimg0jpg Dry skin is common as we age but conditions such as eczema and psoriasis can also lead to extremely dry and cracked skin Applying a daily moisturizers especially after showering limiting showing time and bathing in warm  not hot water help One major tip is to use skin products that contain petroleum or lanolin These help seal moisture in the skin They also produce a barrier that protects against the loss of natural oils within the skin If the symptoms persist despite these simple tips and a change in your routine its time to see a dermatologist A history and physical is what a dermatologist will look at to determine the cause Occasionally other tests such as a thyroid panel or Vitamin D level may be needed I too am on blood pressure medicine and am very swollen in the legs ankles feet hands and fingers Not so sure that my belly isnt swollen somewhat I just read on WebMD that increasing water and cutting down on sodium and exercising is a big help I just wanted to add that I am on 2 mood stabilizers and was told that the family of drugs can be a reason for retaining fluid One of the side effects is weight gain so yay  Check all of the medicines that you take to see the side effects and then report this to your doctor like I did He cut my medicine in half Im afraid because these meds can also raise my cholesterol and my liver function which are culprits for edema as well I think Are either of you allergic to other meds Seems like my body has changed and am having allergic reactions to Chantix and Cipro and have been allergic to NSAIDS since 2005 had to go to the hospital because of the swelling in my throat  tongue Ive never had food or drug allergies before Ive also been told that Im menopausal now and that could be part of my weightgain problem but I think a lot of it is swelling Hope that we all get the swelling under control its very aggravating and causes pain in those areas after a while I dont know about the lice or STDs but I know I feel cleaner by shaving I also used to get a fair amount of yeast infections when I was younger and didnt shave And Im happy to say that in the 30 yrs since Ive been shaving I havent had even one infection That tells me Ive removed the moist warm habitat for some infections And my OBGYN agrees with me on that Plus EVERYTHING is better all the way around What is your question regarding neuropathy My question my little dog has a wart like breakout to of head back leg with around her buttocks I just started applying Compound W will this help 1 No 2 Lubrcation minimizes the risk if the condom broke it would have broke completely  think of how rubber breaks Yes the warts can For your any dental problem plz click here  confidentdentalcare  For your any dental problem plz click here  confidentdentalcare  For your any dental problem click here  confidentdentalcare Whats my answer Waiting for your answer to my question Elastic stockings Keeping your legs elevated while sitting in a chair or lying down Avoiding long periods of sitting Not crossing your legs Mild exercise such as a stroll around your neighborhood Wearing shoes that fit properly Good luck YES It sounds like to be like some sort of cyst Especially the way you describe it You should see your Doctor about it and he may be able to tell you what it is or help with a prescription It could honestly be anything There is a high chance it is painful anxiety there could be inflammation or even something to do with your posture I used to continually get pains in my arm and occasional backache once I sorted out my posture and weight I was slightly over weight and fixed my bra size everything eased I have had neuropathy for 11 years now I have had six surgeries in left foot to either remove nerves or cut them I have also had injections into nerves to permanently kill them Each time I was told this would help NOT The best thing I have found so far unfortunately is medicine As for the valtrex Im not an expert or anything it is important that you definitely need to check with the doc and make sure that there is no danger in you NOT taking the meds They may still require you to take them Obviously none of us are medical experts so all I can tell you is my opinion on what I would dothink if I were in your situation Tunnel vision is a medical condition that results in a loss of peripheral vision As a result the patient can only see objects from within a circular field This condition has many possible causes including problems in the brain some eye diseases hallucinogenic drugs and certain extreme activities Blood loss to parts of the brain can lead to tunnel vision as can a tumor pressing against the optic never fibers A person who is exposed to air that has been contaminated by oils and hydraulic fluids such as may happen in an airplane and during hard exercise may also develop this condition Becoming ill while in an aircraft can cause temporary vision problems The pressure placed on the optic nerve causes the eye to lose retinal ganglion cells which can eventually cause the patient to go blind For some patients a loss of peripheral vision may be experienced prior to blindness Thank you for respondingIve had hypo for 9 years but my last tsh was 01 which is new for me because in the past it was always 10 somethingSo does that make me hyper nowConfusedI am haveing some symtoms of fibro I think This just all started when I found out my thyroid was way offHelp Your symptoms do not show a need of a xray You have the answer on some other page in webmd please go to  Wart remover products in the drugstore contain usually salicylic acid I dont like the ones that have the freeze because its not cold enough to really cause enough damage to kill the wart virus And oftentimes it can leave a scar on the skin So that would be done by your dermatologist using liquid nitrogen which is really really cold and will eliminate the skin where the wart virus lives and then the wart virus is gone So its important to note that wart virus is everywhere Anything you touch chances are you are being exposed to wart virus So dont be so concerned about having it transmitted to somebody else if you shake hands thats not as much of a concern Its more just to get rid of it because its uncomfortable Also it doesnt go beyond the skin So this is truly simply a condition of the skin Some people are more prone to it genetically than others and sometimes more at some ages than others The treatments that contain salicylic acid work pretty well but they take time Another treatment that has great medical literature behind it that shows it works as well as the inoffice treatments that we do as dermatologist is duct tape So I think every house or apartment comes with duct tape I havent seen one house where it doesnt exist I think its just magically there when you buy a house its just in your house You cut it slightly bigger than the size of the wart and wash the skin dry it well and then put it on the skin and hold your hand to the outside to warm the glue to the skin so it sticks really well It seems that the glue is toxic to that wart virus and the thickness of the tape suffocates it Then after three days you just peel that off and put a new one on If you dont like the way that silver duct tape looks you can put a bandage over it and it works great for wart virus of the foot as well As dermatologists and plastic surgeons we do a lot of treatments to help rejuvenate the hands I find that besides the eyes the hands really can give away age very readily So while we can make the face look so much better if you dont also treat the hands that can give things away So besides lasers we can use dermal fillers to actually plump up and rejuvenate the skin of the hands in a very safe and effective way Ask you dermatologist or plastic surgeon if they are comfortable with this procedure and they will tell you if thats something that would be appropriate for you Sun protection and regular moisturizing Dont overwash and be sure to moisturize after each wash Also you can apply facial antiaging moisturizers on the back of your hands at night when you wont be constantly washing your hands Sun protection and regular moisturizing Dont overwash and be sure to moisturize after each wash Also you can apply facial antiaging moisturizers on the back of your hands at night when you wont be constantly washing your hands Not being a Doctor Ican only say from experince Sounds like either youe circulation is poor or your O2 level is low Do you have any numbness or tinkling associated with these periods  Hope you get your answer I think youve hit the nail on the head Usually when someone describes pain or sensation as electrical we think its nerverelated The same is true for pain described as stinging shocking or burning If the sensation occurs all the way from the shoulder to the fingertips then its possible youre experiencing a spinal nerve compression at the neck If the sensation is more from the elbow on down or something then you may be experiencing irritation or compression of a nerve where it goes through a joint like the elbow You can find out for sure whats going on by making an appointment with your primary care provider He or she can evaluate the situation and send you for tests or refer you to a specialist Hope this helps Im sorry to hear youre going through this It sounds very distressing Unfortunately the only way to diagnose whats causing this problem is by physical examination I suggest you consult your primary health care provider to discuss your symptoms and have some testing done A number of conditions can cause the symptoms you describe so please dont jump to any dire conclusions until you see a medical professional Take care The odds of your getting pregnant under the circumstances you describe is slim to none Sperm do not survive well outside their natural environment in the male reproductive organs Sperm have a hard enough time surviving inside the vagina which is hostile to sperm let alone taking on saliva and the mechanical crushing of mastication Especially if youre describing semen transfer from the hands to the mouth while ingesting food or a beverage the odds any sperm would survive to subsequently impregnate you during oral sex is infinitesimal Of course you should always practice safe sex when youre truly having sex and if you dont want to become pregnant then you have a responsibility to use some sort of birth control yourself A condom helps protect against sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy and you increase your chances of staying pregnancyfree by using a second birth control method such as the pill or an IUD Hope this helps The key phrase in your question is this I was playing video games at the time Since the numbness is confined to the tip of your thumb chances are youre suffering from a repetitive motion injury Any activity that involves the same movement of the hands and fingers over and over again can cause irritation of the nerves that supply them In the extreme this can cause loss of movement and severe pain In your case it sounds like you may have irritated a nerve that carries sensory impulses to the brain That tiny nerve ending apparently has stopped working The good news is if this is indeed a repetitve motion injury you can improve the situation by resting your hand for awhile Avoid playing any video games and see if the situation improves If not see your health care provider for further evaluation Just to be clear the in men generally include a crushing or squeezing sensation in the middle of the chest chest pain pain or numbness radiating down the left arm andor into the left jaw shortness of breath faintness or nausea And dont think just because youre only 19 years old that a heart attack would be out of the question While its unlikely a heart attack can strike people of almost any age particularly if theyre sedentary andor overweight I can see why it might sound logical that calcium supplementation could help heal faster After all bones are made of calcium right So feeding them calcium should speed up healing Unfortunately thats not how it works Unless you have a preexisting calcium deficiency not likely in an otherwise healthy 16yearold boy taking calcium will not help your bones heal The process of bone healing is called remodeling Your body removes dead bone cells and builds new ones in their place This process occurs on a pretty predictable schedule For common fractures like the one you describe the remodeling process normally takes 6 to 8 weeks Unfortunately your son will just have to wait this out What help the bones heal on schedule is not engaging in activities that put stress on the areas of the fracture Resting the hand to keep the fractures stable will allow the body to do its remodeling job and get the bones back to normal Wishing you well Im sorry youre going through this It sounds awful I have to state though that are not diagnosed by biopsy This makes me question whether or not youve actually seen a medical professional about the situation Regardless the fact your partner now exhibits the same symptoms means you both need to get to a doctor  sooner rather than later Its possible you have some systemic internal disease process that requires attention Sinec the situation has been going on for some time and you do not report any problems breathing or with swelling inside your throat I suggest you seek nonemergency medical attention as soon as possible Wishing you well Dehydration probably wont cause this symptom but many other conditions can Usually the cause of the hands andor feet and legs turning blue isnt serious  unless there are other symptoms involved such as shortness of breath or a fever Depending on a persons skin color the extremities sometimes can look quite blue This is true of very fairskinned people Id suggest your daughter get checked out for this There are a few disorders that can cause this blueness of the extremities Sometimes these disorders actually point to other conditions that can be treated or should be watched as your daughter ages I wish you both all the best From what youre describing these two events dont seem to be related If the skin cracking youre now experiencing occurs at a different place on the finger from where the cut was then the cut has nothing to do with whats going on right now Cracking of the skin around the nail area is not an uncommon problem especially in the winter when the air dries out due to artificial heating using the furnace or when the hands are placed in water for long periods of time If you work in a job that requires you to place your hands in water  particularly any water that contains chemicals such as dishwashing soap disinfectants that sort of thing  you should be provided with rubber gloves to protect your hands You also would be well advised to wear rubber gloves at home whenever you work with water to help prevent this skin cracking youre experiencing Its impossible to say whats causing this exactly If your health care provider prescribed steroid cream it makes me wonder if he or she diagnosed this as a  But Im not going to speculate here Since the situation is bothering you Id suggest making another appointment with your primary care provider or whoever prescribed the steroid cream to discuss the situation and the diagnosis Your PCP will be able to tell you how to manage this situation All the best to you In case you didnt know it isnt caused by a worm at all Ringworm is actually a skin fungus just like athletes foot or jock itch You can get ringworm in a variety of ways from sharing a towel with someone whos infected to touching damp surfaces that carry the fungus The fungus that causes ringworm thrives in warm damp environments which is why its frequently acquired in places like public pool common areas To your question You could catch ringworm from your friend even if you didnt touch the lesion The reason is because the fungus could be infecting other areas of your friends skin but not showing the characteristic ring mark yet If you have thoroughly washed and DRIED the skin areas that came in contact with your friend youre probably not going to get ringworm However be careful not to share any sports gear or towels with your friend and be sure to wear flipflops or other foot protection if you all are bathing in a common shower area or something like that By the way ringworm will not clear up on its own It needs to be treated with an antifungal preparation Your friend can try using an overthecounter cream for athletes foot the generic name is miconazole but if that doesnt help or if the ringworm starts spreading your friend should seek medical attention In rare instances ringworm is best treated with a prescription medication Hope this helps Yes Im sure there is a rational explanation for this The problem is you wont get that explanation unless you see a medical professional for a physical exam Before I jumped to a conclusion of  Id think in terms of lessscary explanations like a problem with a disc in your neck That might account for the arm weakness Muscle twitching can be caused by several things including a mild potassium deficiency Is the toe twitching related to the arm weakness Maybe Maybe not Your primary health care provider is in the best position to start putting all the pieces of this puzzle together because he or she knows your medical history current medications and supplements and so on Id suggest you call and make an appointment to get the ball rolling toward a diagnosis Meanwhile I wouldnt get too worried about this being something scary like MS Well both hope its something easily explained and easily treated Wishing you all the best Im sorry youre experiencing this Its always concerning when something weird starts happening with our bodies Many conditions could cause the symptoms you describe come to mind but its impossible to diagnose a skin problem without seeing it in person I suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider or a dermatologist to get a proper diagnosis Its possible your skin lumps are easily treatable  or that they dont need treatment at all But only a health care provider can tell you for sure Best wishes In general basic first aid for any is constant flushing with water preferably distilled water but tap water will do for a minimum of 15 minutes While youre doing this have someone else call 911 for emergency assistance The flushing should be gentle but continuous Gently hold the eye open while allowing the water to run across the eyeball and down into the sink Its helpful to hold your head sideways at a 90degree angle to accomplish this When emergency medical assistance arrives try to give them the container of the chemical you got in your eye This will help them determine what further treatment you need Hope this helps It sounds to me like you need to visit a doctor Im sorry if that sounds flippant but its the truth Critically low vitamin levels can cause serious physical problems That said I question where youre getting your data Blood levels of vital nutrients hormones like testosterone and other substances can only be measured by a blood test A blood test can only be ordered by a licensed health care practitioner such as a doctor nurse practitioner or physician assistant If your health care provider ordered tests that returned a result of critically low levels then that individual should have followed up with you to instruct you how to proceed such as taking vitamin supplements or whatever If you believe you are experiencing symptoms related to a lack of specific vitamins or hormones you clearly should see a health care provider as soon as possible Wishing you well Im sorry about your accident I think you need to get this checked out by a medical professional The coldness of your hand and arm could be a sign of poor blood circulation related to your accident Poor blood circulation can lead to tissue death and other complications The only way to find out for sure if your injury is serious is to see a health care provider as soon as possible Particularly if your hand is grossly swollen a trip to an urgent care facility would probably be a good idea Take care This is a great question Im glad you asked In general has been found to survive as long as 4 weeks and possibly longer on various surfaces We know this because a team from Clemson University once tested the 5second rule of dropped food on the floor They found that food dropped on the floor can be contaminated with salmonella almost immediately upon contact So youre wise to be concerned with salmonella contamination from surfaces particularly the car seat because salmonella seems to like porous surfaces However bleach is an effective disinfectant against salmonella Chlorine bleach will kill salmonella pretty much instantly So as long as youve cleaned everything with bleach you probably dont have any residual salmonella contamination on the surfaces your turkey contacted In terms of frozen turkey transferring salmonella it may be possible Freezing doesnt kill necessarily kill salmonella Bacteria that survive freezing may ramp up reproduction when they thaw out So you were right to take precautions against crosscontamination even though the turkey was frozen It sounds like you did everything right However I would advise you to bleach that cloth car seat It might ruin the coloration of the fabric I know but because salmonella has been shown to thrive in nylon carpet fibers it would be good to decontaminate that car seat for the safety of your little one Hope this helps Im sorry to hear your husband is going through this It sounds very distressing for both of you Despite the negative test results Id urge you not to give up Some conditions evolve over time and may take repeated testing to identify Id suggest you make a followup appointment with your husbands primary health care provider to discuss these symptoms and how theyve progressed  or swelling of the legs and arms often is occurs when the veins arent working properly to return blood to the heart Blood pools in the veins and some of the fluid component of the blood seeps into the surrounding tissue causing swelling Very often excessive salt intake contributes to edema Your husband might consider reducing his salt intake Read food labels carefully youll be surprised how much sodium is lurking in there Smoking cigarettes also can contribute to poor circulation especially in the legs If your husband smokes Id suggest he seek medical help to quit Hope this helps I certainly think you should see a doctor about this What youre describing sounds like very hard stool that is difficult to pass This possibly could cause a eventually It sounds like youve done some good things by eating plenty of fiber and trying laxatives You should also be sure to drink plenty of fluids to stay wellhydrated Some medications for acid reflux can cause  so be aware of that Your health care provider should be able to help you figure out if you have a serious constipation issue or if theres something else going on Either way a medical professional can help you treat this and get back to having comfortable bowel movements Best wishes to you Im sorry to hear of your health woes can be nasty things to deal with I certainly hope youre under the care of a medical professional Both the lump below the jaw and the weight loss would concern me and Id suggest you visit your primary health care provider to find out whats going on A number of conditions can cause those symptoms so you need a diagnosis and possibly treatment Wishing you all the best So basically you have an itchy  Sorry all joking aside my hunch is you are experiencing a repetitive motion or due to overuse of your hands while working on the computer This symptom should not be taken lightly because repetitive motion injuries only get worse with time not better The sooner you address the underlying cause the better Youre smart to be concerned about Parkinsons disease but I want to reassure you that in Parkinsons other than in earlyonset cases Still Id suggest making an appointment with your health care provider to try to discover the underlying cause of your twitching finger If its a repetitive motion issue you can address the problem through  If its something else your doctor can help you with treatment options I wish you the best Sorry to hear this Sometimes our furry friends get a little too rambunctious Id suggest you have this checked out especially if youre running a fever The main concern is infection That swelling especially if its angry and red is a potential indicator of infection The other concern of course is whether or not the cat was properly vaccinated against rabies and the like If you were bitten by a feral cat you definitely need to get this looked at Rabies is on the decline among domesticated animals but it could happen Or the cat could have been carrying another illness it has now passed along to you Either way its not good to take chances with an animal bite I wouldnt recommend you wait for an appointment Id suggest you head for an urgent care facility or even the emergency room Take care and heal quickly Im as confused as you are I dont see how any health care provider can say a disease process doesnt exist if they havent done the appropriate testing However if your internal medicine doctor has done any blood work on you recently I would assume he or she did in fact test you for  since youd been previously diagnosed I think the key here is communication Id suggest you make another appointment with your internal medicine provider to discuss your concerns and confusion over the situation If your provider has blood test results he or she should be happy to share them with you If not you may ask again to be tested since youre symptomatic If you dont get satisfaction from this provider feel free to find another one Its important to have a primary care provider who listens to your concerns and takes time to explain the answers to your questions All the best to you Im sorry to hear youre going through this Cracked fingertips can be very painful If you havent had this checked out by a medical professional it might be worth having someone take a look just to make sure this isnt a or something that could be treated with a prescription medication Assuming this is cracking due to dry skin I would suggest applying AD ointment to your fingers You can find this preparation in the diaper rash aisle of any supermarket or drugstore Sometimes its called Vitamin A  Vitamin D ointment because thats what it contains Vitamins A and D are essential to the healing process You might see good results using this ointment or cream Rubber gloves are great for protecting your hands from harsh chemicals or from the drying effects of too much contact with water If you choose to try AD ointment I suggest you get a pair of cotton gloves such as those used for gardening or light yard work apply the ointment at bedtime then put on the gloves and go to sleep The gloves will help keep the ointment where it belongs instead of getting all over the sheets I wish you all the best with this Im sorry youre going through this and its good of you to be concerned for the health and safety of others in your household Yes as you know handwashing is key to preventing the spread of  Equally important is knowing to wash Always wash After youve gone to the bathroom Before you prepare any foods even if its only for your own consumption Use proper handwashing technique which consists of Start warm water running Get your hands wet Apply antibacterial soap Work up a good lather all the way to your wrist Rinse thoroughly this is absolutely key  Dry thoroughly Hold a towel or paper towel to turn off the water faucet Also everyone in your household should be performing frequent handwashing not just you Other ways to help protect your family members If possible dont prepare any food for the others in your household Dont share utensils spoon fork towels toothbrushes the TV remote control or anything you touch without disinfecting it first Keep food preparation areas as clean as possible You can use disinfecting wipes from the store to keep surfaces germfree Best of luck to you Im sorry to hear youre going through this If you experience this poor circulation in your hands on a regular basis youd be wise to get it checked out by a medical professional This could be the sign of an underlying condition that could be treated Meanwhile you can improve circulation to your hands by keeping them warm such as by wearing gloves indoors You also may gently shake blood down into your hands by literally swinging your arms downward in a gentle motion to push blood into your fingers My bet advice though is to have this checked out by a medical professional to make sure you dont have a heart or blood pressure issue going on Why treat the symptom if you need to be treating the cause right Best wishes to you Sorry to hear about this Its hard to tell whats going on here without doing a physical examination Depending on the size of the wound that lump could be a normal part of the healing process Or it could be an infection or hematoma collection of blood in the tissue If your brotherinlaw develops a fever over 101F as measured by a thermometer not just by feeling a forehead or guessing he should get checked out by a medical professional as this may be a sign of an infection developing Also if the wound continues to swell turns hot to the touch or oozes a green foulsmelling discharge those would all be reasons to head for urgent care Im wondering if your brotherinlaw is uptodate on his shot Every adult needs a booster injection every 10 years If your brotherinlaw doesnt know if his tetanus immunization is current he should be alert for that could develop within 2 weeks of this accident including Headache Trouble opening his mouth lockjaw Trouble swallowing Stiff neck back and shoulders Again Im sorry to hear about this accident Its a good reminder to be careful using sharp objects and also for everyone to keep their tetanus shot current Good for you for persevering Navigating the health care system can be daunting but you are hanging in there until you get some answers Obviously I cant diagnose whats going on with you and frankly wouldnt hazard a guess at this point Its possible all of your symptoms are related but its equally possible theyre all coincidental Or related to something else entirely Some conditions literally take years to reveal themselves enough for diagnosis Some examples but I want to make clear I am NOT suggesting any of these apply to you lupus gastroparesis fibromyalgia This process could be what youre experiencing If all of your symptoms are related to a single disorder perhaps that disorder is manifesting itself very slowly By not giving up and continuing to seek care for your ailments you may be helping yourself down to the road to diagnosis I wish you all the best in finding out what is causing these perplexing problems Im sorry to hear you and your loved one are going through this Its hard to help when a person cant communicate Id suggest you have your loved one checked out by a doctor Whenever an elderly person exhibits odd symptoms the first thing that comes to mind is a  While these often cause delirium in a patient as opposed to the physical actions youre describing it might be a good idea to rule out a UTI At the same time a health care provider may be able to shed some light on why your loved one is exhibiting these symptoms Perhaps shes having pain she cant communicate Its hard to tell without a physical exam and a knowledge of her medical history I wish you both all the best I wouldnt worry about this too much It doesnt sound abnormal to me Different things turn on different people Maybe oral sex just isnt your thing You can choose to analyze this and possibly discover why receiving oral sex makes you feel tense or you can choose to focus on engaging in sexual activities that give you pleasure Thats how it sizes up to me As long as youre not having other problems you can be pretty confident the lack of orgasm during oral sex is merely an issue of personal preference If you find this truly bothersome Id suggest seeking out a counselor or psychotherapist with experience in sexual dysfunction He or she should be able to help you sort this out pretty quickly All the best to you You sound like a very tough person with high pain tolerance to me It sounds like you did everything appropriately The injury didnt interfere too much with your ability to play and then you put ice on the injury afterwards You could have also applied compression like an ACE bandage for extra support but otherwise it sounds like you did a fine job treating your injury To answer your question it could indeed be a soft tissue injury Soft tissue just refers to all the nonhard tissue like bones Soft tissue injuries can be quite painful and take quite some time to heal On the other hand ha ha you could have a broken bone and not know it The wrist and hand contain a lot of bones and you definitely could have a fracture or chip without being aware of it especially since you seem to have a high pain threshold If you keep the wrist wrapped not too tight  your fingers shouldnt turn purple or anything for a few days and its still bothering you it might be worth seeing your primary care provider to rule out something more serious like a torn ligament or a broken bone It probably would be wise not to catch any games for awhile too You might have to put yourself on IR temporarily Hope this helps Tremors can be a side effect of  yes But please  Instead call the prescribing physician as soon as possible to report this side effect Your health care provider may want to reduce your dosage or change your medication Involuntary muscle movement or spasm is a known side effect of the class of medications called selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors Since there are a variety of other medications to choose from when treating depression or anxiety your health care provider can work with you to find one that doesnt cause intolerable or serious side effects I wish you all the best Unfortunately its not possible to say whats causing this without doing a physical exam and maybe some other testing It could be as simple as a muscle cramp Your best bet is to make an appointment with your primary healthcare provider to discuss the situation Please dont be embarrassed Medical professionals deal with cases like this all the time and their only concern is to make a diagnosis and get you appropriate treatment if required Hope this helps Good luck to you Im sorry youre going through this The symptoms youre describing could be caused by many conditions but a likely culprit is some sort of spinal issue Spinal degeneration is not uncommon as we age though I dont know how old you are and a ruptured disc in the neck can happen to anyone Either of these conditions can cause aching and tiredness of the limbs Id suggest you go back to the doctor to ask about these symptoms because it sounds like further testing might be warranted Blood work wont help diagnose a spinal injury or  I wish you all the best Its certainly not likely is the term we use when our bodys tissue literally freezes As you can imagine this process can take quite some time Commonly frostbite occurs when bare skin is exposed to subfreezing temperatures for a prolonged period of time The process can occur faster if the bare skin is for example engulfed in snow or ice And covered tissue like skin fingers toes etc isnt protected from frostbite either Many people have had their toes frozen by standing in kneedeep snow for hours even while wearing heavy boots Driving with the car windows down for 10 minutes in 35degree weather isnt likely to produce frostbite Even if it did it would probably only produce a very mild case involving a few skin layers Hope this answers your question First of all thank goodness you apparently dont have meningitis How scary In answer to your last question Yes I think the ER doctor should have explained to you exactly what to expect after your lumbar puncture In fact you should have received some sort of written instructions Beyond that I think they should have given you additional verbal information about what to expect due to experiencing six attempts Its possible the site is still sore because of multiple tries and because of hitting a tendon However if you begin to run a fever its time to seek medical attention Fever could be a sign of infection Lumbar punctures are performed under sterile conditions but infection can occur afterthefact I dont think four days of soreness at the puncture site is unreasonable but if youre concerned you might give your primary care provider a call It never hurts no pun intended to get these things checked out I hope you feel better soon Ouch Oh Im so sorry youre going through this The symptoms youre describing do sound like ulnar nerve pain particularly the pain to the pinky finger Thats kind of a hallmark The fact the pain is increasing not decreasing over the course of three weeks means its time for a trip to the doctor Despite the manner in which you fell its possible you broke a bone in your arm or suffered a soft tissue injury to an elbow tendon or ligament The reason to get a physical examination and maybe an Xray is to get treated earlier when the prognosis is better rather than later when the prognosis is worse While this isnt an emergency you definitely deserve to be seen by your primary care provider to diagnose what is going on and make sure you dont have any hidden fractures either in your arms or your legs I wish you all the best with this I have also had this problem before I asked my OBGYN and she said that it is normal It is a chemical that is in discharge that acts as a bleach It is most likely to happen right before your period or during ovulation Sounds like it may be Neuropathy At first you may notice numbness tingling abnormal sensations or pain in your feet Some people feel like they have socks on even though they are barefoot Over time this feeling spreads to your legs and hands Jimmy It could be diabetic nerve paindamage I imagine it probably feels like your fingers are asleep right If so I would chalk it up to nerverelated issues not anything lifethreatening but you should DEFINITELY get your diabetic doc to check it out Also do some research on the causes of numbness  tingling in the human body but be warned there are many causes but the one constant is that it is almost always caused by the nerves in our bodies Good luck FloppyChops This may be an advanced warning sign of Parkinsons If it continues through the next day or so you need to see a doctor No It does not Sometimes the infection can become systemic immediately if the scratch is deep enough And if you washed it properly you may have disinfected the skincapillary area You should keep tabs on your temperature just in case A systemic reaction can sometimes cause your temperature to go way up If it goes above 104 call a doctor Caffine will mess with absorbtion of any drug or vitamin you should wait at least one hour or more before and one hour after taking meds or eating before any caffine intake Sometimes this is the way the body releases toxins that have build up Use plenty of hand creme but a good one may help no no gout gout  I wear a 3M 8210 respirator N95 mask Have used it when I was a painter and also working on the farm in all the dust Also have sometimes put a damp kleenex inside it for further relief  I had them during my pregnancies which is a very common time to have them Im all so told rapid weight can can cause them mine have gone away for the most part just give them time and if they still bother you speak with your doctor about your options There is not a lot of information about Limbarax Keep in mind that herbal products are not regulated by the FDA leaving plenty of room for consumers to believe a product works without knowing about the ingredients warnings side effects and dosages I would be cautious about using this product I would also encourage you to seek medical attention about the lower arm tremors to make sure nothing more complicated is going on Have you been tested for Mono Im having similar if not exactly the same symptoms Sounds like the diagnosis is right My daughter had it for 2 weeks and only on gums tongue and lips Never on her hands or feet Very painful but it did go away She was 2 though HIV and STDs are generally contracted through sexual contact or exchange of bodily fluids If nothing on your body was open such a a cutthen no fluids could have come in contact with yours Even saliva transfer kissing isnt potent enough to transfer it You are safe My husbands father had them and I also worked in the medical field Yes they are  They can also cause terrible pain Im sorry hear that but what it sounds like is a common wart all you have to do is dig it out again n i know it sounds weird but throw some duck tape over it and make sure there is no oxygen getting to it eventually itll die out and no more wart Bamm Go see a chiropractor its an offer but not too many believe Have you had your neck checked out I work for a spine surgeon and we see a lot of patients with tingling in arms hands and fingers And the cause is usually cervical radiculopathy caused by problems in the vertebrea You really should not play any sport that has to do with throwing because if you put too much stress on your arm you can hurt a bone or even crack or break one So if you want to get better faster then you should get some medical attention Tell your doctor what pain you are going through and heshe should give you some type of pain killer medication If you want to help out a stressed out arm then my advice to you is that you take Tylenol Thank you for you answer please i am still stressing can an MD help me or more people elaborate on this is this true im so stressed and have so much anxiety about this She masturbated in the panties and then i handled them after i handle them

Please help Jackie Go see a doctor asap Dont panic but I suggest making an appointment to see your doctor as soon a possible The pain in your armpit and chest area sounds like Mono I know because I had it summer 2012 and i am getting it again or lymphoma daily walk 45 mins Sounds like a pinched nerveI have the same problem in my left arm Median nerves symptoms can be caused by problems from the neck all the way down to the hand In some cases there are problems with the nerve itself and with the mylien covering You really need a more complete workup to determine the cause of your median nerve neuropathy rather than at face value assume its a problem with the carpal tunnel Some patients due require rerelease of the carpal tunnel or local flap to cover the median nerve depending on the problem if the workup reveals the cause of your symtpoms localize to the carpal tunnel region First off This is a great question and there are some simple things that you should have around the house These things should include things like hydrogen peroxide alcohol swabs gauze pads Vaseline Just basically because you have to use a thermometer which is another thing that should be on that list A rectal thermometer sometimes is recommended by the pediatricians depending on the age of the baby but regular ear thermometer works just as well Things also like Neosporin or triple antibiotic ointment Saline drops to help loosing any mucous if the baby seems congested A nasal aspirator which is a device that will help you draw out the mucous out of their congested nose A vaporizer or humidifier is always handy to have as well and including things like diaper rash ointment maybe some latex gloves to have These are some necessities I think will be really important for them to have If you have a red line running from the burn on your hand past your wrist it could already be infected and I would advise that you see a health care provider as soon as possible You should not use Epsom salts for a burn or ice You can submerge the area in cool water I would also not advise putting any antibiotic ointments or dressings until a health care provider has evaluated it This all depends on how much of your hand was burned  if it is a large area you will want to be seen by a health care provider as soon as possible Do not puncture the blisters and do not put anything on the burn like butter mayonnaise or ice Even if it is a small area you will want to watch it for signs of infection which includes redness swelling continued pain and possible oozing or a wet appearance I am a little concerned about the fact that this patient called it a bad burn Based on that description my fear is that there could be a skin infection possibility and it may not be healing properly If the skin has blistered or is broken it needs to be evaluated by a physician or health care provider as soon as possible I would not recommend putting antibiotic ointment on it due to the fact that there is limited data that it evens helps  you usually need oral antibiotics to help the skin layers underneath and leave uncovered Age spots technically called solar lentigines are welldefined uniformly colored areas of brown or grayish pigment that generally appear on the hands face neck and chest Despite the name these spots are the result of prior sun exposure not age You can treat age spots several ways The most popular athome treatments are overthecounter OTC hydroquinone HQ preparations which inhibit melanin production in the skin But they tend to be more effective for treating melasma or hormonallyinduced irregular pigmentations than for true age spots Dermatologists often have better results with prescriptionstrength retinol and HQ creams which work faster than OTC formulations Dermatologists also use microdermabrasion chemical peels chemical spot treatments laser treatments and light therapy to lighten age spots Some of these procedures require just one treatment others take two or three sessions Remember to have a dermatologist check your age spots yearly to make sure they truly are benign And if you notice changes in color size shape or feel tell your skin care specialist right away  When worried about an STI its always a good idea to go see an actual live doctor fro an examination advice from chat rooms and forums is good but you want to always be SURE when talking about an STI On a separate note keeping your penis in good overall health through the use of a penis health crme with vitamins and amino acids is a good idea Good luck  Seeing a doctor is necessary for a definitive answer It may very well be a skin issue simply related to accumulation of dirt sweat etc or to a reaction to soap laundry detergent etc If that is the case one thing that may help is to regularly use a quality penis health cream health professionals recommend Man1 Man Oil after washing I had that several years ago My lymph nodes were infected had to

confused with foot hoof and mouth disease that affects cattle sheep and swine It is very hard when a loved one is no longer able to communicate her needs to her caregiver In this case you need to be sure that she is safe and not in any pain or discomfort A checkup with her doctor is the first step The doctor will need to know how long she has been upset at night and if there have been any changes to her care or surroundings that could help explain her behavior Persons who have dementia are often more confused and frightened at night or in unfamiliar surroundings After a thorough exam the doctor will be able to discuss a care plan that can help both of you This constant care and lack of sleep can put a lot of strain on the caregivers Your local Area Council on Aging or State Department

no way to know without seeing your doctor I am not able to tell what might be going on particularly since youve had quite a few tests in the past Your condition is too complicated to figure out

Aristomenis Messinias Greece Hi This first piece of info is from the UKs NHS its a bit like your Abama scheme but has been running since the end of WW2 What if I didnt have sex Its possible for you to get pregnant without having sexual intercourse penetration if for example sperm get into your vagina  for example if you or your partner have semen or preejaculate on your fingers and touch your vagina your partner ejaculates near your vagina your partners erect penis comes into contact with your body near your vagina The risk of getting pregnant in this way is very low because sperm can only live for a short time outside of the body However if youre not planning a pregnancy its important to know that its possible to get pregnant in this way By the way are you natural with pubic hair or shaved Dr Hector Chapa answered If sperm gets around the outside of the vagina how likely is it to get pregnant Not likely For conception to occur several finely tuned processes must occur all in perfect order First of which is cervical bathingcoating by sperm The reason this is needed is because of all the volume deposited at the cervix some will leak out some will never enter the cervix some will die in the uterine cavity Sperm deposited on the exterior of the vagina cant migrate into the vaginal canal Dr Tony T Ho answered My semen came into contact outside of her vagina by my penis i didnt release sperm thereShe also has sist in her overyCould she get pregnant Always possible Any time there is contact of semen to a womans genital vault there is the possibility of pregnancy It doesnt sound like its very likely in this situation but you wont get a no its not possible here Have her do a pregnancy test in 2 weeks to be sure Dr Ravi D Chauhan answered If sperm gets on or around my vagina can I get pregnant Yes In a fertile woman any contact of sperm with the vaginal tissues can result in conception Hi First go have a look on wwwearthcliniccom your find loads of natural help

infection I had this about 14 years ago you need to get in a hospital daily for around 2 weeks yes its that bad Do hope this helps you Good Luck Hi I think the thing to do is wait to see if your period dose come at the right time if not then do an HPT or a pregnancy test at your doctors Brown blood means its old blood See how it goes Good Luck And last sorry could not post all this in one go Can you get pregnant from sperm outside your body If a man ejaculates around the labia of a womans vagina the tail like whip of the sperm may guide it to the inside of a womans vagina  The mission of each sperm is to reach the unfertilized egg and it has no problem with heading in the right direction if the travel occurs quickly it can get inside where it can live up to two weeks in the womans uterus before inpregnation no once sperm touches oxygen or air it is killed think of it as bacteria it dies when its not at body temperature The two answers above are both false First of all sperm are very fragile and they are not on a mission to reach a womans egg Truth be told experiment after experiment has shown that sperm have no sense of direction and cant swim very well Thus the reason that millions of sperm must be present and ejaculated INSIDE a woman so that maybe a handful can reach an egg if present Also sperm dont die when they hit the air they only die once the semen dies If you dont know semen is the liquid you can see that contains the sperm which you cant see If the semen is dry the sperm are dead Think about this even under perfect conditions where both people are fertile and healthy the woman is perfectly ovulating and the man ejaculates directly into her vagina the chances of pregnancy are never more than 80 So if under perfect conditions it is still relatively difficult to get pregnant than it is nearly impossible to get pregnant in any other fashion Put it this way there has never been a case other than the birth of Jesus son of Mary where a virgin gets pregnant So in the real world a man cant just ejaculate on a woman and get her pregnant the two must have sex It is impossible to keep your virginity and get pregnant because sperm must be inside a woman for her to get pregnant and this cant happen if there is no intercourse If a man ejaculates on a womans stomach face breasts etc there is no chance of pregnancy because the sperm cant just waltz into a womans vagina Many women may say that they didnt have sex and yet got pregnant but this is not the case Knowledge is power So there you are there all from different sites Some doctors and some not but you do have to remember that sperm when ejaculated inside the vagina is there at your cervix now just add all the way it has to travel through thick mucus and then it has to break into the cervix its a long way to go I know its there job and add into that its only a small amount of sperm it would not be the full load So lots to have read and think about But why not give it a try or trial to see if can be done But please let us know how you got on Do hope this helps you Good Luck Hi If its not bleeding you should be ok just give it a god warm water sea salt wash this is great at

shouldnt last too long But if the pain continues I would see a doctor to see if you need an xray Ive experience that feeling and its usually because I didnt eat enough during the day before my workout and I pushed myelf too hard If you are overexherting yourself then it could be that you have low blood sugar and it is causing your dizziness and making you feel light headed If you are not eating enough during the day before a strenusous workout this could be a side effect I would try to eat a healthy meal that contains a good balance of proteincarbsnutrients try something like a chicken breast and a small sweet potato and maybe a small dinner roll Give your food some time to settle an hour or two then during your workout try to sip on a gatorade or Vitamin water Try not to over do it

is caused by something other than a sedentary lifestyle try to overexert yourself really try to analyze yourself a little more keep a food journal catalog everything you eat in a day serving sizes and include annotations about how youre feeling on each day and your energy levels change your diet start eating more fiber 24 grams per day sunflower seeds are great for fiber and you dont want to eat

next best thing to do is just treat her for hives with something that worksand something that she can take every day No Hand foot and mouth disease is a virus most likely acquired at school or where other children congregate It is not from unsanitary conditions or exposure to animal excrementurine I think it would be highly unlikely that you could get pregnant in this manner however if you are not on an effective birth control or your partner does not use a condom there are many other ways this could happen If you dont get your period you should take a pregnancy test in a week or so There is an excellent prescription for this called DrySol This condition is called hyperhidrosis In severe cases there is even a surgery to fix this problem expense solution however It would not be prudent or even possible to determine if someone was experiencing a stroke blindly over the Internet Strokes are unilateral one sided and severe daily foot or leg cramping are not signs one would experience These symptoms could indicate vascular problems or even neurological disorders however so they deserve a complete evaluation by your medical provider Expect some diagnostic tests including blood tests  and perhaps a low back xray or Doppler imaging studies of your lower extremities if your medical provider feels these tests are necessary Never underestimate the wisdom of your bodies to give us warning signs so please do not ignore these symptoms No this is not a sign of bruising but it may be a sign of contact reaction Since the redness and swelling has occurred in both hands at the same time there is a possibility that he picked up more than just a sand bag If he picked up or handled cement this is an entirely different problem Cement does cause the hands to become red and irritated Did he put his handprint into some fresh cement I think you need to do a little more investigation of a nineyear old boys day It is just not your bottom that has germsin a bathroom there are diseascausing germs on every surface the countertops toilet seat handles etc While an extremely agile and careful person may not touch their genitals or anal area they do touch surfaces Contaminated hands spread germs to other surfaces and other people Washing hands is the most important and basic of all hygiene practices Only a fool would not wash their hands If you are not improving in a day or so you may need to see a medical provider for an examination Medical providers are bound by confidentiality so please dont worry that your secret will be revealed to a parent Just insist on being in the exam room alone and then disclose how this happened What you tell a parent is really up to you In the meantime spend some time sitting in a hot bathtuband keep fingers and other objects out of your vagina until you have healed If it is not onesided as you mentioned it is something else other than shingles but unfortunately without the ability to see it firsthand during an examination I would not be able to narrow down the many possibilities for you based solely on your description You would need to see a medical provider so you can have these skin lesions properly diagnosed The only way to know conclusively if you broke your thumb is to have an xray There is really no way of knowing The stage of a cancer cannot be determine by feeling it I am so sorry to hear about your father It may not be in your hand This could be a tattoo created by the graphite that appears like a piece of the pencil If you did have a foreign body like a piece of the pencil it should have become infected a long time ago If you did have a retained foreign body the biggest risk would be infection but clearly this has not happened There would be no health consequences if this black area was just a residual tattoo You dont get tinea PEDIS on your hands pedis means feet Tinea pedis or Athletes feet is a fungus and treated with an antifungal There are many good ones available over the counter It would be uncommon to have this on the hands so there are other forms of dermatitis that should be considered The diagnosis is the key so if you are diagnosing your child I would suggest that you see a medical provider to make sure before blindly treating a skin eruption The removal of pubic hair is not medicallybeneficial in any way nor does it protect you from pubic lice The removal of pubic hair is only a cosmetic fad Yes Thats a bit like going to have your appendix removed before you have appendicitis It is sooo much easier and more effective to PREVENT an unintentional pregnancy that to take a hormone like Plan B Remember that preventing conception is just one part of this equation You also need STD prevention and Plan B will not to that What should be done before hand is for the woman to be one an oral contraceptive or another effective form of contraception AND insist that her partner use a condom 100 of the time If Plan B was the answer then it would be called Plan A Your description is really not sufficient for me to even make a wild guess I dont know your babys age or the location of these lumps and obviously I have no way of feelingexamining them to give you a definitive answer Any chance that they are related to the vaccine administrations on the upper thigh area Children often bleed a tiny bit under the skin from the injection This area can form a tiny innocent lump that can take a while to selfresolve I have no way of assessing the severity of your injury over the Internet nor predict if you will get a subsequent injury In order to get those answers you would need to be examined firsthand no pun intended by a medical professional and perhaps have an xray of your hand to rule out a subtle fracture I have no way of making a comment on your husbands fidelity but I can tell you that molluscum lesions can be contracted in other ways by direct skintoskin contact It does not have to be sexual contact I see these quite often in schoolage children most likely acquired by one of their playmates You could have contracted them from one of your patients Either one is finethis is a personal choice A healthy vagina is no more contaminated than a healthy mouth It is a good idea to wash your hands before and after tampon insertion Unfortunately there is really no way to predict a 100 success after a surgery I do not have the facts related to your tear or your medical history but rotator cuff surgeries can be tricky Some people have wonderful outcomes others do not Personally I have had two surgeries about six months apart on my left shoulder and it failed Not wanting to have a third surgery I am currently just living with it Like you my right shoulder is now causing me some pain I am older than you Have a heart to hear talk with your surgeon While many will be very optimistic about your outcome even the best surgeons will never predict a 100 positive outcome As a patient you need to carefully weigh the pros and cons with your surgeon Surgeons love to do surgery and they all claim they are the best but dont hesitate to get a second opinion Asks lots of questions especially about the technique they will be using Older surgeons often do old surgeries and may not offer you the latest technology Younger surgeons may know the latest techniques for surgical repairs but may not have the experience In the end YOU are the one that must give the go ahead Nothat is not a definitive sign Although a single transverse crease does appear with Down Syndrome it is not the only sign of this genetic disorder nor does it mean that you are prone to have a child with Down Syndrome Wash you hands with running water cold or hotdoes not really make a difference and use SOAP The detergent breaks up the natural oils on the skin that trap dirt and dirt particles and will help the water wash it off I would be more concerned with you BREATHING in lead dust There are no oral medicines that are routinely used to treat common warts although some people have tried the cimetidine Tagomet but this is certainly an offlabel use with mixed results Personally I have never used it My suggestion would be for him to see a good dermatologistsomeone who can work with him closely trying different highend treatments until a cure is orchestrated He has definitely tried lots of things but I have never met a wart that I couldnt eventually kill with persistent treatments I use liquid nitrogen most of the time but there are more topical prescription treatments that can be used if the dermatologist feels it is appropriate The pregnancy risk is very smallbut not zero While I commend your attempts to limit your sexual activity to mutual masturbation you have a responsibility to keep viable semen away from your female partners genital area There is always a possibility of a fracture when you have a crush injury The only way you will be sure is to have it xrayed If you dont have any fracturesgreat but if you do it is going to require a different treatment plan The sooner you know FOR SURE the better I do not believe there are ANY labs that could detect a trace amount of any spider venom seven years after a bite nor that I can believe a venomous spider bite would still be causing lymph node reaction now I would strongly recommend that you see a medical provider and have these nodes properly examined there can be MANY reasons and perhaps have a few diagnostic tests I dont knowI cant see it as you know In order to have this traveling black dot properly assessed you will need to see a medical provider  someone who can perform a handson examination Of course Many fractures go undetected so you will need to see your medical provider and have an xray By this time you may see xray evidence of an OLD fracture but the fact that you are still having pain indicates a need for a good examination to find the reason There are no set times for using Epsom salts for this purpose As a matter of fact I have never recommended it What concerns me is the redness and swelling which can be signs of infection especially when it was an animal bite I recommend that you call your medical provider or the place that sutured your hand for patientspecific advice As you know I have no way of seeing or examining your injury over the Internet It would be highly unlikely to cause a pregnancy in the way you described There can be many other reasons for cramps or a change in the menstrual cycle other than pregnancy See your gynecologist to make sure there is not an underlying structrual or anatomical issue like a retroverted tilted uterus etc Unless your sexual partner is a trained psychotherapist he should not be diagnosing you with an emotional problem or implicate a trust issue Most of these issues can be solved but more information is needed No Warts are caused by a HUMAN papilloma virus Dogs cannot get human warts so he is safe to pet them or get licked as much as he wants It would not be possible to adequately assess your daughter based on Internet posting As a concerned parent of an adult child the only thing you can do is try to get her some help with a psychologist or psychiatrist as a first step You cant make her go but you can be assertive in your suggestion Nothis would not likely be harmful assuming your girlfriend does not have any bloodborne diseases like hepatitis Sucking blood really not a safe practiceeven for vampires so I would caution you from doing this again unless of course you ARE a vampire A crush injury can cause some considerable softtissue damage and that may not be evident on a plain xray or even on an examination Yes fractures can be missed by the person reading them and the radiologist so repeat xrays are often ordered However if your injury was severe and you are having that array of symptoms seeing an orthopedist or a handspecialist may be a logical next step At has only been three days so things may still settle down with cold compresses and antiinflammatory medications but there is nothing inappropriate in arranging an orthopedic consultation for next week Not even close Hand foot and mouth disease is totally different than rubella German Measles You are most likely vaccinated and immune to rubella but there is no vaccine for HFM disease A BP of 16595 is still too high and it puts you at risk While some people can tolerate higher pressures than others that does not make it acceptable It is definitely better than 200140 though Lowering blood pressure can be done many ways using many different types of medications and combinations The goal for any clinician would be to use the least amount of medication with little or no adverse effects to control the pressure into NORMAL range It would be great to have the top number your systolic pressure below 138 and that bottom number the diastolic pressure below 88 Yes some BP meds can make you tiredsleepy or even contribute to your cold handsfeet so try to work with your doctor until you can find the right combination Hopefully you have a blood pressure machine at home and are taking your own BPs on a regular basis Nothing is wrong We both know that you have plenty of bloodit is just a problem trying to get it out The skill of the phlebotomist may be in question Using a smaller butterfly needle may have solved the problem Some veins are smaller and more elusive so going to a larger vein in the arm should have been easy if your arm is not too large Veins are typically palpated felt rather than viewed when it comes to drawing blood If the tourniquet was not on tight enough or long enough the vein may not have distended If all fails many phelbotomists will put a warm compress on your arm and allow it to dangle down a bit Unless your company is willing to get you a fullhead respiratory system there is really no simple mask system I am absolutely appalled that you have to inhale secondary smoke at your place of employment NO ONE should be smoking around youperiod If they cannot provide you with a smokefree environment while you are pregnant then they should be required to pay your FULL salary for you to stay home I think it is time for you to call the labor board and complain Do you work in the United States You will not catch Chlamydia that wayso relax You and your girlfriend are safe and your roomate is under treatment There is nothing wrong with spraying a little Lysol on those contaminated surfaces like toilet seats though Rubbing alcohol quickly evaporates and will not penetrate intact skin You will be just finenothing bad will happen Assuming you have the medical skills to examine someones hands to rule out a herpetic lesion herpetic whitlow keep in mind that a person can shed the herpes viruses like from shingles etc when an active lesion is not obvious No but carrots and sweet potatoes can do it carotene I cant tell you if these are warts or notyour description is not the same as a firsthand examination They could be common warts or even molluscum but I would need to see it Since I cannot you need to see her medical provider for a definitive diagnosis and recommend treatment Warts if these are warts are caused by human papilloma viruses not vitamin deficiency Giving her vitamins will not help Hives do not spread when you scratch them although there are types of hives that can be caused by skin pressure Most of the time hives are caused by something you have eating breathed or touched I knowhundreds of possibilities and will respond to oral antihistamines  Yesa prescription for DrySol Ask your medical provider As you know I have no way of examining these mysterious red blisters over the Internet so I am at a disadvantage Hand Foot and Mouth disease will give whitish papules look like tiny blisters but are more firm on the PALMS of the hands SOLES of the feet and cankersore like lesions inside the mouth  What you are describing would not be consistent with Hand Foot and Mouth disease The odds of an unintentional pregnancy would be very very low There is really nothing topical in the form of a cream that will help the skin lesion discomfort There is an analgesic syrup for the inside of the mouth viscous lidocaine by prescription that you can swab if her medical provider prescribes it Ibuprofen helps with the lesions on the skin unless her pediatrician gives her a codeinecontaining pain medication No you cannot get AIDS from selfmasturbating This is considered very safe sex Noshe can suck her thumb Hand foot and mouth disease can affect those three parts equally and even the diaper area so sucking her thumb will not spead the infection or make it worse It would be highly unlikely for her to get pregnant in the way you described assuming you are telling the whole story You and your girlfriend are playing with fire so to speak If you keep up with this risky sexplay that tends to escalate over time there could be an unintentional pregnancy in your future If you are sexually involved it is time for you BOTH to get serious about contraception Why not use a condom when you are playing around Should your sexual practice progress and they usually do make sure that she is also using an effective contraceptive as well The only surefire contraception is abstinence and you are definitely not practicing that so be smart Some clinicians are just more gentle than others For women I would suggest a female provider MD PA or nurse practitioner Not that men cannot be gentle I am a man but a woman provider should be much more sympathetic to your concerns Make the appointment and then call them personally a day or so before your exam to discuss your concerns Knowing that you have had a bad experience in the past should make them more understanding take their time and make this important exam lessstressful for you A small amount of bleeding can be expected with a pap sometimes but certainly the clinician can be a bit more gentle with the bimanual examination when feeling your uterus cervix and ovarian areas I dont know the details of your case not all fractures are the same to be able to determine if pain is appropriate four weeks after casting but my guess would be NOit is not normal You need to see your orthopedist again for a reevaluation Sometimes improperly placed casts can cause painful pressure areas or your fracture may have shifted Washing up after sex will not wash away any semen that is deposited and entrapped in the cervical mucous  these are the sperm that have a chance of impregnation Advice is mixed about lying on your back or with a pillow under your buttocks to encourage gravity to help but it is fine to do so dont jump up and rush to the shower I dont believe the contracting your vaginal muscles will help that much for increasing your chances of conception but doing these Kegeltype exercises has some other advantages Having an intense orgasm during intercourse will help so remind your partner to be generous and considerate I never heard of a case where an STD was contracted from a bottle of old urine I think you are safe even if you recently had an open wound on your hand Needless to say I assume that you wash your hands thoroughly after this exposure As long as you are not showing any signs of a skin infection around this wound you are in the clear Urine is typically sterile unless the person has a urinary tract infection but I still would not want to have this old pee on my hands You are wise to be concerned but it would not be likely you can catch any disease from this exposure Even if you did get a minor wound infection it would not be an STD The vaginal and urethral areas are rich in blood supply just like the inside of your nose It doesnt take much irritation to make these mucosal areas bleed but it would be nice if you or your medical provider can find the source Sometimes the tiniest of little tears can bleed Some urinary tract infections will present initially as bleeding so having a urinalysis would be good to make sure you do not have an infection Use an alcoholbased hand sanitizer Here is some basic information to start including some wonderful reference sites httpwwwwebmdcombrainpostpoliosyndrome Every person with PPS is different so there risks would also be unique to them You are having various connective tissue problems like a torn rotator cuff but as you know this can happen to people who do not have PPS myself included When having surgery it would be good for your doctor to be familiar with PPS or you may have to educate him Based on your vague description cellulitis would be low on the possibility list The penis is covered by skin and the skin can have multiple pimplelike bumps Unfortunately the only way you can get a definitive answer is to see a medical provider for an exam A description or even a picture just doesnt do it when it comes to determining a diagnosis and to suggest a treatment regime As you may know the Internet has some obvious limitations that cannot be circumvented Nothing really causes poor hygiene per seit is a choice unfortunately Your nephew can easily change but chooses not to You could have a hearttoheart talk to him again but a decision to improve his hygiene habits may still be ignored If he had a significant other they may have the influence but as an Aunt you can only do so much Like any bad habits his lack of personal hygiene may be difficult to changeunless HE decides to do it Yes I am sure you can find an orthopedic hand surgeon willing to do take a crack at it no pun intended but you could be asking for more trouble than it is worth In order to get a better cosmetic result it will require a rebreak and perhaps a pinning of the metacarpal in order to straighten out the bent digit The orthopedist will tell you the pros and cons and hopefully your insurance company will be agreeable to paying for it No dont worry about the paint In most cases the only paint that would even be a minor issue would be leadbased paint I suspect you were using latex or oilbased paint If it was dried this is not going to create risk your wife but for Goodness Sake wash your hands next time before you get amorous No woman wants a painted hand caressing them It would not be possible to accurately diagnose a dermatological skin condition by description photograph or not If this problem has been troubling you for 57 years it is time for you to see a good dermatologist when your hand is actively peeling Possibilities include chemical dermatitis contact with certain chemicals soaps detergents etc in your environment to dyshydrotic eczema often called dishpan hands common in people who exposed their hands to water or wash them often Eczema may fit the bill based on your description but a handson no pun intended examination would be best It is not possible to make a blind diagnosis of a dermatological problem I would need to examine your son which obviously I cannot Impetigo is a Staph Strep infection MRSA is a specific type of Staph infection Both can cause those symptoms and both would require a wound culture to make the diagnostic distinction If he is worried about MRSA the culture is essential Bactrim and Bactroban would treat Staph infection but Strep one cause of impetigo would not be improved by Bactrim Send him to Student Health or an Urgent Care facility so he can be examined tested and treated I dont know that AGE of your son but stomatitis is only in the mouth but if he is also having blisterlike lesions appearing on his hands and the bottom of his feet I would be highly suspicious that he has Hand Foot and Mouth disease a coxsakie virus infection Valtrex will not help a rash related to mononucleosis There are THOUSANDS of medical conditions that can result in a rash so it would not be wise to associate your sons mono with your rash The rash seen in mono does not usually itch Since I cannot see your rash and examine you over the Internet I would advise you to see a medical provider so you can be properly diagnosed If you suspect that the injury was capable of breaking a bone then yes An xray is really the only way to conclusively determine if you have a fracture or not Without the ability to examine you hand firsthand this is really the best advise I can offer A description is really not sufficient to make that call In my opinion that is NOT okay Having taught this exam for over four decades to medical students this is NOT the way this exam should be doneever The doctors technique is highly unusual inappropriate and has strong sexual implications It would be extremely unlikely if not impossible for you to become pregnant from the scenario that you have described but if you and your boyfriend are already experimenting in sexual play it may only be a matter of time before one or your activities sexual exploits progresses to a point where you will face a real risk of an unwanted pregnancy It is not likely that your granddaughter has shingles on BOTH of her hands Shingles follows a nerve pathway and occurs just on one side of the body like the face chest or back Shingles is caused by the herpes virus the same virus that causes fever blisters cold sores and chicken pox Shingles does not occur on both hands so that blisterlike rash needs to be properly diagnosed It could be a form of eczema impetigo handfootmouth disease or any number of skin conditions that can occur on the hands Check the bottoms of her feet and inside her mouthif you see similar lesions it may be hand foot and mouth disease  A search of WebMD will provide you with more information on this curious childhood illness Remember that just exposure to an infectious disease yes shingles is contagious does not necessarily mean the exposed person will get it It depends on what you have been doing prior to these incidents There are numerous causes but one that I experience daily is after an intense workout especially a whole body workout The adrenalin and nitric oxide produced gives what some people term runners high and it usually lasts 30  40 minutes after a workout  depending on the intensity My arthritis took 5 years before it showed up on an Xray My one hand hurt despite no proof and the doctor gave me Meloxicam 15 Mg Tab to take because I also have arthritis in my left knee I take it at night only Xrays dont necessarily work to the depth we expect them to in my opinion But my doctor knows this I suffered from extreme anemia as well You may want to talk to her doctor about the iron infusions Those really are of more help than the actual iron supplement Sounds like you hit your funny bone More than one funny bone in the body The arm  hand are so connected or maybe you might have put some undo pressure on a nerve on your arm or shoulder At 39 get use to having changing in our lives though interesting makes life a challenge Not yet middle age but stop moaning when you stand or can you still stand on your head Enjoy life and exercise more Its life Cory what could you possibly think it was Brain tumor What is more interesting is that you took time to post the injury and the doctor says what There is surgery and therapy have you done all that is necessary My best to you Not enough information Age might help Thats absolutely normal Its your scar tissue causing that feel and appearance Wide exhale as you sit up keep going X hell X heal oh yes were up angora dominoes almost there but just doing 17 the use 3 to one now walk your legs Bob allowed the ball to roll you up

knees up OVA over keep it going why onesided deal because crunching the other side the structuring over exhale and those needs on should be feeling a bit tired now almost there and thanks 5 poll 3 to Juan down with the ball Go see a specialist sounds serious to me your blood glucose levels are bouncing around better safe than sorry If this is a new condition it could be a contact dermatitis This means that your skin is reacting to something it has come into contact with that has irritated that portion of your skin While it might not be poison ivy you could have a sensitivity to something else See if you can go back and figure out what might have set off this skin condition In the meantime keep it clean and dry Apply a small amount of over the counter cortisone cream to see if that helps the itching Your first step is to exclude any underlying medical causes such as a thyroid condition connective tissue disease or an infectious process When you wash your hands avoid cleansers that contain alcohol This will further dry your hands Your next step is to focus on moisturizing and hydrating your hands There are several pigmented skin problems caused by hormones Age spots are very common And youre correct they are caused by sun exposure There are several agents that lighten them including licorice extract niacin hydroquinone and others Its very important during and after the use of a brightening agent to apply sunblock or the spots will return Did you ever figure it out I am a RN and am having the same problem doctors tell me to take Benadryl which makes it difficult to work efficiently as I am exhausted when taking this medication I have not yet seen a dermatologist but would like to know what you found out This sounds like a pinched nerve or possibly nerve damage CATMRI will be required for diagnosis  Yes it does actually We men also feel a loss of interestis this the same as loss of libido At 65Andafter 28 yrs of marriageeven I feel a fear of failure when the

Staff There are devices now available that improve holding your cell phone tablet or ebook readers Check out handablecom Discipline means different things to each individual As a child my definition of discipline involved either a spanking timeout or a combination of the two However modern definition of discipline is not so much about punishment but instilling values At 9 months a child can easily be trained on his or her behaviour Consider any of the following tactics from Dr Sears 1 Guide little hands Exploring hands are always looking for things to handle so give the young explorer word associations to help him sort out what he or she may touch Try yes touch for safe things no touch for objects offlimits and soft touch for faces and animals To tame the impulsive grabber try encouraging the one finger touch other words eg hot touch owie touch will come to mind as you discover the world of touch together 2 Respect little grabbers For a young toddler make eye contact and divert his or her attention to something else he or she would like For an older toddler tell her youll help her get what she wants This is simply an exercise in politeness and respect an adultin charge approach Children need adults to communicate and model the behavior adults expect 3 Distract and divert When your child begins acting up get his attention by calling his name or some other cue word that you have learned will stop him in his tracks long enough to distract him Then quickly divert him toward a safer alternative 4 Offer redirectors A babys mind is filled with hundreds of word associations Try creating verbal cues that the child will interpret as safe behaviour For instance try using the word go to let the child know it is time to go outside and play Later when he initiates bad behaviour you can say the word go and he will be distracted by the thought of going out to play 5 Set Limits Much of your discipline depends upon your ability to set limits Humans need limits and the younger the child the more defined should be the limits Boundaries provide security for the child whose adventurous spirit leads him to explore but his inexperience may lead him astray Limitsetting teaches a valuable lesson for life the world is full of yeses and nos You decide what behavior you cannot allow and stick to that limit This will be different for each family and each stage of development Setting limits introduces a new level of frustration which every child must experience on the homefront before he is hit with it in the world outside the door You set the limits by making him stop misbehaving and teach him to play nicely 6 Take Charge We want to clearly be in charge of our toddlers so that they feel safe and secure with someone standing between them and the dangers of the big world with a place to go for help We dont want to control them like puppets so that we feel powerful First let them know by your tone of voice and our actions that you are mature adults Second by being available as a safe and secure homebase they can leave and return to you at will for comfort and reassurance In this way we could help them develop their own inner controls 7 Provide structure When your child reaches one year of age another title is added to the parenting job description architect of your childs environment By taking on this job you steer the childs energies toward enjoyable learning experiences and away from harm You create structure which does not mean being inflexible repressive or domineering What we mean by structure is setting the conditions that encourage desirable behavior to happen Structure protects and redirects You free the child to be a child and provide the opportunity to grow and mature Structure creates a positive environment for the child By a bit of preplanning you remove most of the nos so that a generally yes environment prevails You can view a more indepth example of Dr Sears discipline tools visit httpwwwaskdrsearscomtopicsdisciplinebehavior8toolstoddlerdiscipline yes there is tingling in my finger tips and when I go to bed at night in morning it wake me up hurting bad  Hi   I am also 32 yrs old I have been suffering with depression and Anxietyattacks for about 14 years I have always been the person that sits in the back of a crowd not wanting to socialize I would rather have someone approach to say hi I can never get the courage to do it on my own I find that it really helps to have a friend or someone that you know next to you Thats probably hard in meetings I would suggest to try and put all of your thoughts in whats happening in the meeting If you have to listen to someone talking concentrate only on that person and what they are saying That is what I did in class I tried to make it feel like I was the only one in there and the teacher co worker boss or whatever was only talking to me I really hope that some of this advise works I wish you the best   i have not experienced what you are going through but i did have anal fissures leading to bleeding also hard stools here is what worked for me i have boiled okra regularly for dinner as part of my diet spinach indian recipie for Plain palak 1 Apple a day Dried prunes in office for munching about 5 to 6 ATLEAST two Liters of water every day almond oil with warmor hot for me milk after dinner and important walking 30 mins a day if possible before the first visit to the toilet int he morning i never buy ebooks but i bought this one and some of them helped me httpwwwusfreeadscom2455300clshtml ebook pdf is called constipation help Im not saying this will cure your condition which looks a bit further away from where i was but these things in my diet helped me from what i experienced once you have this situation its better to see what foods you eat and make a regular schedule disclaimer i only told what i faced and how it helped me im not a docotr and have no medical knowledge i also cut out coffee entirely from my diet hotchoclate Thank you I will check it out My doctor said it is essential tremors The shaking in my hands is not at rest as in Parkinsons HIV HORMONE LEVELS CHANGE DURRING YOUR PERIOD OR RIGHT BEFORE YOUR PERIOD DROP CAUSES THOSE ISSUES BUT HORMONES DURRING OVULATION TIME RAISES YOUR SEXUALL DRIVE ITS PART OF HUMAN NATURE TO REPRODUCE SO THANK GOD FOR HORMONES AND ALL THE LITTLE BABIES THAT WE CREATE AND AS WOMAN WE GET TO CARRY FOR 10 MONTHS WICH MOST PEOPLE THINK IS 9 MONTHS YA FOR HUMAN NATURE AND OVULATION AND HORMONES  BEING STRESSED ABOUT IT TRY TALKING TO A DR ABOUT STERIOD SHOTS IN YOUR HANDS IT MAY HELP do you use bleach alot Dumb questionask the doctor that prescribed the med or ask a pharamist I also have this problemn cant figure it outI take Zyrtec every couple daysthat helpsthen a day or two later its backnot know what n why bothers me as much as the itchinghope someone figures it out It sounds infected to me I would try to get to a doctor but in the meantime I would put a topical antibiotic on it like bacitracin or something I hope it feels better soon Its my understanding that a shake is really just involuntary muscle movements There are lots of things that can make you shake from anxiety to dehydration the use of stimulants from coffee to things more harmful to low blood sugar You might want to rule certain things out so I would go to my doctor Hope this helps I have never heard of this I always thought that shingles and chicken pox were from the same virus but have never heard of this connection I read your question and while I dont know what to tell you to do exactly I can tell you that a medical professional will not be shocked by anything you have done They have to keep things confidential so dont worry about that part of it either Plus its their job  they are there for things like this Before you start self medicating I would see a doctor and not wait I know there are a lot of topical medications that shouldnt be put in sensitive areas so I would really be hesitant to treat without a doctors care Also the faster you go the faster you will feel better and your anxiety over it will be lifted First I will say that you should consult your doctor However soaking your feet in epson salt might help you any other symptoms you could have a pinched nerve or carpal tunnel syndrome or possible another form of arthritis I had the same thing and I was diagnosed w RA if it was me I would go to your doc  tell all the symptoms  get things checked out good luck the human mouth is a very nasty place no matter how many times we brush millions of germs can be transmitted through a human bite put peroxide on it daily  some antibiotic cream cover with a bandage watch for any pus or any signs of infection also you should be up to date on your tetnus shot since that can open another can of worms if infection occurs or you do need the tetnus shot see your doc I am SO sorrybut I could not resist saying this I have NO idea how old you are or anything else about you of courseBUT your spelling is just really bad I just wondered why I guess And I wish I could help you with it Warm wishes Marty lilpond every nite when i wake up my hands are numb Sounds like you are allergic Take benadril right away If swelling continues or your throat starts closing go to ER right away Some soiders can cause deadly bites Did you keep the spider I get the same thing it is the osteoarthritis in my cervical neck that is pinching on the nerve thru my arm I also have carpet tunnel syndrome with this and that can hurt the entire arm as well my hands go weak the arm muscles and I get tingling and numbness at times therapy and shots in my spine did not work sometimes I will put on my wrist splints when it gets bad stop what im doing and sit for a while till it subsidestake many breaks thru the day The stuff in your face is probably the cervical neck osteo pinching and herniated discs that may be in there and you probably have TMJD with your jaw I wear a jaw splint for that too or I have gone to chiropractors and done exercise for the neck and jaw I also take Cyclobenzaprine for jaw and neck pain and my fibromyalgia and it works wonders or I take Ibuprofen too if the other drug isnt enough for the pain I try ice and heat too As long as you clean off the keyboard and make sure to get the sticky stuff between the keys you should be just peachy keen my kids were all like this some kids are just more sensitive to sound than others but its always wise to get their ears checked by a physician you may have a rib out u could just need your back popped yes of course they could n yes they would more than likely have to be removed if i were u i would be rushing to the er Unprotected sex is a risk in its self not only due to the risk of pregnancy but STDs as well My advice to you would be to use this scare as a lesson Always be protected no matter what the guy says Its your body and your choice and above all be safe Get an xray of your hand From my own experience it never did with me the six years prior to my rt leg and left foot amputationTake care of your feet though do you have a history of neck problems Do you have any history of heart problems or high blood pressure or cholesterol Compare your symptoms with cervical neuropathy and for cardiac arrest I think it has more to do with your neck but you didnt give much info and I want to make sure you check cardiac issuesjust in case Only YOUR body can cause an allergic reaction Your body is reacting to something it views as a threat or invader A bite cant cause an allergy but it can cause your body to have a reaction The prior bite is probably unrelated to your symptoms Especially since it happened 3 months ago and youre still having issues Keep in mind that you can develop an allergy at any point Example Perhaps you drink Orange Juice every day3 times a day You can even develope an allergy in the same day Imagine drinking the first and second glass of OJ and be just fine Then you could drink the third glass and have a reaction Because of your eye symptoms it makes me think its more likely youre allergic to something in the air Im sure youve heard of hayfever However latex allergies can be very dangerous Lets say you have a SEVERE reaction and need to go to the Emergency Room Guess what The Drs and nurses will be touching you with latex gloves which would make it worse You need to be tested to find out your allergen What it is thats causing your bodys reaction You can have your doctor test you or even use one of the home allergy tests they have on the market now have you tried the symptom checker nerve damage to your hand well it could be ticks  talk to your doctor about it no I have this problem also all the time for years now and take Furosemide and Hydrochlorothiazide for this but I am also having to really lower my intake of sodium and get a lot more exercise Too much salt and not getting enough exercise WILL cause swelling and numbness and tingly sensation in feet ankles legs face hands and fingers Also a pinched nerve in the neck andor lower back will cause this as well I cannot sleep on my back without waking up with my face eyes hands and fingers swollen numb and tingling and this is because I have had 3 herniated disks in my neck and even with epidural shots in the disks to take the swelling off the nerves the pressure of sleeping on my back causes the disks to press against the nerves which will cause all the swelling and numbness The major thing though is the salt intake amount and lack of exercise When I cut out the salt and move around more by cleaning house gardening mowing the lawn get on my exercise bike and work at the restaurant and try not to stay on my back at night when sleeping the swelling and fluid retention is reduced tremendously Also drinking at least 10 16 ounce glasses of water everyday is a big help towards this My prescription water pills which are also BP meds plus all that drinking of water everyday usually will knock out all that swelling and numbness I hope this helps you because I know how uncomfortable and miserable all this swelling makes you feel No you need at least 4 weeks to heal After surgery you cant use your hand without signifigant pain bending  using fingers is difficult you will be helpless if you dont have a hand to do every day things like wiping after using the toilet I had both hands done 3 weeks apart  returned to work 3 weeks laterhad to take an additional 3 weeks off Give it plenty of time to heal The Dr told me 6 weeks is needed Spider bite I dont know about your hands and feet but have your doctors checked your tonsils and adenoids If you still have them they might be causing your sore throat I had a similar problem last year My doctors thought I had strep and put me on antibiotics and then put me on allergy medication but when I went to a ear nose and throat specialist they said that my tonsils themselves were the problem and they had to remove them Sometimes general practitioners may not catch a problem like that so it may be necessary to go see a specialist who can more accurately diagnose your problem I am in no way a medical professional merely another peripheral neuropathy PN sufferer However if it were me I would discontinue your diet return to a more balanced moderate meal plan and see if your symptoms disappear It could well be that this unnatural diet is somehow causing these symptoms I suspect that your symptoms have nothing to do with a vitamin deficiency Good luck Also I am a 17 year old female if that helps They already did a pelvic exam to check for any ovarian cists etc They said my appendix wasnt visible on any of the scans so I might not have one I dont know I just need help asap Thanks Kat Thats what my neurologist said too They did a cervical MRI and I am just waiting for the results Is there anything that you do that seems to help High risk of contracting AIDS I have peripheral neuropathy it manifests itself in numbness tingling and pain I probably got it from chemotherapy but its hard to know for sure I have a condition called dyshidrotic eczema and your symptoms sound very similar Although mine mainly appear on my hands the red spots and blisters can appear on both hands and feet The affected area can be very itchy before the blisters appear but generally not while they are present Google dyshidrotic eczema images and see if any of the pictures look similar to what you are experiencing I believe there are tests than can be done to determine whether dishydrotic eczema is present so if I were you I would make an appointment with your doctor to look into it yes im going thru rotator cuff surgery right now and it does go cold soemtime i believe its from the lack of or not enoughcontact from nerves properly Cancer is painless conditionSo only we miss early stageAny lump painless at armpit can be associated with early breast cancerImmediately you must have biopsy done Due to moisture in such places fungal infections are commonPersonal hygiene treatment with antifungal ointments may solve IT can be due to allergy if you are using directly over skin sprays to avoid smell of sweatSo look for this also may try to change to smoking to vaping From my daughters experiences possible nerve impingemen in prone position This could be a condition called Dyshirosis I hope this is the correct spelling I have the same thing periodically You can look it up on here if they are dry and scaly it could be eczema The bad thing about ticks is that they feed off of all kinds of disgusting animals with that being said you need to go to the doctor because ticks can carry Lyme disease and it is dangerous go to the doc and have them take a look because Lyme disease can cause death if it gets bad in your case just sounds like a bacterial infection from that nasty tick either way go to the doc thats my best advice hope i helped No you cannot get genital herpes from fixing someone else make up no you wouldto shakey oh yes with out it your finger could get infected  Call your Doctor It sounds like Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Can be caused from excessive use or repetitive use Try wearing a wrist brace at night or when over using in daily routine It can cause permanent damage if not addressed Seek medical advice the tingling idk about but the coldness in hands and feet can be normal  for years now my feet are always cold even if i have socks on it cold I also get these from time to time Typically one lump under one armpit That said I assumed it was an ingrown hair or some type of irritation from deodorant I ignored these lumps as they were few and far between I also researched the lumps and found that when painful they typically are not serious I noticed online that people suggested draining the lump themselves poking with a needle popping like a zit etc I do not think this is smart whatsoever You will only cause additional irritation One thing I have not seen as a suggestion to ease the pain and draw the lump out of the skin is epsom salt I use a warm compress of water and epsom salt when I get these lumps I do this a few times a day and leave the warm rag under my arm for roughly ten minutes each time This method works The fluid in the lump will draw out and the lump will rupture without poking If there is a deep lump then you have to let nature take its course and let it rise to the surface somewhat on its own but the epsom salt speeds this process along I thought of this method because growing up my mom used epsom salt to draw out slivers or a stinger I am shocked that no one has mentioned this online but thought Id share in hopes it will help someone With one deep lump I had I used the epsom salt compress on and off for about 3 days and on the 3rd day applied GENTLE pressure with the soft parts of my fingers and viola the lump popped and the pain subsided Btw it was grossLOL As for a new experience with lumps that I am currently having I have multiple painful lumps under BOTH sides of my armpits Obviously this is not an ingrown hair I have also been extremely tired have continuous night sweats and shortness of breath I went to my doctor only to find out that I have a severe infection coursing through my body which caused the lumps lymphnode infection They started me on strong antibiotics and I am awaiting results to find out exactly what type of infection I have Hope its not too serious So the long and the short of ita lump with no other symptoms may just be caused by some type of irritation A lump with other symptoms should be inspected by your doctor right away My doctor said that when these types of infections pop up lymphnodes they can get out of hand very quickly Just thought Id share Epsom salt can be found at any drug store or grocery store and is cheap love problem solution astrologer 9829717996 Relationship919829717996 husband Wife love problem solution baba ji This is very strange as I have heard of people having severe allergic reactions to fire ant bites however I have never heard of a case where the reactions lasted as long as five years I would go to the doctors just to make sure there is nothing else that could be causing this do I need to go to the emergency room should I go to the emergency room As a sixty year old male I can tell you that Intercourse is a risky business Men at our age may be fearful of not being able to perform That having been said here is what needs to happen You must start a conversation about your desires and expectations I find that many people want to have sex but they dont want to talk about sex You not mature enough to have sex if you are not mature enough to talk about sex ask if there is a medical problem then ask if there is something that can be done BLUE PILL AND THE LIKE DONT MAKE INTERCOURSE THE BE ALL AND END ALL OF SEX There other ways to be intimate Serious foreplay and oral sex role playing games mutual masturbation be willing to explore and be willing to do what it takes to satisfy each other REMEMBER THE BRAIN IS THE LARGEST SEXUAL ORGAN IN THE BODY NOW GO PLAY AND HAVE FUN Do these areas itch Do you eat a lot of lowfat or diet foods or drink coffee with liquid creamer If you answered yes then you might be having an allergic reaction to Carrageenan Thanks for asking this question I dated a man he was in his mid40s for awhile who was asexual He was affectionate otherwise We traveled together slept together but we never had sex We split up for other reasons nonrelated to this I found some information on the internet but not much to explain why this is so for some Certainly other medical issue can come into play but I dont think that was true in this case the physical reaction to stressful situation is not the same reaction have been occuredhave a many reason if why problem is always beside at in the surroundings and the sulotion or our problem is always open them at the surroundings i have many ideawhy and whyto solve in any situation in our problemfirst in what and why in a problemsecond how and when and where to solve the problem  I have had all bone and blood test and neck and lower back xrayd and examined no abnormalities I have read many articles in the past that sometimes when a virus is leaving the body is does so in the form of a rash But if youre still in doubt just call your drs office and ask for the nurse The nurse should be able to advise you I had a friend her hands were going numb when drivingher dr told her she was holding the steering wheel too tight she had to keep telling herself while driving to not hold the wheel so tight i hope this helps it helped her she just had to change her driving habit Shingles are not contagious However if you have not had chickenpox you may develop chickenpox after being exposed to shingles Only the drainage from the blisters can spread herpes zoster  which is the virus that causes shingles and chickenpox Once the blisters crust over they are no longer contagious and before blisters break out the virus cannot be spread If you have had the chickenpox the herpes zoster virus is already lying dormant in your system To put it in a nutshell one person with shingles CANNOT spread shingles to another person I have been a nurse for 25 years and cared for those with shingles numerous times You need to visit a Gastroenterologist to classify what type of disease you have this may be a serious Gastrointestinal disease that depends on the location of his penis and how much sperm was ejaculated however it is very unlikly Not necessarily Our skin becomes thinner when we age Sun exposure may cause skin thinning so it is very important that you stay out of the sun and use sunblock for skin protection You may see a board certified dermatologist like Dr Eric Schweiger to help you about this not surebut maybe have your sugar checked sometimes a low sugar level will case thattry orange juice and peanut butter crackers if handy a sugar and a protein but definitely consult a dr same thing for me one sting one black wasp on my leg hurt but later very big I suggest u consult your dr u will probably need an epinephrine pen to carry that is an allergy to that wasp if you get stung multiple times you could be in serious trouble as for now benedryl and baking soda water paste and cortisone cream for itching is good but be prepared just in case it happens again sometimes your first reaction is a warning and can be life threatening after that I would definitely look into and have retested by the Endorinologist I have dealt with unexplained pain fatigue weight gain Asthma symptoms Asthma Meds did not helpand many other symptoms and doctors were unable to come up with a diagnosis Thyroid tested fine etc I did find out that I have GERD this is due to vagus stomach nerve not working but none of the meds I tried seemed to help wthose symptoms either My diet doctor tested my thyroid function and found it to be a little low She prescribed a 14 grain of NatureThroid daily and the difference in my joint pain alone is amazing She also prescribed Phentermine which not only helps me lose weight but seems to work in conjunction with Thyroid Med My symptoms of fibro get even better when I am taking both of them I wake up feeling refreshed I dont have trouble walking due to aching joints I used to get so tired I would stutter and forget what I was talking about midsentence Even my stomach problems have all but disappeared Do the research there are many sites and support groups for Fibromyalgia online I would also look into symptoms of low thyroid mine was not that low and was causing lots of havoc Also I think finding the right type of Doctor for exmy Diet Doctor deals with thyroid problems daily and therefore is more knowledgeable is key I would get as much info as I could regarding my symptoms so as to be better able to paint a clearer picture of what is going on to the Endocrinologist you are going to see I have had hypothyroidism for 21 years and it has never cause pain in my hand or my legsRemember though that hypothyroidism is an auto immune disease and once you have one systemic disease you are prone to getting others I also have rheumatoid arthritis which is another autoimmune disease and it first appeared in my hands with severe painI would have my father seen by autoimmune disease doctor Judging from your screen name as a diabetic you want to keep your hands clean cause you will not heal as quickly This is why your DRY hands wont heal as quickly I do not see your hands so I can not rule out a rash but I feel you may be confusing a rash with just general dryness Try some eucerin or cetaphil lotion its supposed to heal dry cracked skin Except some folks say it burns you may want to try to neutrogena skin therapy cream they have some serious stuff at the grocery store for dry skin go take a gander and see which bottle matches your hands The winter months make dry hands worse so keep inside and keep warm it means he is low on oxygen and he should probably go to the ER even if he doesnt want to My mother has those symptoms and her doctor diagnosed it as RA Mother said she would awaken with her hands asleep and sometimes the entire arm plus the tingling feeling before having any pain Time passed and she began having arthritis pains So she calls the tingling and the hands being asleep PreArthritis I think you will be okay Its not like you actually had their blood on your hands and Ive never heard of blood dried on paper harming anyone Take a deep breath you are going to be okay Check in with your general practioner or local medical clinic Its probably infected IM NOT A DOCTOR BUT AM STUDYING BASIC MEDICINE go to the doctors and see what they have to say  maybe its the gloves i would definatley seek doctor specialy if its speading and turning into pus you may have an infection Take care of your diarrhea firstGet a good doctor who speicalizes in that area Get off the soft drinks The diarrhea is draining out all energy You can die from diarrhea that last for a long period of time Use Arnica its a gel that can be applied to bruises and can be purchased at the health food store It could be tendonitis or carpal tunnel due to repetitve strain injury You may also get numbness or tingling in the fingers or hand and wrist It can cause the symptoms you are describing If keep having symptoms I would see an orthopedic hand specialist to get diagnosed Marieh9 my niece had something similar that was long lasting it was a form of viral infection that was recurring Seek medical attention If it feels hot it may be infected   I have severe numbness in my arm and hand while sleeping that wakes me up causing restlessness and anxiety from lack of sleep what could cause this i dont think you have anything to worry about seeing how worms are very common in dogs  puppy almost always have something like that  i feel that if there was a chance that the kids could catch em more kids in general would have them u know what i mean i think ur babies are in the clear  now that ur pup is done with his medsjust relax and enjoy him rememebr just like kids dogs only stay lil for so long  hope this helped i dont know truely based on your past history  if it was unrealated i was think its just clean and or maybe u have heathly olis in ur skin but if you feel its cause for concern call ur doctor  i would think itf ur skin is thin that would would see ur vains very easy  and with that prob get cut easy also  but in my gut i dont think its thin skin  hope this helped i would go to the doctor and talk about this tell the doc about what happend to you grandma  it sounds like it could be something that can really make problems  the basics when a body part falls asleep as we say thats due to lack of bloodflow to that part of the bodycould be that somethings stopping your bloodflow to your hands that could have been the same thing happening to your grandma or it could be your nerves which means something in ur brain of on the way to your hands is breaking the signal  because our brains tell our bodies what to do with small electric chargers  think if it like this you have a short in your house and your lights flicker  kinda the same idea  either way def go to your doctor for this  even more so cause your grandma is having the same problem  it likely that this is somehow connected through geins  hope this help and good luck idk if its your hands per say i only know if you do too much mas its likely to happen you gotta let your lil friend get his normal feeling back  it happens to women also dont worry just give him a rest  hope this helped id say a week or so As it was your own fecal matter and not someone elses I wouldnt worry too much Blow your nose real well and maybe rinse with some water It should take care of itself naturally However if the inside of your nose gets very sore or infected or you think you had an open cut in your nose that the fecal matter could have gotten into speak to your doctor Her rubbing hand lotion on you or the condom should not give you HIV Blood and body fluids pass HIV So as long as she didnt have blood on her hands or vaginal fluids on her hands you should be fine But remember that other STDs can be passed to people even when condoms are used Its less likely but it can happen Your testicules are arent covered by a condom so be careful who you have sex with Not sure exactly what you have but there are blood tests used to help diagnose arthritis and inflammation If you havent had any blood tests done Id ask your doctor for some My husband and I use Wild Wipes and we love them Wild Wipes are intimate wipes for men and women theyre really soft and smell really nice Their website is wwwwildwipescom and if you use promo code wild you get free shipping too I had same symptom on right thumb and it turned out to be a cyst Does the lump move a bit when pushed from the side Have your self checked out for a possible blood clot I had the same thing happen to me a few ears ago and that is what they found in my right lung This answer is true Most fractures especially of bigger bones will take 6 to 8 weeksSmaller bones like those of the fingers andor wrist will only take 45 weeks Just gotta baby them The body is made to heal itself Just let it What is considered normal on lab tests may not necessarily be normal for you Let me give you some background information The test they usually perform to initially diagnose hypothyroidism is TSH or thyroid stimulating hormone It has an inverse relationship with your actual thyroid hormone Think of it as a bill collector If you dont respond when the bill collector knocks on your door they will start to knock on your door or call you with increasing frequency until you do respond The TSH is the bill collector and if your thyroid isnt paying the bills aka isnt producing enough thyroid hormone T4 TSH levels will continue to increase until the thyroid responds or your pituitary master gland decides its a hopeless cause and TSH production decreases or stops The reason for this diatribe is because people get confused when they are told they have hypothyroidism and their TSH is too high They dont realize the TSH is not actually the thyroid hormone which is the hormone that will be low in this case I just want to ensure there is no confusion when your provider gives you lab results Some providers dont realize that if your TSH is in the upper range of normal people and especially women may still have symptoms Thus you may want to work with your doctor on getting your TSH down to the lower ranges of normal 07 2 approximately  The range used to be 05 to 5 for TSH The national board of endocrinology now suggests the normal range be changed to 03 to 3 because people are still having symptoms despite being within normal range I prefer to keep my TSH around 1 because thats when I feel normal Everybody is different so that may not work for you What it boils down to is you are a person not a lab result if you have symptoms tell your primary care doctor Do some research write down questionssymptoms when you think of them and talk to your PCP about it If you do not think he or she is taking you seriously get a second opinion carpal tunnel surgery Thanks for your question its an interesting topic I just read a new study regarding numbness in different areas of the body The study said that all through the spine there are small nerves that are connected to every part of the body Sometimes when youre stresseddont feel good or your spine is misalinged even slightlyit can make those nerves fire off and cause numbness in the part of the body the nerves are connected to Your friend doesnt automatically have Neuromotor Disease or anything serious like that She just needs to start with a chiropractic consultation who if need be can refer her to a spine specialist if it is indeed the nerves in the spine firing off I hope this helps in anywayat least so you or she can know where to start looking at No httppmahoneybuythistodayinfo Hi no I have very severe multiple site OA I have it in both thumbs and now fingers rest ice or heat antiinflammatory pain meds Tylenol is a good pain reliever but will do nothing for the inflammation if you have inflammation I use heating pads as I dont always tolerate the ice The cold is what will cause me more pain such as a drop in outdoor temps in winter Try capsasin but be very very careful that you do not get it near your face eyes and mouth Capsasin used to work great on my back early on in the OA battle but now it does not work for me Good luck I have had 4 done twice bilaterally Pain stopped within a couple of months the first time The second operations not so good New EMG NCV reveal that the carpal tunnel is still there and the left is minor the right is moderate to severe Oh well I dont think I will have again this is called edema and can be cause by many things i suggest u look up what can cause edema of the extremeties  my husband is diabetic and says his does same thing when sugars r low and high  what are fibromyalgia affects varicose veinssee your doctor get wraps to support your hands while you workmaybe ask your doctor about carpal tunnelmine get that way when I get tired and try to put weight on them My daughter caught it from her friend 5 yrs ago and it was from putting her slippers on I never caught it tho when I rubbed the ointment on her back where it wasI immediately washed my hands tho too I guess different people affected differently by things this is a sign of anxiety you have it under control but still go and see your doctor for more elvaluation I was taking topamax for an angioma on my brain a couple of years ago after taking it for a week I had to stop taking it as it caused me to shake continously loss of appetite everything tasted of dill pickles and didnt sleep was wide awake for 4 days my hands and feet are cold 90 of the time they also get red when its hot and purple when its cold I have been told it is because I have a weak heart I have no problem my stomic i would have it checked for eczema try using eucerin or aquaphor and cortisone cream a couple times a day you can not have any probems form that kind of contact so you have nothing to worry about It depends on what the causes are I would need more information Are you experiencing it on only one side cause that might be a sign of a stroke or possible mini stroke known as a tiaThat is what happened to me twice but my was cause by blood clots that traveled to my brainI had two strokes age 27 and 38 and now I am 43 if the bruising is getting worse you need to go to the doctor and make sure that is not a blood clot and or it could be a busted blood vein which will never go back to normal Sorry there is no cure yet But they feel that stem cell may be of help I too have parkinsons Michael J Fox has a wonderful web site About stem cell reserch Get checked for a TFCC tear That sounds like what I went through dont waste your time here in sharing it with us as this is issue related with health so just go consul an expert man Sounds like it could be bad circulation or low iron If an iron supplement doesnt help it could be the other At first when she told me that sex was out and kissing was out I was devastated as I was most attracted Since then we have cuddled and I have found another who is more participatory Maybe this other gal is better for me I am busy trying to find my way in a forest of goddesses so the key is how well you can talk especially about sex If it avoided as a topic it may be the best indicator that it will not improve unfortunately Friendships are fine but they really take second place to a potential sexual and sensual partner So the priorities shift based on what you think is happening and the only way to judge is based on what is said In many cases it takes risk to raise certain subjects and once one risk is made unsuccessfully another risk is less likely and the final outcome is evident Cant get blood from a stone Norl sexual love from someone unwilling thats a good taboo Find someone willing is the only way out of the dilemma Check all your medication for side effects Need to get MRI of back for any spine disorders Exercise moderately to strengthen back muscles arthritis onset HIV cant be transmitted this way Bed bugs Do not mix and put steroid on first Unless you touch bodily fluid tissue or saliva of the animal with broken skin like a cut or scrape of something like that youre safe
