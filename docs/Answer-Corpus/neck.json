{"text": "I had same problem wneck Please go get Cat scan they blew it off cause I was too young to have Throat Cancer Well I just finished operation on inside of throat 29 treatments of chemotherapy and radiation for STAGE 4 THROAT CANCER FROM HPV Good luck It sounds like it could be a mild form of staff I had something similar and my doctor gave me pills But another doctor told me to take a bath in plain water and a cap of bleach and after about a week it went away Was the head removed Thinkdid the front of the tick between its front legs have a drop of bloodliguid visible after removal Was the tick at all actively flailing its legstrying to move As opposed to a piece of you attached to it resembling a small blood blot and a highly active tick IF RECENTLY ATTACHED Hey dont worry This can be due to following reasons You dont like attending classes You are not interested in homework and dont understand in class So for this try to make yourself attentive in class when you start understanding you will automatically start doing HW as well as feel interested in classes Tell her to goto another doctor those are also symptoms of a heart attack Dont want to cause undue worry but I had those symptoms that was leading up to my heart attack To feel like you are dying at age 18 is very concerning You should definitely consult your family physician and possibly see a specialist Persistent symptoms after Lyme disease has been treated appropriately with antibiotics is a very controversial area We do know that longterm antibiotics do not help and are associated with serious complications We also know from recent studies that Lyme disease does not relapse but you can get reinfected The most common symptom of Lyme disease is a classical rash erythema migrans and patients who get this rash again have another infection not a relapse A small percentage of patients who are treated for Lyme disease 1020 develop persistent symptoms which may last for 6 months or more This syndrome is called Posttreatment Lyme Disease Syndrome PTLDS According to the most recent advice from the Centers for Disease Control CDC there are many fraudulent products claiming to treat chronic Lyme disease So be cautious and make sure you are not being treated by quacks Treatment by a physician associated with a University teaching hospital would be a good choice In addition to seeing your physician and making sure there is no other condition responsible for your symptoms the CDC recommends that you eat a healthy diet and get plenty of rest talk to a counselor and keep a diary of your activities and symptoms Pregnancy can be a scary time and all women worry about whether something they did might harm their baby The best advice is to never take any medication both over the counter and prescription during pregnancy without first discussing this with your doctor The first trimester is a time where the baby is developing and miscarriages happen A few studies have suggested that medicines like ibuprofen which is a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug NSAID can increase the risk of a miscarriage in the first trimester But other studies have failed to find a connection A recent study done at Vanderbilt though has good news This study looked at overthecounter NSAID use in pregnant women during the first six weeks of pregnancy and found that there was not an increased risk of miscarriage There are also concerns that NSAIDs can cause heart problems in the baby in the third trimester In general women should avoid medication use during pregnancy if possible and always talk to their doctor first Most experts think that acetaminophen Tylenol rather than an NSAID is a safer option for occasional pain relief during pregnancy My personal preference is heat It seems to be better for me than ice Some people get better relief from ice so I would suggest try them both and then use what works the best for you I get this too Its due to the high salturea level of your sweat Assuming it irritates your skin but the irritation is in areas like armpits and groin using a barrieranti chafing cream just mustnt be water soluble will reduce the irritation to the point you may not get a rash  Id go to the doctor She is probably allergic Although I dont known your medical history or possible other symptoms I highly recommend that you seek emergency treatment immediately As a matter of fact please and allow professional medical personnel to assess the cause of your pain You have everything to lose by delaying medical evaluation  The first doctor to assess the condition should be your primary care physician The family doctor will be able to review the patients medical history and will have familiarity with your husbands overall health The diagnostic process for neck pain can involve different body systems The pain can be caused by nerve disorders muscle injuries and even some diseases such as infections The general practice doctor can evaluate the symptoms order diagnostic tests like blood work and xrays and determine what kind of specialist is needed Based on your husbands condition and preliminary tests results the primary care physician may start treatment before referring him to one of the following specialist Back and neck problems can become like a painful nightmare Since youve tried OTC medications coupled with heatice compresses without improvement it is time to see the Family Doctor If he cannot be seen within a day or two a visit to the local hospitals emergency room is justified I hope that your husbands condition improves quickly It is unlikely that your knee surgery has any relationship with your stiff neck Stiff necks are most frequently a result of trauma in the form of moving suddenly in a jerky fashion The stiff neck may also be caused by haphazard sleeping positions or maintaining a general poor posture Treatment of a stiff neck may start with warm compresses massage of the affected area with over the counter muscle creams and liquids and the taking of analgesic medications If your neck remains stiff and painful after 72 hours following the recommended treatment a visit to your family doctor or the chiropractor is justified I hope that youve already received the answers that youre seeking along with a large dose of positive resolutionI just saw your posting today the sixth day and wanted to offer my help I am not an expert in diagnosing medical conditions but do have an education and work history directed heavily in the medical sciences Additionally my daughter and soninlaw have been paramedics for over 15 years With that introduction here are my thoughts on your symptoms and blood studies 1 As you know  some of your symptoms can easily fit into more that one medical category Additionally your symptoms and out of range lab results are suggestive of irregularities that could be associated with various body organ abnormalities Some of these conditions are very serious while many others are much more palatable I am sure that at this point you just want an answer 2 My list of possible medical conditions include  Pyelonephritis  Diabetic Hypoglycemia  Pancreatitis  Miscarriage  Pelvic Inflammatory Disease  Stomach Cancer and  Diverticular Diseases of the Colon Please feel well soon Its can be tough diagnosing an itchy body Hives are red itchy welts on the skin and may be caused by various allergic agents and even nervous conditions Treatment of hives is directed at removing the source of the offending source I had a generalized body itch took the same course of action as you and eventually broke down and was seen in a walkin medical clinic for professional help My symptoms were mostly limited to feeling itchy from head to toe with only a faint trace of a skin rash I though that I had considered all possible causes including bug bites and new products entering my body such as foods beverages soaps and medications I also noted that my wife who shared our common bed was free of the same symptoms Obviously I was not contagious In my situation the hives condition was caused by an oral antbiotic that I had already taken for 5 days Since I had previously taken this same anti biotic in the past without negative consequences and didnt immediately see a reaction to the current treatment regime I mistakenly excluded the antibiotic as my allergic source In my case I was given an injectable dose of corticosteroid prescribed Prednisone and directed to terminate the offending antbiotic In your case after 34 days without resolving the issue through hydro cortisone and antihistamines its probably time to see a doctor Of course you may be serviced at an urgent care clinic but I dont see that as being your best choice Urgent care center doctors see individuals for relatively uncomplicated matters that can be resolved in one visit Conditions such as colds viruses rashes minor injuries bruises cuts requiring stiches and infections are typical types of straight forward easily diagnosable cases that respond well to immediate treatment A migraine headache is a symptom of some other disorder within the body such as hormonal changes headneck injury alcohol consumption sexual activity eye conditions ears nose  throat disorders emotional stress ingesting certain foods and beverages environmental factors such as breathing polluted air and many other reasons There is also a relationship between family heredity as a predisposing factor seen in suffers with migraines I recommend that you begin your search for resolution by making an appointment with a migraine headache specialist Other doctors who may provide you with answers to your headaches include Neurologists Pain Management Specialists OBGYN Specialists Endocrinologists and Allergy Specialists The next task is to begin keeping a journal of all daily activates It should include times dates all physical and emotional events all foods and beverages consumed and of course headaches Note the start and end times for all headaches the quality of the headache What does it feel like your pain level 1  10 treatments attempted and your response to those treatments If the headaches cannot be reduced in their number of episodes or their intensity in a reasonable amount of time then going to a hospital emergency room or urgent care center is justified In the interim  take the medications as instructed maintain a quiet and dark environment during acute headache periods apply a facial ice packand or heat to the painful areas eat and drink nutritious meals and rest as needed Unfortunately migraine headaches are painful and may be difficult to diagnosis in the differential process of identifying the precipitating factors known triggers which are unique to the individual sufferer of a migraine headache Feel better soon  10K 20K is a big price range and although very expensive it could be the going rate depending on some variables There can be a big difference in medical procedure costs based upon the geographical area of the country the person who is doing the procedure the exact type of epidural procedure and the facility where the procedure will be preformed The costs are typically lower when preformed in a doctors office but that savings comes with additional risks for medical complications Of course large medical insurance carriers can negotiate the costs of procedures significantly lower to what is referred to as Usual  Customary Charges wherein a noninsured individual pays the highest rates I see a common range for the epidural procedure to be between 3000  7000 It is probably in your best interest to contact multiple providers for this procedure in your area and compare prices Some large hospitals make available as public information on their web site the average charge for most procedures  I am sorry for the suffering that Motor Neuron Disease is delivering to your father I am equally sorry for the stress that it has caused you and your family Watching your fathers quality of life deteriorate over a 45 year period must almost be unbearable Crafting an honest and complete answer to your question was especially difficult for me MND is a horrible disorder that may begin slowly but quickly picks up speed with its destructive disease advancement Motor Neuron Disease is progressive and leads to nearly complete paralysis and breathing distress Most cases of MND are due to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ALSL or Lou Gehrig Disease Currently the medication Riluzole is the only FDA approved drug used to treat MND Riluzole is hardly a silver bullet in the effort to treat MND Studies have shown some benefit of Riluzole to slow the disease process As you probably know the prognosis for MND is grim If you want to know the true devastating and shattering life expectancy projections for MND after its initial diagnosis please continue reading my answer My opinions First of all each life is unique and precious I believe that miracles are possible New treatment options for MND are being worked on Nobody can predict exactly how the published survival rates apply to your fathers disease With that said there is currently no cure for MND and treatment efforts usually turn to palliative measures Hospice care can be a key ingredient to ensuring patient comfort as the disease finalizes its assault on the muscles of the individual Here are the sad statistical survival rates for MND 1 in 5 will remain living after 5 years of its diagnosis 1 in 10 will remain living after 10 years of its initial diagnosis I recommend that you and your family talk with the physician treating your father with Riluzole Perhaps your father should also be part of that discussion The specialty of that doctor is not as important as their familiarity with your fathers case That individual can best assess your fathers future prognosis The tumor in the lumbar area is most likely unrelated to MND But the tumor should be assessed and recommendations made for its possible treatment You deserve honest answers to your questions and concerns May you and your family experience peace during this time of uncertainty The first step to take should be to have a complete medical exam including blood studies and a medication reviewsometimes different doctors prescribe medications without knowledge of the other doctors prescribed medications Too much medication can influence your energy level and cause drowsiness Once you are found to be medically fit no cancer no heart or major organ problemsyou may move on to what I suspect is the cause of your fatigue that is your chronic physical pain and resultant depression Your next step may be to seek a referral to be seen by an orthopedic surgeon to receive appropriate treatment options for your neck back shoulders torn rotator cuff and torn ACL This one doctor along with a pain management specialist may be able to keep your pain level within an acceptable range without taking large doses of energy draining medications Finally continue with your counseling and seek methods to reduce stress in your life Stress causes emotional and physical problems Eat nutritious meals exercise as permitted by your physician and as tolerated take neighborhood walks to see nature animals and to interact with other people and get 8 hours of sleep each night My plan is not a magic bullet but it is different from what you are doing now Your current plan of action is leaving you in pain in a chronic sleepy state and joyless You deserve better  I have right bundle branch block and my physician not was not concerned He explained to me that if it had been a left bundle branch block that he may have done investigation beyond my EKG test According to my doctor the majority of cardiac work is completed on the left side My understanding is that a left bundle branch block may have little to no significance or its presence could indicate underlying cardiac disease Left bundle branch block is sometimes seen with Cardiac Enlargement Aortic Valve Disease and a host of other cardiac conditions Although most organs of the body work like a finely tuned orchestra irritable bowel syndrome and back problems more than likely are issues not related to a diagnosis of left bundle branch block the LBBB finding and recommend that you discuss it with your doctor and determine if further workup is needed Perhaps a referral to a competent cardiologist heart specialist is justified  Swollen neck lymph nodes may be the result of an infection inflammation cancer or viruses In your case it is suspected that your recent cold is the cause of the enlarged neck lymph node Treatment is dependent on the cause with bacterial infections possibly needing antibiotics a virus needing to run its course and cancers being attacked with multiple individualized treatments The link below will access a WebMd article on the topic of lymph nodes httpwwwwebmdcomatozguidesswollenlymphnodestopicoverviewwwparam1307921683 I meant to put tourettes not torrents Sorry Could be pinch nerve in neck have a Nerve conductive test done ask doctor I have the same thing an thats what we found was pinch nerve in neck  I had been having a similar problem for quite some time It got so bad that I finally went and saw a Chiropractor He gave me 1 suggestion and I tried it It worked for a couple of nights Lay flat on your back with 1 pillow under your head and pillows on both sides of you When that stopped working for me I was then seeing a Physical Therapist She suggested that I lay on my side whichever side was more comfortable with 1 pillow under my head a pillow between my legs a small towel roll between my waist and the bed and a body pillow behind my back I have been sleeping that way for over a month now and it has been amazing I fall asleep much quicker and then I sleep really well through the night My daughter has cat scratch fever wheb she was little it would start with a sore throat and the throat would get infected a huge knot of puss went from one side of her kneck to the other Finally had to take her to the hospital and an dr numb her kneck where the infection was at and lanced it to get the puss out the puss was the infection going from one side to the other so yes you need to see a dr soon as possible It can be treat with HT Hormone Therapy in which women need to opt for Birth control or oral contraception pills It is prescribed because they contain hormones estrogen and progesterone and helpful to control irregular periods So you can opt for Depo Provera Nexplanon and Ovral G etc And to get them at your doorstep you may go for online pharmacy Meds247online For your any dental problem plz click here

same numbness happens tingley feeling extreme pain where i have to sit down and try to focus so will quit spinning Ive seen a Dr already and he keeps on subscribing different pills that dont work Any thoughts One may have the wrong strenght in their personaland or reading glasses Firstly this is a problem to be solved by a team approach First see a derm and an endocrinologist They together will check for hormonal imbalances such as PCOS  PCOS polycystic ovarian disease which can result in excessive body hair and facial hair It can also be accompanied by cystic acne and weight gain There are many other causes of excess hair growth  Sometimes it is genetic or cause from certain medications Some ethnicities grow darker thicker hairs as well In general a routine blood test to look for PCOS and other abnormalities can lead to a simple treatment with a medication and as well laser hair removal Remember  please see an endocrinologist and a dermatologist as well as your gynecologist Stick with boardcertified physicians looked into getting MRI or seeing an Orthopedic specialist for a pinched Nerve or cervical Neck problems Had a Neck n 2 shoulder repairs I have been in pain just like yours since last Shoulder surgery n told possible SSN Super Scapular Nerve problems I would consult your doctor asap They may want to do a scope to look inside your throat for possible tumors What kind of pain is it Is it located in your throat itself or in the neck in general You can use products developed for use on the face Look for ingredients such as retinoids retinol retinyl propionate and others peptides vitamin C niacinamide caffeine grape seed extract marine extract and other antioxidants There are excellent chemical peels or laser peels your dermatologist can offer you to help treat this very sensitive area My preference is the fractional CO2 laser It could be from sun exposure fragrance or any underlying even subtle irritation that causes inflammation of the skin can leave behind discoloration also known as hyperpigmentation There is also a type of yeast infection called tinea versicolor that can leave your neck back and upper arms looking blotchy Your dermatologist will be able to help clarify and offer you the proper treatment to clear the condition It could be psoriasis or a condition called seborrheic dermatitis Both are chronic conditions but have different underlying causes and somewhat different treatments You can start by using a salicylic acidbased wash and OTC hydrocortisone and a salicylic acid or tarbased shampoo If it does not improve your dermatologist will be able to evaluate and offer prescription treatments to better control the condition There are no treatments similar to Botox that last longer Botox does work very well in the right candidate to smooth neck bands but not for excess skin There are new radiofrequency and less invasive liposuctionlike devices that are coming in the next year or so that may work well for turkey necks but nothing beyond liposuction and plastic surgery for now There are no treatments similar to Botox that last longer Botox does work very well in the right candidate to smooth neck bands but not

antioxidants Has a Doctor verified you have an ear infection  I had HORRIBLE pain in my ear I went through 5 courses of antibiotics before the decision was made that I should see a Specialist The problem was not in my ear the glands in my neck were blocked and were pressing against my ear I had a huge bulge under my jaw from the infection I had surgery at MD Anderson Hospital almost a year ago and all is fine Thank you for reaching out with this question Its an important one for others your age who have your symptoms My advice Check with your doctor before doing any exercise at all even walking for exercise He or she can give you specific instructions for what type of exercises to do for how long and at what intensity If you decide to walk anyway hey I know how you 86 year olds are please have someone with you at all times Because of your weakness I have a real concern about your falling and breaking a hip Right now you may need to focus more on diet than on exercising especially since you say you feel extremely weak I salute you for being a survivor and wish you many more healthful years You inspire me Honestly the only way to diagnose strep is through a lab test Even if all the signs like throat redness and symptoms like soreness are there it still may not be strep Even white spots in the back of the mouth are no guarantee its a case of strep is almost always accompanied by fever Are you using a thermometer to measure your sons temperature or are you relying on the old handtotheforehead method Its very important to use a thermometer when assessing fever I mention this because it never ceases to amaze me how many people do not have this basic tool in their medicine cabinets Keep in mind also if youre giving your son acetaminophen Tylenol to ease the pain of the sore throat this could cause him to register a normal temperature on the thermometer because acetaminophen is a feverreducer Instead of speculating about what might be going on with your son I suggest you take him to his pediatrician Since the problem has been going on for nearly a week its not a bad idea to get medical attention I hope your little boy feels better soon Wishing you well Im sorry you experience this It doesnt sound pleasant thats for sure Whenever a patient describes pain with words like jolt of electricity we tend to think in terms of nerve pain Only a physical examination and perhaps some testing like Xrays or MRI can say for sure whats going on with your neck That said I would suspect you occasionally pinch a nerve when you turn your head suddenly This type of can occur if you have a spinal disc that is slowly collapsing or if you have some arthritis in the vertebrae spinal bones of your neck While I dont think this situation is an emergency I would suggest you get this checked out by a health care provider soon Catching spine problems early usually results in a better outcome You can start with a visit to your primary care provider and he or she can get the ball rolling Hope this helps Im sorry youre going through this Pain is never fun I would urge you to get in to see your doctor as soon as possible What youre describing does not sound like a migraine at all but it could possibly be an ear infection In rare cases an untreated ear infection can move into the bone behind the ear This normally happens in children and is called  No matter what the underlying cause of this pain is the fact its ongoing and seems to be getting worse means you need medical attention If you cant get an office visit its probably time for a visit to urgent care Feel better Im sorry youre going through this It sounds very unpleasant A number of things could be going on here but its not likely your gallbladder is involved The gallbladder is located on the right side of the body near the bottom of your rib cage Its doubtful the gallbladder could refer any pain to the left shoulder I can think of any number of reasons youd be having this pain from a slight fracture to a injury to an aggravated  The only way to find out whats going on is to see a medical professional for an examination and possibly other testing like an Xray Id suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider PCP to have this evaluated It would be helpful to evaluate it when its actually flaring up but that might be impossible to time Even if youre not having a pain episode your PCP might be able to come to some conclusion as to the cause of this pain and get you started on treatment Best of luck to you If the situation concerns you the best bet is to call your primary care provider or if you feel the situation is lifethreatening call 911 Since you said this same thing happened the last two times she received steroid injections to the neck it sounds as if this may be her bodys normal way of reacting to the injection However any time you become worried or frightened about a persons or your own reaction to a medical procedure its a good idea to seek medical attention I hope you find this response helpful Im sorry to hear youre suffering like this Its bad enough to take on a new job without then coming down with mysterious physical symptoms Unfortunately its impossible to tell whether this is serious or not Obviously you should know the and also know the  While anyone can have a heart attack its more likely among people with multiple risk factors I would suggest you make an appointment with your primary health care provider to evaluate your symptoms Your provider probably will want to run some tests such as blood work or possibly and EKG Many medical conditions could cause the symptoms you describe including low thyroid Your health care provider can correlate your health history with your new symptoms to arrive at a diagnosis I hope you feel better soon Im sorry youre going through this and that the medications didnt give you any relief When symtpoms persist after treatment its always a good idea to return to the doctor to update him or her and get reevaluated Id suggest you do just that Tinea barbae is a type of  which is an inflammation of the hair follicle the part of the hair thats embedded in your skin caused by an infection Tinea barbae is caused by a fungus which is why your health care provider prescribed an antifungal cream clotrimazole to treat it However since that didnt work its time to get the rash rechecked Id suggest you also share with your doctor that overthecounter lotions and creams made the rash worse If possible tell him or her specifically which items you used That may help get you a better diagnosis Good luck to you Im sorry your mom is going through this It sounds like a very uncomfortable situation If its been less than a week since your mom saw the doctor then you may just need to hang in there awhile longer The symptoms you describe could be caused by many conditions including a cold virus You may need to take a watchful waiting approach to see if the situation gets better or worse If it gets better then great If it gets worse Id suggest a return trip to the doctor Keep in mind Im just making suggestions I am not in a position to suggest a diagnosis or give medical advice Hope your mom feels better soon Good question I guess Im assuming youre the one with and that you have had this diagnosis confirmed by a doctor If not and you suspect you have in your neck obviously you need to see a doctor as soon as possible because the situation could be very dangerous Bones are very good at repairing themselves In fact bones are constantly remodeling their structure replacing old cells with new ones The type of treatment for a bone fracture depends on the location and severity of the break For example a simple broken arm may be treated only with stabilization a cast while the bone mends itself On the other hand a severe fracture of bones in the ankle may require surgery with the use of screws and plates to hold the bone fragments together Like I said if you suspect you have a broken bone in your neck from an injury you need to seek medical attention A doctor will advise you on what treatment is required if any for the situation Best wishes to you Im sorry youre experiencing this Medical diagnosis and treatment can be very confusing sometimes Certainly in the neck cervical vertebrae can cause pain The pain is caused by pressure on the nerve roots where they extend from the spinal cord and through the vertebrae If the discs in your neck are degenerating becoming stiff or even collapsing this can put pressure on the nerves and cause pain Sometimes a doctor will look at pictures of your neck from an Xray or MRI and will not see any areas of nerve compression Because of this he or she will tell you you shouldnt be having any pain However its not always possible to see a compressed nerve on an Xray or MRI If youre having pain in your neck you can return to your doctor to let him or her know this Your doctor will determine what type of treatment might work best to relieve your symptoms I hope you find relief soon The type of flushing you describe after drinking alcohol is not necessarily unusual Alcohol consumption causes veins to dilate get larger which can cause the skin to appear reddened This venous dilation also is the cause of the warm feeling many people associate with moderate drinking Absent any other symptoms you probably need not worry about this bit of flushing caused by consuming a moderate amount of alcohol Note however if you take any prescription medications you should consult your health care provider or a pharmacist before consuming alcohol in any amount Alcohol can affect medications in many different ways so if you are drinking even wine or beer you want to make sure its safe for you Wishing you well Im sorry youre going through this It sounds absolutely miserable Because this situation is now going on three weeks I would suggest you get it checked out You may be able to avoid the emergency room and the high fees involved by searching in your community for a free or lowcost health care clinic Sometimes these have the name healthcare for the homeless but you usually dont have to be homeless to take advantage of the services I cannot provide a hotlink here but if you visit httpwwwhrsagovgethealthcareaffordableindexhtml you can search for lowcost health care in your area I wish you all the best with this Im glad to hear all is good and I hope I can help set your mind at ease A in the neck can send pain radiating down the shoulder and arm  and even into the chest area which could indeed feel like the symptoms of a  Presumably you received an Xray or MRI scan of your neck This is usually how a pinched nerve in the neck is diagnosed Pinched nerves in the neck are often caused by compression of a disk in the spinal column of the neck This compression puts pressure on the nerve which in turn causes the pain Youre right that theres no relationship between a pinched nerve in the neck and a heart problem Its just that the pinched nerve caused you to have pain that was similar to what a person feels when they have a heart attack Hope this helps So sorry to hear youre going through this Its difficult to cope with severe pain Unless youre experiencing along with this pain in your neck please do not clog up the emergency room The emergency department should be reserved for true lifeordeath emergencies or serious traumas like broken bones Unfortunately severe neck pain doesnt rise to that level What youre describing sounds like the classic symptom of a  There are many possible causes for  ranging from a to a  It sounds like youve done everything right in terms of home treatment However one round of ibuprofen one hot shower and one good massage may not be enough to alleviate the pain especially if its caused by something like a herniated disk Also note No one should take more than 2400 milligrams of ibuprofen within a 24hour period and no more than 800mg every 8 hours Again assuming youre not exhibiting any which generally dont include stabbing pain at the base of the neck your best bet is to continue to try home remedies If the situation doesnt clear up within a few days make an appointment with your primary health care provider for an evaluation If the situation gets worse such as your arm starts to go numb then you might consider heading for an urgent care facility Wishing you well Unfortunately your question is lacking crucial information to provide a good answer How old is your son Has he received routine childhood vaccines Enlarged lymph nodes can signal a variety of potential conditions Your best bet is to take your son to his pediatrician for an exam If your son has not been immunized against the MMR vaccine you definitely should seek medical attention Mumps in a young man generally older than age 10 can cause a related condition called  which is swelling of the testicles This can cause fertility problems down the road Regardless of your sons immunization status having enlarged lymph nodes is not normal and you should seek medical attention If your son is running a high fever you should seek emergency medical treatment Wishing you well Im sorry to hear youre going through this generic name hydrocodoneacetaminophen shouldnt cause your blood pressure to spike Quite the opposite in fact Pain can cause your blood pressure to go up though so be sure to take enough medication to keep your pain adequately controlled Several things can cause your blood pressure to spike temporarily including needing to urinate pee However if your postoperative pressure is above whats normal for you please call your surgeons office to advise them about whats going on They need to know I wish you all the best with this Im sorry youre going through this I want to caution you however that you should never selfadminister antibiotics Its this type of usage that is causing a rise in the development of antibioticresistant bacteria Your best bet is to see a medical professional Your condition can only be diagnosed through a physical exam and possibly some other testing such as a throat swab or blood work It could as you speculate be a virus If it is it should clear up in 714 days No antibiotics required However it could be something other than a virus Many conditions can cause the symptoms youre describing from an inflamed salivary gland to an abscessed tooth The only way to find out is to visit a health care provider I wish you all the best Im sorry to hear youre going through this It just goes to show how negatively pain can impact so many aspects of our lives I commend you for being committed to your sexual health and marital relationship Youre a good wife for wanting to build that intimacy back up Id suggest you start by assessing what nonsexual positions are the most comfortable for you For example if sitting in a chair provides relief try adapting that for a sexual purpose Have your husband sit on a chair and then sit on your husband if that makes sense Another suggestion is to try having sex in a water environment such as the shower or a bathtub This may be especially helpful if warm water gives you pain relief Just be careful nobody slips You may simply have to experiment to find positions that work for you Do not be shy about seeking out aids such as swings or slings that suspend from the ceiling if you need something like that to help take pressure off your back during sex A less expensive and less permanent solution may involve plenty of pillows to prop and support body parts Again experimentation is going to be key here If you feel shy about expressing your feelings or needs to your partner please dont hesitate to consult your doctor a nurse or a psychotherapist whos experienced in sexual health to help with communication and to help you find solutions Believe me they will understand your concerns and treat you with utmost respect All the best to you Well I recommend you get this checked out Heart problems can hit like lightning heart attack or come on gradually It sounds like you may have a heart problem thats becoming gradually worse Of course this can only be determined with a physical examination and some other testing performed by your health care provider Chest pain that lasts 8 hours is nothing to ignore Please get medical attention as soon as you can All the best to you Gosh its really hard to say what could be causing this without performing a physical examination Have you injured the shoulder Slept on it wrong Do you engage in contact sports Any of these things could cause the symptoms you describe It could be a pulled muscle muscle spasms shoulder injury nerve root compression at the spine  and thats just for starters Id suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider to have this checked out With a good physical exam and possibly some other testing your provider should be able to diagnose and treat the source of the symptoms Hope you feel better soon Im confused If the MRI showed bilateral  why would you believe thats not the cause of your symptoms Mastoiditis is an infection of the skull bone that lies just behind the ear It normally is treated with oral antibiotics because its a bacterial infection Ear drops also are frequently used If you have any questions about your diagnosis or treatment you should call your health care providers office for a call back or to make an appointment to see your doctor Best wishes to you Im sorry youre going through this and hope you have sought medical treatment Unfortunately its impossible to diagnose a condition like this without a physical exam Many conditions can cause the symptoms you describe A medical professional needs to see this and possibly run some additional tests in order to figure out whats going on Meanwhile be extremely careful not to touch surfaces or other people while the rash on your hands is active Wear light gloves if possible to keep from spreading whatever this may be to others I hope you get a diagnosis and feel better soon I suppose its possible can be very painful and Im sure it might feel as if the pain is radiating down the neck to the shoulder However the pain youre describing could be caused by many other conditions including muscle strain  or even possibly  The only way to tell whats causing your pain is for you to get an examination by a medical professional If your pain doesnt clear up or if its accompanied by a fever Id suggest you contact your primary health care provider for an appointment to find out whats going on Hope this helps Im sorry to hear youre going through this The fear of having cancer must be very tough for you to cope with Im glad to hear you have a mammogram scheduled That is a good starting point and it sounds like your health care provider is on top of your situation While you wait try to remember that worrying will only cause you misery and can even have a negative impact on your immune system Look for support from family and friends Try to distract yourself Focus on the many positive things in your life no matter how small they may seem If you can try to get a massage or otherwise pamper yourself to relieve your excessive stress Even though you have a family history of cancer its not a sure bet you have cancer too Its entirely possible your breast lump is benign noncancerous and that your other symptoms can be attributed to a virus or even stress I know its hard but try to work on reducing your stress level and staying as healthy as possible as you work through the process of getting a diagnosis Take care of yourself Im sorry to hear you go through this and if it helps Ill share this It happens to me too Some people are just naturally prone to flushing when theyre embarrassed angry or otherwise experiencing heightened emotions Have you ever noticed whether or not your neck flushes for no reason at all Mine does Sometimes I can just be sitting around minding my own business get up to go to the bathroom and notice my necks all red What the heck I dont know if theres any medical explanation for this Ive noticed personally that it seems to happen more in fairskinned people of north European descent It could simply be that flushing which is caused by increased blood flow just beneath the skin is more visible in fairskinned people I dont know If possible try to learn to live with this unique trait When people tease me about this I laugh right along with them I say things like Some people wear their heart on their sleeve I wear my emotions on my face If the anxiety aspect bothers you dont hesitate to seek counseling from a trained psychotherapist Anxiety can be managed through cognitive therapy talk therapy and medication if warranted A counselor also can help you cope with the embarrassment you feel about the flushing I wish you all the best as a kindred spirit Sorry youre going through this misery First lets not jump to the conclusion this is  though it certainly sounds like it could be Id suggest you see a medical professional for an accurate diagnosis As you know if it is shingles you may be able to take a prescription medication to help with the pain If its not shingles your health care provider may be able to provide you with treatment for whatever it actually is Try to refrain from pulling your hair out as this can cause permanent loss of hair in those areas Also remember shingles in the blister stage is contagious and can cause someone whos never had to come down with the illness To help avoid this make sure youre washing your hands thoroughly and often Also do not share any combs brushes or other personal hygiene implements I hope you get a diagnosis quickly I certainly understand her reluctance to seek medical attention when she doesnt have insurance Many communities offer free or lowcost clinics to people who are uninsured Maybe you can help her find one of these I think your daughter needs to get this checked out It may be completely benign such as a lipoma a fatty noncancerous tumor But then again it could be something more serious Certainly if your daughter has a fever or is experiencing unintended weight loss she needs to be checked out as soon as possible You might encourage your daughter also by reminding her the cost of an office visit is substantially less than the cost of an emergency room visit so why put off getting this thing looked at I wish your daughter all the best Im sorry to hear about your auto accident You obviously were lucky to survive The chest pain you describe could simply be caused by the rib fracture Ribs can take a very long time to heal A month isnt very long in terms of a rib fracture If the chest pain has gotten worse since your accident or if its accompanied by a fever over 101F racing heartbeat or shortness of breath then Id suggest you see your primary healthcare provider immediately or go to the emergency room These symptoms can be signs of an infection or a blood clot I hope this helps and wish you all the best in your recovery Whether or not you have insurance if you are experiencing any of these symptoms you must go to the emergency room immediately A crushing squeezing or burning pain pressure or fullness in the center of the chest The pain may radiate to the neck one or both arms the shoulders or the jaw The chest discomfort lasts more than a few minutes It can diminish in intensity and return Shortness of breath dizziness Nausea heartburn or upset stomach Sweating or feeling the chills A weak fast pulse An irregular heart beat Cold clammy skin or a gray color to the face Fainting or loss of consciousness Fatigue These are the symptoms of a heart attack  My purpose is not to alarm you but to inform you so that you can assess your symptoms and make an appropriate decision about what to do Even without insurance you can access health care in most cities If you dont know how to access free or lowcost care in your area call your local hospital or a crisis hotline They will be able to provide you with resources for free and lowcost health care so you can get this problem checked out Good luck to you First of all thank goodness you apparently dont have meningitis How scary In answer to your last question Yes I think the ER doctor should have explained to you exactly what to expect after your lumbar puncture In fact you should have received some sort of written instructions Beyond that I think they should have given you additional verbal information about what to expect due to experiencing six attempts Its possible the site is still sore because of multiple tries and because of hitting a tendon However if you begin to run a fever its time to seek medical attention Fever could be a sign of infection Lumbar punctures are performed under sterile conditions but infection can occur afterthefact I dont think four days of soreness at the puncture site is unreasonable but if youre concerned you might give your primary care provider a call It never hurts no pun intended to get these things checked out I hope you feel better soon psoriasis If so not to worry its quite treatable Not sure is a friend it could be your thyroid I would go to a walkin clinic to get it checked out ProActive is the best daily product to keep your skin healthy and clearer

depending on how the pain is and how much you can handle That was more then likely the pain Did they say it was near the hypo thalmus which regulates the bodys temperature It could be a Brachial Cleft Cyst Might appear small on the outside of the neck but is actually growing on the inside Mine required surgery to remove still have the scar and grew to the size of a softball by the time it was surgically removed Sorry for the continuation but I feel as much info as possible needs to be given There has been no change in diet exercise or schedule sleeping work etc There has been no added stress in life recently either No matter what time of day the pressure on the center of my neck not the side muscles as stated a thumb pressing up into my skull gives me a sort of orgasmic feeling as if I didnt know I needed relief More so it is the feeling of breathing 100 oxygen I work on aircraft oxygen systems and often test them The pressure on my neck gives the same sort of coming to or awakening that breathing 100 oxygen does During a Migraine this pressure point provides the most instant relief possible I have been to my military PCM numerous times now with no avail Also my healthcare currently isnt accepting offbase referrals Therefore I am not able to see a Neurologist or a radiology center fora CT scan Thanks in advance for any help provided J You could be experiencing bone spurs in your neck It is very painful can come and go and the severity can vary Turning your head a certain way can cause a flare up You should start with a simple xray then if that doesnt show the answer then proceed with an MRI Yes it could I am experiencing the exact same thing I am 53 and never had Migraines in my life until I was involved in a car wreck and hit my head I now get Migraines frequentlysometimes 23 a week You need to see a physician about this IMMEDIATELY When I have my pains it is in the middle of my back It doesnt start on the right or left It starts where my spine is and moves around to the front to where it hurts to breathe and move The only thing that helps me are two bags of ice for my back and just under my ribcage and either 2 alieves or 2 midols I had to checked out and was hooked up to a machine and everything They said it was my breathing but I cant remember if that was exactly the case I lost 41 pounds but I could still feel the start of it but I would take medicine before it could go any further Hi First you should know what causes cancer One of the major things is tobacco smoking or genetic mutation from your DNA I recently just got over Pneumonia myself and according to my discharge papers it says that if you develop neck pain or stiffness that you should contact your doctor immediately I had a little bit of both but I believe mine was from the bed rest I would call your doctor and ask what they think you should do Hope you feel better soon it could be the left tonsilLook at it with a flashlight by looking at the throat If you see anything white white dots they need to see a doctor That is usually a sign of Strep Throat which can be extremely dangerous if not treated right away with antibiotics If the tonsil looks healthy then it could also be a lymph node I do recommend getting another doctors opinion It does seem like something that needs to be further evaluated However I would not assume he needs to see an oncologist just yet I recommend seeing another primary care pediatrician and going from there There is always a risk with anesthesia however the chances of things going wrong are slim for healthy children Children of young ages get anesthesia every day for procedures like this one I myself had it when I was just 6 months old and again at 7 years old for surgeries and all went perfect It sounds like it would be a good idea to get it removed especially since the surgeon is reassuring that there is a very slim chance of things going wrong Have you seen a doctor for this That is a very long time to go on with this and not see a doctor I recommend going to see one asap It sounds like Mono or Epstien Bar Virus They can cause each other thogh because I had both in Summer 2012 and I still got the swollen lympnodes If you get these from Mono they can last up to a yearnot suppose to but I do and to tell you the truth I think I am getting it again but a whole lot worse Mono can lead to Lymphoma same symptoms as Mono and I know that because my ex did and well I know I got Lymphoma or Mono again but anyways if you got Mono there is no treatment for it the only thing you can do is get a lot of rest and take some over the counter pain pills and you cannot do hardly any physical activity because when you have Mono your spleen gets swollen and if you fall you could rupture your spleen and the result for that is Hospital for a while Mononucleosis Symptoms Pain or discomfort Enlarged or swollen glands Fever Excessive sweating Night sweats Skin rash Sore throat Yellow skin Yellow eyes Decreased appetite Fatigue Headache Tenderness to touch Weakness generalized Swollen tonsils Tender glands Unable to blink or close eyelid Yes There are nerve roots between the bones that connect each vertebra If you have a slipped bulging andor herniate disc depending on which way the disc pushes it can affect any nerve that leads to the head andor anywhere else in your body and cause pain Might be gall bladder Median nerves symptoms can be caused by problems from the neck all the way down to the hand In some cases there are problems with the nerve itself and with the mylien covering You really need a more complete workup to determine the cause of your median nerve neuropathy rather than at face value assume its a problem with the carpal tunnel Some patients due require rerelease of the carpal tunnel or local flap to cover the median nerve depending on the problem if the workup reveals the cause of your symtpoms localize to the carpal tunnel region My son had problems with his lymph nodes swelling and after the fear of lymphoma we found out that the cause was infection Hopefully your outcome will be something easy to fix Enlarged lymph nodes in the neck and jaw area can be caused by several conditions If lymph nodes persistently remain enlarged after several weeks doctors usually consider a workup to help determine the cause Work up can include physical exam lab tests xrays and sometimes biopsy of an abnormal lymph node Some infections that commonly cause enlarged lymph nodes are strep throat mononucleosis cytomegalovirus toxoplasmosis tuberculosis and HIV infection There are many more possible infectious causes Some cancers cause enlarged lymph nodes such as head and neck cancers and lymphoma There are several other medical conditions such as lupus amyloidosis and sarcoidosis that can cause lymph node enlargement Certain medications can lead lymph node enlargement as a side effect It is best for your brother to follow up with his doctor who can evaluate the need to do further workup if lymph node enlargement persists Here is a link to an article about enlarged lymph nodes httpwwwwebmdcomatozguidesswollenlymphnodestopicoverview Take Care I

tight legs straight Helpful tips be sure to look straight ahead in this case your looking at the floor directly beneath you This keeps your cervical spine in a neutral position If this bothers your wrists perform them with your elbows bent and your forearms flat on the floor as fatigue sets in dont tighten your neck muscles by clenching your jaw this might irritate your neck repetitions 3 times 30 seconds 2 Side Planks Starting Position Lying on your side with your legs straight and stacked one on top of the other your hips flat on the floor elbow bent The elbow is directly underneath the shoulder and the forearm is flat on the floor Exercise Raise your hips and legs off the floor at this point the only thing in contact with the floor is one foot the other is stacked on top of the one supporting you your elbow and forearm The free arm can either remain resting on your side or you can raise it ou to form a tposition Hold for 30 seconds then rollover and perform lying on the other side Helpful tips just like with planks keep your cervical spine in a neutral position by looking straight ahead 3 Crunches and Situps Many times these exercises can still be done in folks with neck problems However there are 3 key points to keep in mind 1 Dont clasp your hands behind your head Many times as people tire they begin pulling on there head to bring their body upirritating the neck 2 Fold your arms across your chest or keep them straight at your sides this will stop you from pulling on your neck 3 Really concentrate on leading with your upper back and torso versus your head The abdominal muscles are responsible for flexing your torso not the neck By concentrating on using your abs you can keep your neck in a neutral position 4 Knee Tucks on a stability ball Starting Position Assume the position I described in the first plank exercise your shins are now resting on the top of the stability ball Exercise Tighten your abdominal muscles and slowly draw your knees towards your chest Pause then return back to the starting position with your legs straight Helpful Tips Exhale as you pull your knees towards you Keep your neck in a neutral position by looking down at the floor 5

shooting pain fullness difficulty swallowing pulsations swishing sounds in the head dizziness or lightheadedness and lymph node gland swelling Neck pain can also be associated with headache facial pain shoulder pain and arm numbness or tingling upper extremity paresthesias These associated symptoms are often a result of nerves becoming pinched in the neck For example compressing the nerve of

You may have strained your neck more likely than any kind of spinal injury but conking your head could have resulted in a bruise on the brain  thats what a concussion is and you dont need to have lost consciousness to have one I had a number of concussions that were not treated in the past and regretted it Its better to check it out than to be sorry After all your brain is the most important organ in your body A promptcare location or your local ED should check out your head and neck In the meantime put some ice in a baggie and rest it gently against your head Keep your head elevated Dont take any meds that could fog your head and make a diagnosis difficult Good Luck No If you still have those symptons you need to go see your doctor If they have gone I would worry unless they come back Good luck I have had the same symptoms It could just be a pinched nerve or disc damage To find out for sure youll need to see an Orthopedist Neurosurgeon or Neurologist and get an MRI I had surgery for mine and was pain free the next day c4ncer It could be a pinched nerve or God forbid an aneurysm PLEASE see your doctor or go to the emergency room immediately This is NOT something you want to take any chances with You are the best advocate for your health take advantage of that and take care of any problems that come up with your health  and take any preventative measures to make sure you stay healthy Wrinkled necks have to be treated much more delicately much more carefully because there is a little greater risk of problems because the neck skin is thinner It doesnt heal as well it doesnt regenerate as well The facial skin is fabulous pretty much got that down were kind of still at the frontiers at what to do with the neck and the upper chest from sun damage and aging But a combination of bleach creams low intensity laser like treatments like intense pulse light which is popular and its good because its safe but you have to have a series You cant expect it to be one blast and have the job done as when we do the chemical on the face when its a one time treatment But typically over a period of a year with 5 or 6 treatments and they are quick they are office visits in and out no down time virtually no discomfort add a little bleach cream into the mix and that skin will look better Not as perfect as the best result from a chemical skin peel on the face but were working on the neck Perhaps Redness and swelling are signs of infection or inflammation so it would be wise to see your medical provider to determine the reason Inflammation can be caused by the suture material but your biggest concern would be a wound infection Infected wounds can quickly get out of hand so do not delay in getting this properly examined It is a problem if you do not know the CAUSE of your symptoms Rather than try and figure out what you have or worry about having a heart attack it would be best for you to be examined by a medical professional  someone that can take a thorough medical history examine you order an diagnostic tests and give you the true answer Unfortunately this is not something that can be done blindly over the Internet That is really up to you I dont have enough information about the type of pain severity location duration of the pain your age etc to really make that decision for you The only way you can get this problem properly evaluated to SEE your medical provider I see no point in waiting at all As much as I would like to help you you cannot be blindly diagnosed over the Internet by providing a list of vague symptoms While I am sympathetic to your lack of insurance and financial constraints the ONLY way that you can get to the bottom of this four year old mystery is to see a medical professional  one who will perform a thorough medical examination and order some diagnostic lab tests Sorry There can be many causes for itchy skin but one common cause that can occur in those areas would be atopic dermatitis eczema Experts say that atopic dermatitis is not a rash that itches but rather an itch that rashes so itching is the primary symptom Of course when these areas itch you will scratch This can create an itchscratch cycle that can only be broken by 1 take an antihistamine like Claritin or Zyrtec to control the itching 2 reduce the inflammation by using hydrocortisone cream and finally 3 do your best not to scratch especially to the point where you may break the skin This will set the stage for a secondary infection and make things worse Yes it is safe Unfortunately no Triamcinolone will not help Bells Palsy Prescription oral steroids if taken early can help but the topical steroid creams will not have any effect on this condition Yes in my opinion Taking them out sooner 710 days depending on the size and location of the sutures would reduce the chances of getting a rail road track scar but if you are not the type of person that scars easily it may not be a big problem As long as those sutures do not get buried in the skin during those extra days you should be fine Thirteen days may not be ideal but it may be the best you can do I am guessing but are you traveling and may not be home to get them out eariler NoThere are no bursas in this area but you can get neck pain for a variety of other reasons and causes It would be wise to see your medical provider so that you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated Depends on how hairy you areif you were Sasquatch you could certainly have head lice on nonhead areas Mostly head lice live on the head occasionally the eyebrows and body lice live on the other parts including the clothing The pubic area can have pubic lice aka crabs I have no way of confirming or disputing this chiropractors diagnosis but I do have issues with the treatment plan Degeneration by definition is wear and tear often due to aging I dont believe it is possible to reverse aging by chiropractic adjustments but then again I am not a chiropractor who believes in those things Before mortgaging your house see an orthopedist for a medical opinion and have some imaging studies read by a radiologist I think you will find a different perspective on your neck and low back issues Yesthat would be one of the more logical possibilities to account for large reactive cervical lymph nodes I am glad you are seeing an ENT Zithromax will have no effect on influenza It is an antibiotic and this would only work for a BACTERIAL infection influenza is a virus The prednisone may have been for wheezing  Neither medication will cause swollen lymph nodes but your underlying medical issues whether it was influenza or not certainly can You would need to see your medical provider again to properly evaluate the significance of those nodes I cant examine you of course but these knots are most likely reactive lymph nodes  You would need to see your medical provider to determine WHY this is happening An Orthopedist would be the best place to start It cansome of the muscles of the neck attach directly to the skull This can cause a muscle tension type headache It is very difficult for me to comment on your case since I do not know any of the details including the reason for the antibitoics in the first place Not all swollen glands are bacterial so if you a a viral infection they would not help no matter what antibiotic you chose If you are getting worse it is up to your doctor to run some additional diagnostic test I think this would be better than just throwing another a 4th antibiotic at it without really knowing if the underlying reason justifies it Probably nothing at all You may have this extra hair genetically  but there is no reason for you to keep them You can wax em offpluck them outor see a specialist and have this extra hair permanently removed Most of these things are unwanted genetic gifts from your parents or grandparents but if you feel you are having a hormonal problem that is resulting in excess hair growth you would need to see your medical provider Migraines are vascular headaches and not all headaches are migraines Migraine does not mean a severe headache it is just one type of over a hundred different kinds of headaches The type of headache you may be describing is one of the more common typesa muscletension headache but the pain under the breast is not a typical symptom Muscletension headache can certainly come from the neck Since you cannot be blindly diagnosed over the Internet I would suggest that you see your medical provider for a proper examination Those problematic moles can be surgically removed easily by your medical provider if they do this type of procedure or a dermatologist There are many methods to do this but most are either a shave biopsy or an excisional biopsy Larger ones may require a tiny stitch or two smaller ones may just be cauterized This is definitely not something you can do a home The moles will then be sent to pathology to be tested to make sure they are benign There are no nonsurgical ways of removing them Sometimes This is called referred ear pain Because of the muscle connection from your neck to the area behind your ear the mastoid area pain in this sternocleidomastoid muscle can cause pain to be referred to the ear Pain can also be referred to the ear from problems in the mouth TMJ lymph nodes salivary glands and throat so if you are having problems in any of those areas please see your medical provider so you can be properly examined Dont forget that ear pain can also be a problem IN the ear too I can address your BPPV concerns but unfortunately it is not possible to predict how long you might have symptoms assuming you were correctly diagnosed BPPV has an annoying habit of coming back BPPV is an inner ear problem It does not cause palpitations or head rush and is not related to neck disorders so these symptoms are not likely associated Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo BPPV is the most common cause of vertigo The patient usually has episodes of recurring vertigo lasting several minutes or as brief as 15 seconds Specific movements of the head often provoke the attack usually following a brief delay of several seconds People quickly realize the specific head motion or motions which tends to trigger an attack There are effective treatments but you may need to see an ENT xmlnamespace prefix  o ns  urnschemasmicrosoftcomofficeoffice op sizsetfalse sizcache054537445470053730071828182845905 46 23 op You are most likely getting hives Hives can be caused by the temperature change that you mentioned You can try taking a longacting antihistamine before these warm season exposures loritidine Zyrtec Allegra to see if it helps Urticaria caused by temperature changes may not be prevented by antihistamines however but it is worth a try Keeping your skin surface cooler would also seem to be a reasonable preventative wearing clothing that breathes I cant comment on the accuracy of his diagnosis since I cant examine your child but a threeyear old who has been vaccinated with the chicken pox vaccine can certainly get painful shingles It doesnt happen very often but I do see this several times a year in my busy clinical practice Maybe but it depends on which fingers are involved The nerves to the hand arm and fingers does originate in the neck Then get an opinion from a MEDICAL DOCTOR such as an orthopedist All you have now is your chiropractors opinion  someone who is getting some financial benefits from keeping you under care for a long period of time If you have osteoarthritis chiropractic is NOT going to cure you So see an orthopedist Have an MRI of your neck One form of vertigo could be caused by neckhead movements and that would be BPV benign positional vertigo but there can be hundreds of causes No it does not There are no rules in medicine that state a person can only have one medical issue at a time so you can have both but they are not related As you know I have no way of examining these mysterious red blisters over the Internet so I am at a disadvantage Hand Foot and Mouth disease will give whitish papules look like tiny blisters but are more firm on the PALMS of the hands SOLES of the feet and cankersore like lesions inside the mouth  What you are describing would not be consistent with Hand Foot and Mouth disease Maybe your doctor should refer you to a back specialist orthopedist for a higherlevel evaluation Musculoskeletal issues in the neck can be very complex so you will need a careful medical history thorough examination of your neckshoulders and most likely some imaging studies Dont ever worry about asking your doctor too many questions They are not working for freethey get wellpaid to address your concerns Whiplash involves the neck not the lower back You will need to see your medical provider again so that the back can be properly evaluated Unless your friends are psychiatrists I would not trust their diagnosis of you being crazy I cannot give an medical explanation as to why your elbow cyst causes you to have neck spasm but I can tell you that nerves from the neck do go to your elbow area See your medical provider so you can have this socalled weird cyst properly diagnosed A bulging eardrum can cause vertigo due to the pressure This usually means a middle ear infection but cephalexin would not be my drug of choice to treat this in an adult although I dont know your dosage or medication history The medicine probably is not your culprit but rather your ear disorder Vertigo is also common in INNER EAR infections and these are often viral Viral infections do not respond to any antibiotic therapy Since I have no way of knowing your diagnosis or severity of symptoms you will need to consult your medical provider if you are not getting better I have to see your MRI to really make that call Personally I have to TWO rotator cuff repairs both failed and may be facing a third surgery in the future Each persons injury is really unique so it would really be impossible to blindly know if you need surgery or not unless I was intimately involved in your case I dont even know your age or how this incident occurred I can tell you that orthopedists are surgeons and surgeons do like to perform surgery Your cortisone injection was most likely for inflammation and pain so I hope that helps but it will not fix a complete tear The legs are only ONE problem when there are suspected peripheral artery disease A more critical artery would be the carotidsthe two main blood supplies to the brain The neck Doppler is to make sure the carotids are patent Contact dermatitis is a itchy rash caused by CONTACT with some allergensoap detergent perfume plant etc Eczema atopic dermatitis is geneticallydry skin They can both be treated with topical steroids like you are using but it can take a while to get it under control Contact dermatitis will continue to bother a person as long as the unidentified allergen is around Eczema can last a lifetime No This type of laser will not cause any problems with your vocal cords Get a paper tablet and write one thousand times I will not mess with a pimple in my ear every again Then call your medical provider explain the situation You will either be prescribed an oral antibiotic over the phone for the infection you most likely caused or you will need to be examined firsthandand then prescribed an antibiotic Maybe this could be a delayed drug reaction perhaps from the antibiotic course or this could be hives to something entirely different You will need to discuss this with your medical provider  someone who knows you the details of your care and someone that can examine you firsthand There is probably little or nothing that can be done medically to make you grow facial hair If those hair follicles were not present when you were born you cant grow new ones It is too late to change your parents and genetics so the amount of facial hair that you have now is about all you will get I dont think that medicines used for patchy baldness in men will work the same way on your face but that would be up to your doctor or a dermatologist to determine Testosterone a male hormone can cause some facial hair growth in men how are low but again if you do not have those follicles it may not help Your first step is to see a dermatologist There are more things that can cause neckback pain than scoliosis so I would suggest that you see a medical provider orthopedist for a consultation and higherlevel examination Neck pain is usually NOT solely related to scoliosis Having a comfortable bed is always good no matter what the reason for you back pain but you would have to try various mattresses and pillows to find the best combination for you What works for one person will not likely work for another My son is biracial and his dr said that its just his tyroid gland that its ok that they are swollenjust as long as there is no painHe said that alot of boys get it Hi to both of you and I too am concerned about my wife Debra who is Type 2 seven rods in her back Dvt in her legs going thorough menopause has alllergies and she has all things that you have been experiencing You have to look at everything I tell my wife Debra to invesigate everything and find out what works for her and her Doctor said too that everything was fine I told her to research her Metformin and she decreased it by 1000mg a day Guess what she has never felt better all because she has been losing weight Everybody needs to adjust things in this life We also need to look at other things and it may be or not the problem like weather flu colds nurtition Try theses Immune Boasting Foods Elderberry Button Mushrooms Acai berryOystersWatermelonCabbageAlmondsGrapefruitWheat germLow Fat YogurtGarlicSpinachGreenBlack Tea Sweet Potato and Broccoli and my favorite beets My Wife just said it could be stress and or associated the nerves so the BVitimins would be area to start I have to go Bye Steve  Debra You probably need to take your ass to the doctor before you get Alzeimers in your sleep and throw up everywere and dont know what the hell your doing It sounds to me like it is muscular skeletal But there are a number of conditions that could cause those type pains One could be related to a spinal condition but it could also be arthritic changes or Fibromyalgia You probably should see someone who will evaluate you for these issues Probably a Dr Who specializes in rheumatism or orthopedic conditions Tell your physician about it and he can send you to the right specialist You may be eating certain things that could cause this Spicy or hot foods are more likely all the time going to give you heart burn  and BBQ such as meats and sauces Although this may be something more serious  Possibly may be Heart Disease or a sign of a Heart Attack Please consult your Physcian for a correct diagnosis as I am not the most smartest person in the world Tinnitus can be a jaw joint or TMJrelated issue A dentist will do a complete examination which includes evaluating Changes in the degree to which you can open your mouth Deviations in opening and closing Clicks pops or pain A load test Xrays CT scans MRIs It also could be an ENT or neurological issue So you may want to see your physician for an exam as well I have tried heat and medications for the fibro flare ups but I dont know One option to consider is a chemical peel Dermatologists that are familiar with chemical peels use a combination of salicylic acid AHA and TCA to remove the top layer of the skin and encourage new skin growth Chemical peels can be very effective and are less costly than most laser treatments Neck lines and sagging neck are common complaints Most patients ignore their necks until they notice how aged their necks look The neck skin is fragile and requires more moisture than the face Just like you moisturize your face you should be moisturizing you neck Youll be glad that you did Plaque psoriasis needs to be addressed primarily by your physician Plaque psoriasis can be treated with topical and systemic medications There are also other treatments for plaque psoriasis without the possible side effects of systemic medications Hi I have this too and my doctor said it was due to a thinning disk in your neck vertebre and it was pinching a nerve She said nothing can be done cause it was from me having RA and just old age Im 54 I hope you get help with this I know its painful and I cant even sleep Sometimes the pain meds dont work Tamara Hi I have Rheumatoid Arthritus I feel that way all the time and also feel an achyness all the time But I think you should go see a Rheumatologist and he can tell weather you have Osteoarthritus or RA Or even if your doctor does xrays and blood tests they can tell I hope you get better soon Tamara yes This sounds like a pinched nerve or possibly nerve damage CATMRI will be required for diagnosis well i thought this was a place where people could get some answers but apparently not I have had the same problem The sleep number bed with the memory foam overlay is best Although the pillow you use may be more important You need a good one that cradles your head and is slightly raised at the neck area Sleep number can help with that too no possible infection of a tooth on that side or just simply your body actively fighting possible infection somewhere on that side how do you feel see any open soars tooth aches throat nose ear you should have finished them as your doctor advised you to Gargle with warm salt water and even gargle with hydrogen peroxide if the soars in your mouth do not show improvement I strongly suggest you seek medical attention to avoid further infection you most def already have and are battling right now I dont see any appropriate answer to this question besides keeping a close eye on the person mean while taking them to the ER They can be VERY serious and should be taken that way to avoid complications that could have been avoided keep them awake Here is a that should answer your question The longest it has taken during this outbreak so far is 42 days Regardless of what is causing the symptoms you list its worth calling your doctor and getting in to see him or her soon We hope you get to the bottom of this soon The

sweating anxiousness dizziness hunger weakness or fatigue headache and irritability High blood sugar includes being thirsty frequent urination  hunger blurred vision tiredness and nausea If you believe it is low blood sugar try to drink some orange juice or eat a candy bar and if it doesnt go away then contact your doctor although i do not believe that it could be a brain tumor You could be getting strep throat But normally if you are middle aged or older you will have problems with your iron levels Especially with you being a woman I believe that they are not connected symptoms but i did search the symptoms together and the most common diagnosis is leukemia I believe that if you did have leukemia it wouldve been caught a long time ago not just recently So i would just go to the

side effect My doctors have not heard of this side effect nor do they know what could be causing it The only thing I have found is that people with MS and Type 1 I have not been diagnosed with MS and I have Type 2 sometimes get neck pain but it did not explain why Im not sure my doctors actually believe this is happening I also had the same experience when taking Humolog Lantus and Levemir By the

bigger the bump smarter the person lol As one of member previously said light to throat and find any white or block dots if it is severe consult the doctor Most probably an impingement either on a tendon or other When blood flow is blockeddizziness quite common i would suggest tylenol and mucinex drink lots of water to thin out the mucus the tylenol will help with the other symptoms this could be a tension headache I have experienced the same thing  it is very scary The doctors attribute it to extreme acid reflux I am taking medication for the acid reflux and it helps however every now and then I eat more of a food I should eat in moderation  I overpower the medicine and once again have radiating pains in my chest throat and jaw Hope this helps  ask your doctor Good luck Neck pain is a symptom The causes can be muscular neurological or skeletal Have you seen a rheumatoid dr for testing It sounds like fibromyalgia which I have Mornings are the worst for me if you are female this could also be symptoms of heart problems such as coronary artery disease If you ARE STILL having these issues but only on an irregular basis I would definitely consult with a cardiologist I experienced the very same symptoms and only through my persistence and a caring doctor did he find that I had one artery that was 70 blocked While performing the angiogram the doctors also discovered I had an artery behind my heart with a 99 blockage and of course they fixed that first I had no idea something as simple as a painful neck such as the typical stress related pain could possibly be heart related in any way It then started to cause pain in my elbow and I thought I had twisted it doing something I received about 3 injections in it before the I started to experience other aches and pains normally attributed to aging issues but at 60 years old thought I was just showing more signs of the aging process I was fortunate enough to find a doctor that knew something had to be happening so I went through many tests that would always come back as normal although the symptoms remained The worst part was that I would never have consulted a heart specialist for any of my symptoms had another doctor ask me if I would mind seeing one of his colleagues A heart doctor for neck and elbow pain I thought it couldnt do any harm and when all tests came back as normal I thought I was wasting my time until they suggested an angiogramand I have to admit I was just as shocked as they were when they discovered the hidden blockage behind my heart that did NOT show on any of the tests they performed on me If you are female see a cardiologist and dont wait Check with your ENT could be something to do with the sinus My dr had told me it is normal to feel like that and symptoms of strep is swollen neck and lymph nodes I know i felt like i got hit by a truck for two days You Should See a doctor Just Because Its The Neck and the Spinal Cord area See a Doctor To Make Sure your Fall didnt damage any nerves it could be menopause some medications cause numbness some meds cause numbness You may have strained your ocular muscles I fell down the stairs in November and strained all my muscles Didnt know why my eyes hurt until February Dont wait get checked out I lay on the edge of the bed on my back Hubby stands next to bed and pulls me towards him if your husband is tall you can use pillows to adjust height My husband has a bad back and this is a good position for him alsofor oral sex I sit on the floor or pillow with my back against the bed This supports my neck get second opinion from nerophysician I do that all the timeeven in bed GO SEE A CHIROPRACTOR I wouldnt want to live without one since I started seeing one Usually a quick adjustment to the neck is all it takes Also ice packs to the area help with the pain It sounds similar to some sensations I get from FibromylagiaIf the sensation is like a burn and it makes it hard to move your muscles sometimes I would do some research on other fibromylagia symptoms and see if it matches up Good luck This also happens to my girlfriend the doctor told her she needed more iron in her blood this worked but whenever she stopped taking iron pills she got dizzy and had headaches again so probably a good diet with lots of iron Sore swollen neck near my wind pipe on my left side i do not have a herniated disc no  My right side shoulder has pain that makes it hard to turn my neck I think its kinda permenant  but try exfoliation and use an emolient  its one of those changes that happen after pregnancy this could be psycogenic with her going through menopause  but doctors should also have some lung investigation some lung disorders cause pain thats radiated to the abdomen I have had tendonitis and bursitis in my shoulders for several years now causing pain in my shoulders neck and upper back I get severe headaches lightheadedness and dizziness that according to my doctor and chiropractor are directly related to the pain I have in my shoulders From my understanding it is pinched nerves that actually cause me to get lightheaded and dizzy It is important to note that I also have neck pain stemming from a side to side whiplash injury from an auto accident 12 years ago I believe its one of those questions which came first the chicken or the egg So Im curious if you also have neck pain IF you have neck pain from an accident or injury I would definitely recommend getting seen for that as well I would also recommend seeing either a neurologist or an orthopedic surgeon or both to see if there are any remedies for the cause of your pain I just had an arthrogram done a specialized MRI on my shoulder and have finally discovered that I have several large bone spurs on my shoulder rotator cuff and collar bone that surgery can fix I am NOT a person who jumps into surgery but after years of suffering I and my doctors feel that it is the last option available to finally get some relief I wish you good luck in finding the cause and hopefully a remedy for your pain and lightheadedness I am a FIRM believer that pain is our body telling us that something is wrong and we should NEVER ignore it This sounds like either pinched nerve in your neck or maybe even fibromyalgia You need to get this checked out It can be caused by many things I had vertigo from a medication I was on once The ER doctor asked me if the room felt like it was spinning or did I feel like I was spinning He explained that usually if the cause is from the neck up inner ear ear infection etc you will feel like the room is spinning and if the cause is from the below the neck such as cardiac issues you feel like youre spinning Some of your symptoms are also those of diabetes If the room is spinning you can take Meclizine OTC check with a pharmacist if you are taking other medications If the problem is inner ear or an ear infection this should help your symptoms If it doesnt help or your symptoms get worse you should probably see a doctor to rule out more serious conditions sounds like swollen lympnoids sign of infection hUsBaNd wIfE dIvOrCe 919829717996 LoVe pRoBLeM sOlUtIoN bABA ji  hUsBaNd wIfE

dehydrate the crap out of me if I dont drink at least 814 big glasses of water a day which in turn causes painful headaches Thought maybe this could be a symptom of the dehydration as well I can consult with one of the physicians that I work with I just dont want to waste their time if this is just a symptom of being stressed anyone have any ideas thoughts opinions it depends does your doctor say you have osteoporosis yeah yeah i know it sounds like an old peoples thing but just ask your doctor do you have any redness in the throat or white patches in mouth this could be a symptom of strep throat my friends daughter has strep she had swollentender glands but also had rednesswhite patches in throat try Take care health at walgreens or minute clinic at CVS their prices seem to be reasonable Most services at walgreens are only 5999 I recently used walgreens for what ended up being a skin infection in the outside of my right earwhich only cost me 20 for visit and 5 for prescription since I had insurance without would have only been 89 for visit My son went through this same thing when he was younger the doctor ran all sorts of tests and did the IV antibiotics and no change If your daughter is sleeping a lot along with the other symptoms have her doctor check for mono disease This is what my son was diagnosed with and it took a month and a half after diagnoses for it to go away Also try the mixture of ibuprofen and Tylenol together for the fever I hope she feels better soon Good luck Alcohol can cause high blood pressure and high blood pressure does make you look and feel flushed Do you have any kind of a rash Like pimples or blisters If thats the case It might be shingles You can go for following exercises that are given below  Press Ups  pressup exercises are helpful for leg and back pain Lie on stomach with your arms bent and palms on the floor Extension Exercises  Lie on your stomach with the arms and legs stretched out Raise one arm and the opposite leg holding them in this position for 3 seconds Lower them to the ground repeating the same movement with the other limbs CurlUp Exercises  The curlup exercises strengthen the abdominal muscles which will provide support for the back relieving the pain Leg Raise  The leg raise exercises are beneficial to strengthen the lower abdominal muscles which can support the back and diminish the pain Leg Lifts in the Water  Water exercises are also recommended if you suffer from sciatica pain The exercises ie leg lifts can focus on working the stomach muscles and provide a good stretch for the legs Hope you will get positive results Sometimes when they do a lumbar puncture it can cause some of the spinal fluid to leak a bitI know it happened to me and it caused me to have a headache for about a week afterwards I just treated it as best I could and eventually the symptoms went away However if youre still suffering after a week I would go to your regular doctornot the ER Tell him what you had done and let him know what symptoms youre still experiencing That way he can see what the results are from your previous tests and maybe order more accordingly Good luck  \t \t \t \t \t

is the source of your neck pain If it is your muscle around your neck you can massagestretches to it and apply heat If it is your bone you should see a chiropractor can you describe the neck pain otherwise you must have strained your neck somehow if you didnt injured them as you didnt get hit on the neck then how is your posture go see a doctor you are probably going to have to have a x ray done i have the same difficulty and have found that mine is from degenerative disc disease However ive yet to find a way to stop them and i have had mutiple cervical neck injections massage pt and on and on Mine probably stems from a whiplash in the 70s massage and pt do help a little You have to make sure that you are properly washing your ears everyday with mild soap and water You may also apply some topical medications that you can purchase over the counter I strongly advise you to see a dermatologist as soon as possible Taking care of our skin is undeniably our great responsibility so you

emotional and or physiological sensations from the accident Look at Traumasomacom Dr Scaer is an expert on Trauma and his information may give you some insight and direction for treatment Peter Levine is also a top expert in this area Plenty of videos on YouTube also Good luck this is a case cevical spondylitis which mean iflamation of the cervical spine no Talk to your doctor about the symptoms you are experiencing If they cant find a common medication they could make a combination medication to target all of your problems It could get expensive though just be mindful Insurance companies do not like to pay for compound medications And not a lot of pharmacies do these kind of medications but none the less it is possible Not everyone is the same nor does everyone respond to the same things So discuss your options vigorously with your doctor My experience was an allergic reation to an antbiotic I was eventually diagnosed with exfoliative erythroderma It took a about two months and a ten day hosptal stay to get that diagnosis The longer no action was taken the worse the condition got My reconmendation is to persue this untill you have a finite action plan My diagnosis came from a dermotologist that was recomended and arranged by my allergy and asthma doctor Treatment was long over a year and I experienced many complications i have chronic mononucleosis and have all these symptoms but i usually have a fever for about a week before i have another attack I think you will be okay Its not like you actually had their blood on your hands and Ive never heard of blood dried on paper harming anyone Take a deep breath you are going to be okay I suffered from vitiligo for three years It first grows out on my neck and then spreads to my face which makes me look awful I dont like the way that strangers look at me I tried many treatments such as laser surgery to remove it but it really just can cure the symptoms on the surface months later I found it still grows out on my neck This really bothers me and makes me lack of confidence However things turn better when one of my mothers relatives in China told me to try some Chinese herbs He invited us to go to China to receive the treatment First i just want to have a trip which i thought will makes me feel happier On the other side I dont believe those Chinese Traditional stuff sounds like witchcrafts to me However magics really happened on me After the treatment I do get better now They use some secret prescriptions from the ancient time and pure Chinese herbs that dont have side effects Anyways I m so glad to share this story with people that have same problems like me Hope you can have a try too Here is some information about this hospitalwebsitehttpwwwvitiligotcmcom emailcurevitiligoaliyuncom Could be Migraine however check with your doctor just to be sure and safe Thanks I had the same symtoms Mine started behind my right ear then in my neck and shortly later in my shoulder and down my arm But after a year pain started on my left shoulder and arm My hands and fingers started going numb and tingling My first MRI showed a little disc bulge Couple of years later the MRI showed stenosis I had surgery Helped but a year and half later I got internal scar tissue and I have stenosis from that which is displacing the spinal cord So now Im worst than I was So good luck Also an MRI always doesnt show the problem until it becomes bad I think there are other tests that can help Or maybe you need another pathogist to read Your MRI AND see a Orthopaedic specialist and get on a payment plan It could be a number of things Since it includes difficulty to swallowing I wouldnt keep putting it off Get it checked out I dont think ENTs will bill you they will more than likely want to pay up front and that can get expensive At least the ER will bill you If it bothers you to swallow that tube is right by the tube you use to breathe  Tension headachesmigraines and if they are bad enough they could cause nausea and vomiting and sensitivity to light Migraines can be one sided Massage therapist or chiropractic visits are helpful Putting ice packs to the back of the neck is also helpful I find sitting up in my recliner in a dark room is more helpful than lying down you may want to look into Vertigo my mother was just diagnosed with this and had a lot of the same symptoms Shell go for days without an episode then all of a sudden shes dizzy off balance and she ended up hurting herself fairly badly when she fell and hit her head Id suggest going to the doctor asap if youre able Possibly Irlen Syndrome also known as Scotopic Sensitivity Syndrome Self test at irlencom you can also look up screeners in your area to find out The main answer that I can think of is its your nerves It can be just stress related Have you been under more stress the past two or more months You could be suffering from anxiety andor depression and not even realize it No that does not mean that you are psychotic or look and behave just like the people in those antidepressant commercials either If you look those conditions up you may find many symptoms that match not just your pain but possibly other symptoms you may be experiencing too There is also the possibility that it could be nerve pain I suggest that you take some time to think about not just the pain you are feeling but also what other problems are you experiencing You should talk to your doctor about the pain and anything else that is bothering you andor maybe causing you to behave unusual to others around you You may also be having problems with circulation You should just go see your doctor an if youre the type to forget what you thought about wanting to ask then think about what you want to ask and discuss the day you set the appointment write it down or even write down everything you want to say and bring it with you Well I hope you do find out what is causing you that discomfort and get some relief If you want to you can let me know what you found out it could be costochondritis which is difficult to diagnose it isnt life threatening just annoying ear nose and throat Vertigo is usually caused by to much fluid in the inner ear The main symptom of pleurisy is pain in the chest This pain often occurs when you take a deep breath in or out or cough Some people feel the pain in the shoulderDeep breathing coughing and chest movement makes the pain worsePleurisy can cause fluid to collect inside the chest cavity This can make breathing difficult and may cause the following symptoms Bluish skin color cyanosis Coughing Shortness of breath Rapid breathing tachypnea Pleurisy may develop when you have lung inflammation due to infections such as pneumonia or tuberculosis This inflammation also causes the sharp chest pain of pleurisyIt may also occur with Asbestosrelated disease Certain cancers Chest trauma Pulmonary embolus Rheumatoid arthritis Lupus COPIED FROMhttpwwwncbinlmnihgovpubmedhealthPMH0002347 dont know but if its giving him pain i would go see the doctor about it  may first make a call to the doctor he may tell you a few things that can help make it go away  has he had it long is he 100 sure that he wasent hit on the head  you know boys will be boys  i think only if he has pain is it really something to worry about  hope this helps your mouth is full of nerves and just because you have pain in one place doesnt mean thats where its coming from i would make a check up with your dentest if it doesnt let up  and infection can live in your gums  which is very bad since it can cause an abcest which can go into the spin and brain if left untreated can lead to death  on the lighter side a little meds can clear that right up  hope you feel better and hope this helped  sound like it possible your having pinched nerves which when the area is stressed is iving you the numbness  the puffiness its possible because the area has some problem when you use it which its kinda hard not to causes the area to become swollen i think it something to get checked out by your doctor  neck pain really blows  i have a reversed cervial spine so i know how it can stop your whole life i would ask for a mri cause it doesnt sound like a bone problem  hope this helps depending on how bad it can go from headaches  toothaches blurred vision in very bad cases  inablity to focus  finfing it hard to think pain in your jaw due to something like your cervical spine not being in the right place ex reversed cervical spine which causes the bones to be as it says in the name reversed which i myself have and its very painfull after you spine curves more than a 20 degree angle in the wrong direction  also things like bad posture can cause neck pain  if you sit on front of a computer for a long tome each day i hope this helps you  sounds to me like you might have shingles check it out pronto The test would be conclusive at that time However the HIV virus can take some time before being able to show up on a test Getting tested again wouldnt hurt Once every 6 months to a year is ideal especially if you are continuing to have sex with sex workers I wouldnt freak out too much yet though Many things can cause swollen lymph nodes including a sinus infection I used to get headaches in my sleep too First its helpful if you are not dehydrated or still digesting food at 11 pm and beyond because your serotonin is produced then if you dont have food allergies and sensitivities biofeedback is a great way to get a full panel then I might recommend finding a upper cervical chiropractor NUCCCA is their title so you can look them up that way I feel great when I wake up now Hope that helps YES The fact that you are asking that question and you lost consciousness it warrants a trip to the ER I had a fall a month ago and hurt my neck and shoulders it was a fall down a rocky hill I have the shooting pain down both arms and into the fingers I have already waited longer to return to dr than I should have Based upon my personal experience along with my husband daughter and now hundreds of people that I have come to know through a variety of venues I am a professional counselor with 30 years of experience your symptoms can absolutely be attributed to persistent borrelia Lyme infection and perhaps coinfections I strongly recommend you review the International Lyme and Associated Diseases ILADS website for uptodate and accurate information Because of what comes down to what is now willful ignorance many doctors are poiltical hacks rather than physicians like the expert who gave you horrible advice on this forum may need to see Chiropractor mine does at times and one day Ill deep breath and pops on its on my advise would be go to the er if it doesnt get better because these can be signs of a stroke or something else Ive been a physical therapist for over 25 years For some reason people still think that massage and ultrasound is primarily what we use for treatment That may have been true 20 or 30 years ago but the therapists I know and have worked with in recent years do very little ultrasound especially for neck pain Most massage has been turned over to massage therapists as well We often use a lot of specific exercise techniques to stretch or strengthen the region manual techniques like joint mobilizations or manipulation etc We do use both mechanical and manual traction some electrical modalities dry needling taping and other techniques We also use heat or cold but to categorize what our profession does these days as heat ultrasound and massage what we disparaging call a HUM job is illinformed and insulting shoulder pain problems shoulder pain problems I had a positive lymph node on my neck one that is enlarged for at least a month and had it removed and biopsied The local small town pathologist told me I either had HIV cancer or lymesReally narrowed that down eh So he sent my node to Cornell University to the top lymph node doc in the country thats what he said and the report came back Toxoplasmosis Its a parasite thats harmless unless youre pregnant Im just saying the possibilities are many most are harmless Just make sure your specimen goes to a qualified pathologist Good luck  Well Im not an orthopod but a retired xray tech of 42 years Small bones like in the hands and feet start to mend produce new bone growth in about 7 to 10 days its evident on xraysIts called callus formation Its not mended but starting to evident on xrays Its considered a common event that small bones even ribs are pretty much healed in 23 weeks but they give you a few weeks more just for good measure Large bones in 68 weeks But per your question new bone growth is pretty much evident on xrays in as little as 2 weeks Im guessing if the bone fragments are in close proximity to each other Just my opinion Hope this helps Just opinion here but maybe its not bacterial or maybe its MRSA Have to consider viral or fungal infection If so then antibiotics would be ineffective Think outside the box Is this a person that has had numerous antibiotics thru their life Our society believes you should get antibiotics for everything whether they are indicated or not Maybe try antifungal or antiviral med if nothing else is working Immune system is probably compromised already so last ditch might be steroids Just thinking to myself Hope this helps Bless you Im not a medical professional but you should get to the dentist or doctor immediately The infection can spread to your eye or worse I have seen it happen Please get help now Let me say again not a node its doesnt swell or become soar if i get sick it has nothing to do with being sick its always there the same size just like the first bump i describes my final bump i just noticed the other day Its kind of under my tounge another word i cant spell or on the floor of my mouth but just where my hard gum line meets the soft floor of my mouthIt stick out a little bit and is annoying I looked online for a long time in search of my most recent bump but most of what i found there were multiple conjoining bumps Either way Im freaked out as I see some pretty crazy stuff online yet none of it completely descibes me try using more pillows to elevate your head so you do not have to resort to sleeping in recliner Maybe you should get your nerves tested I had a neck injury that was not visible from my MRI and CAT scans and was effecting my right arm I was feeling nerve pain down my right arm and tingling at my fingertips and also had weakness in my arm When I injured myself my spine pinched my nerve that runs down my arm Stiffness in neck when really bad cannot bend neck in any direction Feels swollen affects jaw and ears Causes tightness in muscles of cranium and pain and stiffness from area of neck near the base of cranium and spine  Very stiff and horrid pressure in mid to upper spine is a main contributor as well Hearing loss in right ear is almost completeLeft ear is losing hearing as well Every nerve on my upper torso muscular rigidity or atrophy happens in both shoulders with pain running under armpits causing numbness in both arms Confusion the inability to speak is very frustrating When I feel frustrated with this pain I cannot express any emotion almos like I am in a walking coma Nerves on my skin hurt so much it is painful to shower All the while my neck continues to stay stiff and feel like a knuckle feels when it needs to pop and sometimes the neck does pop but it isnt the bones that pop its the muscles that pop Right before they pop the muscles in the neck sound rusty Yes they make a sound like an old leather baseball glove would make if you opened or closed the glove Last but not least the taste in my mouth is horrendous It feels like the nerves in my mouth have been muted or are hurt stinging some way I dont know if the taste is coming from the drainage from my right ear Which gets filled with so muhch pressure the ear drum breaks chronically and then heals up until pressure gets bad again While the ear drum is still unbroken the drainage runs down my throat making my throat sore and giving me that horrible taste and stinging in my mouth  That I am not for sure of I have a friend that also has the same condition She says she gets pain in and around face and neck area tender and painful I want to believe she said does swell sometimes The ER here in MS was also not familiar with it They thought she said fibro and its not the fibro Not sure wh ya lot of places havent heard of it You may want to look it up on mayo clinic online May give you some better insight I know a doctor in I think was Florida was doing some kind or laser treatment without surgery My friend has said that they also call it suicide disease httpwwwmayocliniccomhealthtrigeminalneuralgiaDS00446DSECTIONsymptoms here is the link to symptoms right on site check it out is exactly how she described it to me Could possibly be sinus infection Take some of the new Advil allergy and congestion pills available Box is yellow and green says New at top Other than that possibly need to go to doctor or clinic or er Not sure if hay fever but I get the same feelings Advil allergy and congestion will work for hay fever too Better to try then not to You only get I think 10 pills for 600 and I buy them at DG store Dollar Store One every 46 hours as needed Try it other than that I dont know I fell that people experience anxiety in many different ways In your case one might say that the stress your homework can entail might subsequently trigger a specific chemically cranial process making you experience panic or anxiety due to the situation I would say that anxiety related to school is quite common I personally experience immense anxiety when I have to give presentations for schoolsomewhat a similar situation Hope I could help you out This is my first answer haha no I think you should get it checked or take a picture of it to see if it changes you should have saved the tick also watch for a bullseye shape mark that would be bad well you need to see your family physician first then shehe will refer you to whom ever they think is fit for you Are you female Over 40 or no ovaries Could be menopause  About 2010 I got a concussion when I fell while I was a patient in the hospital strangely enough I did not at that time have vestibular issues But I do now Its very frustrating when youre doing the PT for vestibular and still have the symptoms  I passed out without any warning Stood up and 30 seconds later passed out again Both times I landed on my face But I was unconscience before I even hit the floor Doctors were thinking it likely was seizures The last time I had a seizure was approx 1985 But I have been taking my medicine to prevent them for many years Could it be possible that switching to a newer drug Antivert may be to blame I dont know why my neurologist made me switch After all if it aint broke dont fix it According to him Dilantin is a very old medicine I have gone back to taking Dilantin But I am getting therapy for vestibular as a result of the episodes BTW is there a difference between dizzy and lightheaded  Hot flashes I a 48 yearold man get them I dont know if mine are caused by all of the bipolar meds that I take I would love to get an answer as well because I have been experiencing the same sensation for a few weeks I feel it in my upper chest near my neck face and ears Those areas get read and blotchy and feel hot to the touch It last a few minutes and then goes away It burns feels prickly and after a while slightly itchy The burning is the worst part of it because it feels like a terrible sunburn I sure hope we get some answer You might need a chiropractor to relieve the pins and needlesnumbness  If you are tired all the time get checked for lyme disease  I had it for years and did not know it until I could not move anymore  If you dont take omega 3s and 6s essential fatty acids you can become very tired so add this to your diet If you have had lyme disease and did not take antibiotics until you were symptom free it will return  I know it happened to me because I could not get treatment I needed because of lack of knowledge from infectious disease doctors  long term lyme disease required IV antibiotics to penetrate the underlying tissues  you need to see a lyme literate doctor who has success in treating lyme disease  wwwiladsorg Nerve damage in your neck Pulled muscles in your neck Either way if you are continually getting headaches you need to see your doctor I have this exact problem Good luck Here is a great slide show from the site that might help you identify it As I am not a doctor I wont even speculate on what injury or issue you may be having However you may try having an MRI done that was how I found out I had herniated the c5c7 vertebrae in my neck in a car crash since she is diabetic you have to rule out hypoglycemic headace get a GRBS tested if GRBS is less than 60 mg ask her to take some sugar or candy treatment for gastritis can also be given A neck xray can rule out cervical spondilitis  Seek medical attention now This could be related to a more serious condition rather than just a headache Because your headache presents itself when you lie down this could be tumor related I had the same symptom for 3 months When I finally went in and they did a CT Scan I had a Primary Brain Tumor You might have high blood pressure Have you had your thyroid checked I was having pain and stiffness right posterior neck and subscapular muscle spasms After taking 25mcgm of synthroid the pain stiffness and spasms went away It could be the mattress itself the positioning of your body whilst sleeping or the material the pillows are made from I would say to invest in another mattress or try sleeping somewhere else to see what happens Your neck is greatly affected by the positioning of your body The same thing happened to me and when I had an MRI done they determined that I had a herniated disc "}
