doctor and have it looked at I dont believe it would if you only do it a few times but if you keep doing it on a regular basis that would be cause for concern as it can lead to anorexia and other health issues Remember that your body needs the recommended daily dose of calories to stay healthy and fight off infections and to continue functioning properly It sounds like you have genital herpes or warts Have you had any flu like symptoms too Often times people with gential herpes will get flu like symptoms upon their first outbreak When someone with genital herpes has an outbreak sores will appear in their genital area including around the anus these sores will often cause extreme pain or discomfort especially when urinating Next time the sores appear have a doctor test them for the STD or you can get a blood test which might offer a more difinitive answer A thick white vaginal discharge without a smell is normal Hormonal levels affect the amount and color of your vaginal discharge Since birth control pills contain hormones it is natural that they will affect your vaginal discharge Some birth control pills contain higher levels of estrogen and some are progesterone only without estrogen If the discharge is bothersome it may be advisable to change to a different type of birth control The concern with your discharge is that it smells This could be a sign of an infection You should see your gynecologist about your discharge and discuss whether it is a sign of infection and whether another birth control pill would be better for you The estrogen in birth control pills lowers the acidity of secretions in your vagina and increases your risk of yeast infections A vaginal yeast infection usually causes a sore itchy vagina with a thick clumpy white discharge that has no odor and looks a little like cottage cheese As long as a vaginal discharge is not associated with pain itching discoloration or a bad odor it can be a positive effect A vaginal discharge helps lubricate the vagina for intercourse In women who are not on birth control vaginal discharge can indicate whether or not ovulation is occurring During ovulation women have an abundant clear wet and stretchy discharge Many women compare the discharge at ovulation to raw egg whites Dont know much about the calcium stuff But my doc put me on carafate it helps heal all the ulcers created by the reflux But it does wonders for your tummy too They are huge and you have to take 4 a day but once you feel how much better you can feel its worth it Depending on how bad the burn is you may want to buy Silvadene over the counter It is used for burns Your testicle probably had a negative reaction to something From my perspective its nothing serious but I would recommended that you visit your local doctor and get it looked at Hi if you are out of shape I wouldnt worry You will expierence pain in your chest and sides because it is new dear Nohardbut as far as I know yeast infection is heavy and tick and just like cheesebut my discharge is yellow and not tickdo you think that it is due to taking Yasmin Probably a very minor staph infection I get them all the time Sounds like it could be a yeast infection There are now creams available over the counter to treat that your blood pressure is to high you should stop eating so much sodium or salts and also stay away from pork and other salty meats  I suggest that your make an appointment with your family doctor Explain the symptoms and receive a physical exam of the affected areas The doctor may also run blood studies to rule out nutritional deficiencies Discuss the possibility of being referred to a sleep doctor I strongly suspect that you may be affected by the conditions called restless leg syndrome and periodic limb movement These disorders may begin in childhood and slowly progress as we age There may also be a genetic component associated with the conditions Check with other family members to see if they also share your symptoms The symptoms as you describe typically begin during the evening as you relax in bed As you prepare to rest and during sleep the burning feeling muscle tighteningcramping and leg twitching intensifies It is difficult to sleep due to the uncomfortable sensations and you may suffer sleep deprivation Symptoms may also occur while sitting during car rides Diagnosing RLS and PLM is usually accomplished through a sleep study Medications such as Mirapex and Neurontin are some of treatments employed to control these painful conditions Id almost bet the house that RLS and PLM are at the root of your discomfort With proper diagnosing and treatment with Mirapex and Neurontin you should see a marked improvement in the quality of your life  Yes what you are experiencing may be considered as normal It sounds like you are caring well for your injured finger Changing the bandages frequently and preventing infection is important You only had the stich procedure 72 hours ago The stiches will probably be removed within 710 days after their insertion The laceration needs time to heal properly usually about 34 weeks The affected area was damaged and swelling most likely is present As the swelling goes down the burning and pain will diminish along with any throbbing Perhaps you also sustained some superficial nerve assault which may take as long as 610 months to be resolved In conclusion The damaged finger should heal virtually incidentfree but needs more time than most people feel is necessary to recover from the injury Keep the area dry and clean to prevent infection by continuing to change the bandages take an analgesic every 46 hours for pain relief if not contraindicated do not overwork the lacerated area and have the stiches removed and the healing assessed upon your followup appointment Diagnosing your medical condition will require a through patient interview detailing past medical conditions confirming when symptoms first appeared family history age sex medications being taken pain quality describing your pain as burning after eating may suggest a gastric type of disturbance and a physical examination It can be a time consuming challenge to both you and your medical professional to eventually comeup with an accurate diagnosis One point to note is that some pain can be characterized as referred pain That is pain originating from one anatomical location but causing pain in another location A differential type of diagnosing technique may be employed and require more blood studies cardiac testing CT Scans Xrays and other testing Some common disturbances were addressed in the emergency room but a boatload of other possible medical conditions still remain Upper right abdominal pain can be caused by many medical conditions including Your symptoms will require the painstaking investigative work by a competent and methodical physician One by one all possible causes must be eliminated until only one remains It is great that you have an appointment scheduled with the doctor on Monday I can understand your concern but the best action to take until Monday is to relax take care of yourself and enjoy life The WebMD audience is knowledgeable but cannot confirm or deny your suspicions based solely on the information contained in your question Of course some of your symptoms could be as a result of colon cancer but could also be the result of some other GI disturbance Your situation is unique and deserves to be professionally assessed with diagnostic tools such as a colonoscopy blood testing and imaging studies The link below is from a WebMD article that describes colon cancer in greater detail httpwwwwebmdcomcolorectalcancerguideunderstandingcolorectalcancersymptoms  I wish you the best Running to the restroom more then 8 times a day skin is very itchy If it is shortly after you eat it sounds like gas bubbles try drinking a soda to burp it usually helps me Could be a urinary tract infection UTI Go see your doctor for a urinalysis or urine culture I was always told that milk makes ulcers worse yet when I suffered from them it was the only thing that gave me relief It could be a sinus infection  But if there is no other signs G I BLEED heartburn The primary approach to properly managing acid reflux should be to actively identify and avoid certain foods that trigger your symptoms Here are some of the common foods that can trigger acid reflux  Fatty foods  Acidic foods like citrus fruits or tomatoes and tomatocontaining products  Coffee caffeinated beverages or alcohol  Chocolate or peppermint  Spicy foods  Garlic or onions Also try to refrain from lying down after meals eating too much in one sitting eating less than two hours before going to bed or exercising or eating too quickly Quitting smoking and losing weight may also alleviate symptoms as well I would suggest journaling your dietary intake and activities each day so that you can notice any trends in what might be provoking your symptoms If you continue to experience acid reflux symptoms remedies might include over the counter products or prescription medication Certain alkaline foods may help to neutralize acid reflux too but its more important to prevent acid reflux from occurring in the first place by avoiding your triggers Consult with your doctor about long term treatmentmanagement options and visit the WebMD HeartburnGERD Health Center for more information httpwwwwebmdcomheartburngerddefaulthtm Using the fat burning mode on exercise machines at the gym actually isnt the best way to burn fat The key concepts to understand here are the percentage of calories that come from fat and total calories The fat burning mode is typically set at lower exercise intensity where more calories burned come from fat Not as many calories burned during higher exercise intensity will come from fat The point to understand though is that while more of the calories that you burn will come from fat at a lower exercise intensity you have the potential to burn more calories per session doing higher exercise intensity The percentage of calories burned from fat will be lower during the higher exercise intensity but you will be burning more calories overall including the amount of calories from fat Also higher exercise intensity leads to a greater boost in metabolism even after youre done exercising which burns additional calories Its best to do exercise that youre comfortable with and that meets your level of trainingconditioning In general however increasing the time spent on exercise and increasing exercise intensity will provide a greater potential to burn more calories and lose weight The primary approach to properly managing acid reflux shouldnt be in promoting certain foods instead of others but rather in identifying and avoiding foods that trigger symptoms Basically you shouldnt focus on what to eat but rather what to avoid In that regard here are some of the common foods that can trigger acid reflux  Fatty foods  Acidic foods like citrus fruits or tomatoes and tomatocontaining products  Coffee caffeinated beverages or alcohol  Chocolate or peppermint  Spicy foods I would suggest keeping a journal to write down your dietary intake daily so that you can notice trends and so that you will be able to identify potential triggers as you notice symptoms Also its recommended to refrain from lying down after a meal eating too much in one sitting or eating too quickly Quitting smoking and losing weight may also alleviate symptoms If you are experiencing acid reflux symptoms remedies might include over the counter antacid tablets or prescription medication Certain alkaline foods may help to neutralize acid reflux but its more important to prevent acid reflux from occurring in the first place by avoiding triggers Please visit the WebMD HeartburnGERD Health Center for more information The answer depends on many different things since your weight the type of exercise how intense you are doing each exercise and how long you do each exercise will all influence how many calories you burn Simply put however I would say that you have the potential to burn the most calories by running followed by biking and lastly by using the elliptical One way to measure how many calories you burn during exercise is to look at metabolic equivalents METs METs are a way to measure and gauge the amount of energy you burn during physical activity with 1 MET being equal to the energy you burn simply being at rest For instance running at a 10 minute mile pace is roughly the equivalent of 10 METs or ten times the calories you burn at rest Unfortunately there really is no good answer for how many METs you burn while using an elliptical A study entitled 2011 Compendium of Physical Activities A Second Update of Codes and MET Values only lists using an elliptical at a moderate intensity which was the equivalent of 5 METs For comparison bicycling with a moderate effort 12139mph is 8 METs You can find a comprehensive list of METs by doing an internet search for Compendium of Physical Activities Tracking Guide Websites utilizing a formula involving these MET values for each type of exercise along with your weight and the duration can help to estimate how many calories you will burn during exercise Keep in mind that these are just based off of averages but one such site is httpwwwwebmdcomdiethealthtoolfitnesscaloriecounter  Play around with the types of activities and the duration of the activity to see what can provide you with the most calories burned I too agree with  Please follow him and see Sounds like you may have a problem with your sciatic nerve This nerve is easily damaged The pain with a damaged sciatic can be in either one side or both of you buttocks and sometimes more often than not the pain reradiates down the back of your leg Taking Aleve or ibuprofen helps with the pain I usually use a heating pad or a ice bag to help with the pain and take Aleve and move around as much as possible Hope this helps Sounds like you may have the beginning stage of a sty Stys are normally found under the eye lid or along the eye lash area When I get a sty I take a small amount of rice and put it into a baggie and place the open baggie with a wash cloth under the baggie into the microwave heat it for one minute Remove the baggie and wash cloth seal the baggie then fold the wash cloth around the baggie this will be hot if you wish wrap another wash cloth around the baggie and first wash cloth to avoid burning yourself Apply to your eye to help with the swelling and help the sty to come to a head so it can pop on its own Do not try and pop a sty as this could lead to infection and a longer period of time to heal Allow the sty to pop on its own always If need be see your doctor if the swelling gets worse or is still swollen for more than a week If the burn covers over 10 of your body surface area or is blistering you should see a dermatologist or go to the emergency room immediately What you are describing sounds like a seborrheic keratosis which is a benign condition however this needs to be evaluated by your dermatologist who will be able to either treat the symptoms and reassure you or do a biopsy to send the lesion to the lab for further evaluation and treat it as needed If the burn covers over 10 of your body surface area or is blistering you should see a dermatologist or go to the emergency room immediately The key to enjoying cookouts is to know what foods agree with you If grease bothers you stick with grilled foods or vegetables Instead of tomatoes load up your salads with carrots beans jicama or other milder veggies Burgers are OK but get the leanest cuts and dress them with guacamole or something else less acidic than catsup If carbonated drinks lead to latenight torture stick with iced tea If Margaritas and you dont get along drink less or switch to a virgin strawberry type Watermelon can be acidproducing Consign it to a mixedfruit salad only Eat smaller portions Your stomach detects large amounts and pumps out more acid These are the foods that irritate a damaged esophageal lining and should be limited or eaten in small portions Citrus fruits and juices Tomato products Chili peppers Pepper Spicy food Its important when you are in an emotional state to try and eat balanced meals and snacks and keep yourself as well nourished as possible because not eating can make matters worse emotionally and physically  commonly are given to relieve pain in the joints such as the elbow or the neck The medication works by reducing inflammation which in turn can relieve pressure on a nerve and reduce pain A corticosteroid shot for joint or soft tissue pain should not cause any side effect like indigestion Generally speaking the medication stays in the local area of the injection and does not travel throughout the body Corticosteroids also can be administered by injection into a vein This type of injection is used to treat an allergic reaction or asthma While its unlikely this type of steroid injection would cause indigestion its not impossible If you received a cortisone shot for joint pain then your heartburn likely is not related Hope this helps No its not is a hormone made by a small gland in the brain Melatonin helps regular your sleepwake cycle It is sold as a dietary supplement for people who have trouble sleeping Some people say melatonin is helpful for getting over jet lag These claims may be true but have not been proven by good studies yet Im not sure what supplement you might be thinking of for your acid reflux but there are many overthecounter remedies available to you You can always ask the pharmacist for advice on what product might be best for you Some antacid products can interfere with medication absorption so its a good idea to check with your pharmacist or health care provider before choosing an antacid Wishing you well Im sorry youre going through this Its not uncommon to mistake one medication for another It happens to the best of us It sounds like you did everything right You flushed your eye and sought medical attention It would not be uncommon for you to have a dry swollen feeling in the lower lid after placing camphophenique in the eye You dont say how long ago this happened Its possible the situation will clear up You can continue lubricating the eye with plain saline eye drops such as Natures Tears brand Bausch  Lomb brand saline drops for sensitive eyes or any generic brand of sterile saline solution Do not use plain tap water as this will only irritate the eye further If the problem doesnt get better within a week of the time you sought medical attention you might make an appointment with an ophthalmologist a medical doctor who treats eye problems or your primary care provider to get reevaluated I hope you feel better soon Assuming you had this mole removed recently Id say the redness and itching are a normal part of the healing process As the body heals a wound in this case the one caused by having the mole burned off it employs several types of cells and chemical compounds to repair the skin layers that have been damaged During that process a chemical compound called histamine can be released Histamine can cause itching Along similar lines the redness can be caused by various cells and the bodys chemical response to the wound Its important you not scratch this patch of skin while its healing If you pull the scab off a scar can form Its OK to rub the area with the flat of your hand If youre concerned about scratching during your sleep put socks on your hands I know it sounds wacky but it will keep you from accidentally scratching your face with a fingernail while you sleep The itching and redness should calm down as the days pass If the redness and itching get worse you can put a call in to your doctors office and speak with the nurse to find out what to do Good luck Im so sorry to hear youre going through this Burns can be very painful and the healing process can be uncomfortable too Its important not to scratch or pick at the burn site while it heals because this can lead to scarring I hope the emergency room gave you some written instructions on how to care for your burn Here is a link to a WebMD article about  but this mainly refers to mild burns To your question if the itching is keeping you up at night and assuming youre a healthy individual you can try taking an overthecounter antihistamine such as Benadryl diphenhydramine It not only will calm down the itching but will make you feel drowsy Read the label instructions very carefully and take this only as directed I hope youre receiving followup care for your burn Please see your health care provider regularly until its fully healed Your provider will be able to provide specific instructions on how to care for your burn Feel better soon The short answer is No But this deserves a bit more discussion Heartburn is a pain that you feel around midchest and is caused by acid moving back up into the esophagus from the stomach This pain often will go away when you take an antacid product such as a chewable tablet like Tums or Rolaids or a liquid product like Maalox Despite its name heartburn does not involve the heart is a condition in which body tissue doesnt get enough oxygen usually due to decreased blood flow The term ischemia is often applied to the heart muscle but ischemia can happen to any muscle or even the brain When the heart suffers from ischemia it can trigger a pain response which is called angina This pain also occurs midchest like heartburn so it can sometimes be tricky figuring out if chest pain is a result of stomach acid heartburn or ischemia The two conditions heartburn and ischemia have different underlying sources and are not related except in terms of causing pain in the chest I hope this helps An endoscopy procedure is performed on an asneeded basis An looks at your esophagus stomach and upper part of the small intestine Upper endoscopies are routinely used to check for ulcers and  If you were diagnosed with GERD chances are your health care provider put you on some sort of medication to treat the condition Its important to take that medication exactly as prescribed If youre continuing to have symptoms even though youre taking your medication then you should talk to your health care provider again He or she may want to change your medication or add another medication to help control your symptoms Your provider may also want to repeat the upper endoscopy procedure to determine if you have other damage to your stomach or esophagus Its generally considered safe to repeat an upper endoscopy after 18 months I hope this answers your question Id suggest you consult a medical professional about this It could be something as simple as dry eyes due to the winter season but since these symptoms came on so suddenly and severely it also could be that you have developed an eye infection called  Until you can get this diagnosed be sure to wash and dry your hands thoroughly many times a day especially before touching your eyes If this is conjunctivitis its highly contagious Even if its not pinkeye you dont want to risk spreading any possible infection to others Hope this helps My best advice is rinse rinse rinse Try to rinse off as much of the chemical from your scalp as possible Experiencing a mild tingling sensation and some redness after applying hair color is not abnormal but its possible to get a chemical burn to the scalp if you leave the solution on to long or rub it vigorously into the skin Or of course if it turns out youre allergic If rinsing relieves the burning and redness Id suggest you wash your hair gently with regular shampoo and apply a conditioner The conditioner may help relieve some of the skin irritation Be sure to rinse the conditioner out of your hair after a couple of minutes If rinsing does not relieve the burning and redness you probably should see a medical professional Hope this helps Im sorry youre going through this is an unpleasant procedure and its worse when postsurgical symptoms linger on for so long I suggest you schedule a followup appointment with your surgeon As the specialist he or she is in the best position to evaluate your situation and make recommendations for treatment if any I think youve suffered long enough Recovery from hemorrhoid surgery generally only takes 24 weeks Why not give your surgeon a call for an appointment Wishing you all the best Oh ouch Sorry to hear you went through this The sacrifices we make to look good right It sounds to me from your description like the wound healing process is proceeding along a normal course That brownishyellowish goop you see likely is caused by an excessive number of protein cells The body tends to overcompensate a little when trying to heal a wound like this Unless you spike a fever over 101F and start feeling nauseated or something youre probably good to go Im sure your doctor gave you wound care instructions You dont need to scrub that goo off but you can cleanse the wound with cool soapy water and pat dry The silver sulfadiazine was a great choice for this type of burn That stuff is nearly miraculous in my opinion A thin layer is all you need Eventually this will wound scab over It sounds like you might have a scar from this burn If that concerns you feel free to consult your physician again after its healed for some options about how to minimize the scar All the best to you You need to see a gynecologist for an examination What youre describing could well be a sexually transmitted disease such as  One is small blisterlike lesions on the genitals The pimples youre describing may or may not be herpes but only a physical examination possibly accompanied by a blood test will tell You need to find out whats causing these pimples on your labia because theyre not normal Meanwhile you need to avoid having sex because even condom use wont necessarily protect your partner if you do in fact have herpes Thats because a condom may not cover all the areas of his skin that could come into contact with yours I hope you find out soon what is causing your symptoms and I wish you all the best Im sorry to hear your husband is going through this It sounds very distressing for both of you Despite the negative test results Id urge you not to give up Some conditions evolve over time and may take repeated testing to identify Id suggest you make a followup appointment with your husbands primary health care provider to discuss these symptoms and how theyve progressed  or swelling of the legs and arms often is occurs when the veins arent working properly to return blood to the heart Blood pools in the veins and some of the fluid component of the blood seeps into the surrounding tissue causing swelling Very often excessive salt intake contributes to edema Your husband might consider reducing his salt intake Read food labels carefully youll be surprised how much sodium is lurking in there Smoking cigarettes also can contribute to poor circulation especially in the legs If your husband smokes Id suggest he seek medical help to quit Hope this helps I certainly think you should see a doctor about this What youre describing sounds like very hard stool that is difficult to pass This possibly could cause a eventually It sounds like youve done some good things by eating plenty of fiber and trying laxatives You should also be sure to drink plenty of fluids to stay wellhydrated Some medications for acid reflux can cause  so be aware of that Your health care provider should be able to help you figure out if you have a serious constipation issue or if theres something else going on Either way a medical professional can help you treat this and get back to having comfortable bowel movements Best wishes to you Hm Im sorry to hear youre going through this Im going to assume you got a skin graft to cover the large burned area If this is the case remember you need to keep it wellmoisturized because it will not produce its own protective oils the way the rest of your skin does If youre not putting plenty of lotion or oil on the graft it could possibly respond in the way youre describing Regardless of whether or not you got a graft the fact youre having new symptoms in this old burn scar is worth a trip to the doctor Id suggest you make an appointment with either the health care provider who handled your burn at the time or with your primary care provider to have this looked at Meanwhile if youre not allergic to any medications youre probably OK to take some Benadryl diphenhydramine to calm the itching especially at night Diphenhydramine may make you very drowsy so use caution if taking it during the day I wish you all the best with this First welcome to Answers Second Id like to invite you to join  where you can connect with other people trying to lose weight Your current plan is unsustainable because youre burning more calories 1400 a day than youre taking in 1000 per day The numbers need to be reversed You need to take in a minimum amount of calories per day simply to survive Most people should not eat fewer than 1200 calories per day and in my opinion thats very low And thats without any exercise at all You can use to get a personalized calorie intake plan for weight loss In general to lose weight safely you should add the number of calories you burn from exercise to your minimum calorie intake to see the total number of calories you should consume Heres an example Burn 500 calories per day  1200 calories minimum intake  Consume 1700 calories total You can fudge that number a little to lose weight faster or slower By the way its very difficult to burn 1400 calories per day unless youre already an elite athlete You might need to revise your expectations in terms of exercise Best wishes to you Remember weight loss is a journey I suggest you get this checked out by a medical professional Many conditions can cause the symptoms you describe but one that comes to mind is a  Obviously if thats the case you want to get treatment as soon as possible Itching is not normally a sign of Staph infection but it still would be good to rule this out At any rate youre having abnormal symptoms that are worth getting checked Meanwhile be sure to wash your hands thoroughly and often In the event you have some sort of communicable infection you want to take every precaution not to transmit it to someone else I wish you all the best May be neuropathy or plantar fascitits You are brushing too far back stimulating your gag reflexOr you need to change tooth paste Xanax is part of a class of drugs known as Benzodiazepines and is prescribed for anxiety and panic disorders You may have heard the terms SSRI selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or GABA gamma amino butyric acid  Xanax changes brain function by altering GABA production in the brain at the receptor sites which alters the persons mood When used appropriately Xanax is very effective Studies have shown that longterm Xanax use can lead to dependence and addiction Quitting Xanax use cold turkey can be dangerous because the nature of the drugs slows GABA Gamma Amino Butyric Acid production and changes brain chemistry Suddenly stopping Xanax use can be too much for the brain to adjust to can result in serious side effects including

had temps of 966 taken in the hospital on a regular basis Consult a doctor If the skin has not been scraped or cut it could possibly be cellulitus caused by swelling of the legs or several other conditions all of which require a doctors care It could be a very serious condition so please make an appointment Extensive testing may not be needed in \t\t all people who have symptoms of \t\t gastroesophageal reflux disease GERD  A doctor may \t\t first ask you questions about your symptoms such as whether you have a \t\t frequent uncomfortable feeling of burning warmth heat or pain just behind \t\t the breastbone a feeling commonly referred to as heartburn  If you have \t\t frequent severe episodes of heartburn your doctor may prescribe medicines \t\t normally used to treat symptoms of GERD without performing any other tests If \t\t your symptoms get better with these medicines your doctor will usually \t\t diagnose you as having GERD  Depending on your symptoms your \t\t doctor may refer you to a specialist such as a \t\t gastroenterologist  for a test called an \t\t upper gastrointestinal endoscopy  This allows your \t\t doctor to look at the inner lining of your \t\t esophagus  stomach  and the first part of your small \t\t intestine  duodenum  through a thin flexible viewing instrument \t\t called an endoscope Endoscopy is \t\t used to Look for problems in people who have symptoms of GERD and also \t\t\t trouble swallowing dysphagia Look for other causes of your \t\t\t symptoms if medicines have not helped Sometimes endoscopy is normal but you \t\t\t still have symptoms that dont get better with medicine If so \t\t\t esophageal tests may be done This testing includes \t\t\t Manometry testing which determines how well \t\t\t\tmuscles in the esophagus move food into the stomach and how tightly the valve \t\t\t\tbetween the esophagus and stomach the lower esophageal sphincter closes \t\t\t\tManometry testing is also often required before doing surgery to treat \t\t\t\tGERD pH monitoring which tests how often acid from the stomach \t\t\t\tgets into the esophagus and how long it stays there Xray pictures of the esophagus and stomach are not used \t\t\t to diagnose GERD But they may be useful for detecting other problems that may \t\t\t be causing GERD symptoms such as a \t\t\t hiatal hernia or a narrowing in the esophagus \t\t\t stricture These Xrays may be done as part of a series of tests called an \t\t\t upper gastrointestinal series  The tests your doctor may recommend are based on your \t\t specific GERD symptoms Before you have more GERD testing  you may want to talk \t\t to your doctor He or she will be able to tell you what information the test is \t\t expected to provide and how the results will change your treatment I would not add any more medications on your regimen without consulting your healthcare professional and getting the condition looked at It is important to make sure we understand why you are experiencing the symptoms and treat it appropriately rather than just covering up with medication that isnt working If your primary care office cannot fix the issue consult a GI specialist This is a great question because there is currently much debate about this issue Recent studies have shown that longterm use of PPIs can lead to an increase in bone fracture risks in women I would encourage you to have a discussion with your health care provider about the risks and benefits Try Prilosec OTC I have experienced this as well however it happens to me only when I am sick especially if I have a fever I assume that is not the case with you because you say you are healthy but perhaps youre coming down with an illness such as a cold or flu Im not sure how long this has been affecting you so if it is not due to a regular illness such as a coldflufever here are a few ideas to google Tactile allodynia dysesthesia and fibromyalgia Tactile allodynia in particular sounds like exactly what you are describing I hope you find answers and get relief Good luck fevers are just a result of your immune system fighting off viruses and bacteria Mild fevers with no other symptoms are perfectly ok and are best untreated If your fever is accompanied by other symptoms or exceeds 101 then you should see a doctor Walmart in the OTC medications aisle Walgreens or any box store Would be stocked with other creams such as Neosporin etc Right upper abdomen could likely be your gall bladder An ultrasound may be able to tell your dr if there is any abnormality In any case minimizing fatty foods and alcohols will be essential It could be many other things though and a simple blood and stool test can tell your Dr a lot try not eating 34 hours before sleeping avoiding high acidic foods such as orange chocolate coffee alcohol avoid fatty foods Avoid smoking avoid mint it relaxes the sphincter that keeps acid in your stomach Sleep with your head elevated to prevent acid from coming up into the esophagus and laying on your left side can help Prilosec as directed may be better but it takes a few days to start working Relaxing and getting enough sleep are big Wear loose fitting clothing and lose weight if appropriate It could be a Brachial Cleft Cyst Might appear small on the outside of the neck but is actually growing on the inside Mine required surgery to remove still have the scar and grew to the size of a softball by the time it was surgically removed Only a doctor can say for sure but from what youve said it sounds like some form of dermatological irritation If that is the case try using a top notch penis health cream health professionals recommend Man1 Man Oil Look for one that includes a high end emollient like she abutter to soothe the irritated skin and help moisturize the skin Good luck Nexium is a medicine that is available over the counter and which can be used to treat heartburn symptoms but it should only be taken on a doctors advise Ask him to take

to diabetes People think that diabetes is not so serious and is just a little sugar and that is not true Diabetes is really when the body cant process sugar Diabetes can sometimes lead to obesity That is when the body builds up dangerous amounts of fat When you have diabetes you are going to have pain in your knee So you should check in with a doctor and tell him or her that you have diabetes Or you are prediabetic The reason that you are having skin burn when you sweat is because there are fats and toxins in your body that is not needed so when you workout you sweat and that is when your body gets rid of the fats that your body does not need which can cause obesity and death Your skin is burning so that it can get rid of the toxins in your body that can make you sick so be sure to take a good shower And also make sure that your hair is properly washed If it is not then the toxins in the sweat can damage your scalp and form hair dandruff Well there is an example of burning of the skin after you fall on a hard concrete surface scrapes and cuts are some of the causes of skin burn But there are some things that you can do to kill the bacteria that can make you sick You can use rubbing alcohol or peroxide liquid peroxide is better because the acid level that can fight off invading germs can actually heel the scrape or cut Something has changed Since you were both virgins

come into the relationship Maybe you should both see a doctor about this Yes it can but it is a fairly rare occurrence Not sure where the bursitis is but a car ride that long could cause anyone pain  especially someone with issues that can be aggravated like yours If you had to take less meds to do the drive that could cause a pain spike as well In 2008 researchers from Duke MD Anderson UNC U Michigan and NCI published their findings on the use of flaxseed supplementation as a nutritional preventive intervention for prostate cancer  According to this study ground flaxseed is safe and associated with biological alterations that may be protective for prostate cancer Well each person is very different which means that each human body has different levels of tolerance For example one persons body may be able to handle the 30 burns easier than others The body could go into shock from any traumatic experience such as a burn or being exposed to mercury The amount that the body can handle before going into shock is different for each person You also have to take into consideration the health of the person For example someone with healthy lungs usually has no complications recovering from bronchitis while someone with a condition such as asthma may have several complications because it is harder for the body to heal itself Even without the discharge you could have an yeast infection or a numerous of STD Not everyone is going to have discharge as a symptom On the other hand if the pain is only during intercourse it could be due to dryness but highly unlikely with an odor Most importantly seek medical attention This is a picture of it httpi1309photobucketcomalbumss621Kaylamartinez101Mobile20Uploadsimagezps856a0986jpg Any pharmacy should have this You could try an Apothecary also Believe it or not Aloe is a popular product thats available on all the shelves but there is no evidence that it actually works in helping sunburns So this is actually a good question Burows solution is usually used for poison ivy It helps relieve the itching not necessarily redness or inflammation So the rule of thumb is if you have sunburn what you want to do is definitely use cool compresses or sit in like a cool tub filled for about 1520 minutes You can take things like Tylenol or Advil to help alleviate any type of pain But if the sunburn is really bad and you start breaking out in blisters you need to see a medical professional for additional prescription products and also just to be evaluated to make sure you didnt do any additional damage to the skin Well the thing is you dont want to put ice on it If you put ice on it believe it or not the burn is kind of open skin in some cases so ice will actually adhere to the skin So when you try to take the ice off of it you will rip layers of skin with it and possibly cause an infection The recommendation is really to use tepid or cool water not super cold but right in the middle and submerse the area Butter and mayonnaise to me are like wives tales People believe that they should be putting some type of ointment on it to help replace the moisture in the skin That is not the case We found out in a lot of cases now that you need to let the air get to it and let it heal by itself because when they were putting things like ointments and creams on it it was trapping in bacteria leading to skin infections If you notice though its blistering and the area is extremely red You probably need to go and have it looked at by a healthcare provider because there are some prescription ointments and creams that are specifically used for burns This is a great question When patients come in or consumers and ask me about heartburn as a pharmacist I have to ask them a few questions to find out what kind of heartburn are they having For instance if they are having heartburn at night they really need to see a physician I need to find out how frequently they are having their heartburn If they are having it everyday or is it only one or two times a week Then I need to ask them some questions about their diet because what they may not understand is that diet caffeine acidic foods even smoking could lead to heartburn Then I will look at them and say okay are they taking any other medications My elderly patients hopefully they have their medication list with them I will be able to take a look and see whats appropriate for them There are a variety of different products that are available If its just something for quick relief then you could use like an antacid like a Maalox or a Tums something along those lines If its something that maybe needs a little bit more consistency then we can go more towards a Pepcid type of product which works a little differently by cutting down on the amount of acid in the stomach If they complain that they have had it more frequently during the day for a number of days then the choice might be something like Prilosec OTC which they are going to take for about 14 days If they come back to the pharmacy after that and the 14 days and it hasnt worked then I am going refer them back to their physician or their healthcare provider for further evaluation That is a possibility In some cases vitamins are recommended to be taken on an empty stomach but it does cause sometimes heartburn or people feel that their stomach has gotten a little sour So in that case as a pharmacist I recommend that they take their vitamins with food It actually helps cushion it help them dissolve a little bit better and therefore they wont have that If it gets really really bad the other recommendation I have is to take your vitamins at night They will dissolve as you sleep and therefore in the morning when you get up you wont notice the heartburn during the day as if you took it with your morning meal Just great advice from the pharmacist just come and ask us we are more than happy to help you This is a great question I do get asked about these common wives tales and unfortunately there is no data they have never been studied and therefore not recommended I mean the only real way to kind of decrease your factors of getting heartburn is to really change your diet Decrease your caffeine intake Dont eat spicy foods Stop smoking All these little things will probably end up doing better things for you and are very easy to incorporate in your everyday activities  It is not recommended that you apply ice to a burn because the ice can stick to the skin and do additional damage You do not want to puncture the blister because that could bring on an infection Continue to watch it and for the pain you can try taking an acetaminophen product like Tylenol If it continues to get worse you will need to see a health care provider If you have a red line running from the burn on your hand past your wrist it could already be infected and I would advise that you see a health care provider as soon as possible You should not use Epsom salts for a burn or ice You can submerge the area in cool water I would also not advise putting any antibiotic ointments or dressings until a health care provider has evaluated it This all depends on how much of your hand was burned  if it is a large area you will want to be seen by a health care provider as soon as possible Do not puncture the blisters and do not put anything on the burn like butter mayonnaise or ice Even if it is a small area you will want to watch it for signs of infection which includes redness swelling continued pain and possible oozing or a wet appearance I would have your mouth looked at as soon as possible by a dentist There is a possibility that you could also have an infection due to the burn I am a little concerned about the fact that this patient called it a bad burn Based on that description my fear is that there could be a skin infection possibility and it may not be healing properly If the skin has blistered or is broken it needs to be evaluated by a physician or health care provider as soon as possible I would not recommend putting antibiotic ointment on it due to the fact that there is limited data that it evens helps  you usually need oral antibiotics to help the skin layers underneath and leave uncovered I am concerned that you have serious heartburn as frequently as you described and would like to know if you have been evaluated by a health care provider I would also like to know if you have taken any overthecounter medications and what their effect was I dont think the baking soda in water is harmful but I dont see any benefit either I would highly recommend seeing a health care provider for further evaluation This is an interesting request I would need to ask you a few more questions because there really isnt any home remedy for heartburn I need to know how often you have been having heartburn and what your exact symptoms are I also recommend changing your diet There are many trigger foods that can cause heartburn For more information including a diary visit the National Heartburn Alliance at wwwheartburnallianceorg This is a good question because there are a few probiotics on the market that are helpful with the symptoms of IBS Some patients may be treating their heartburn gas diarrhea or constipation with over the counter medications not realizing that it may be IBS I would need to ask a few more questions in order to provide information I need to know exactly what probiotic you are taking and what acid reflux medication I also need to know what your symptoms are how long you have had them and what your diet looks like There are many factors that can contribute to heartburn and there are some simple lifestyle modifications we can try first to see if that helps Due to the fact that you have tried some overthecounter medications and it has been three days and you do not have any relief not able to drink or eat anything and still severe pain I would strongly recommend calling your doctor or health care provider as soon as possible or go to the ER to have it checked out This could be a sign of something serious This is a great question you can ask your pharmacist since we know about overthecounter products as well Pepcid AC is for the relief of heartburn associated with acid indigestion and sour stomach and for the prevention of heartburn associated with acid indigestion and sour stomach brought on by certain foods and beverages Can I ask why you are taking four ibuprofen a day and if you were advised to do so by a doctor or health care provider How long have you been taking them You will need to contact your doctor or health care provider for evaluation Ibuprofen can cause many gastrointestinal side effects and there is a possibility of a link between its use and ulcers Based on your doctors evaluation they may prescribe a prescription medication that does not have these types of side effects Actually both foods can contribute to heartburn and may actually make it worse When treating heartburn we always recommend nonpharmacological methods like avoiding spicy and fatty foods stop smoking and avoid eating at least three hours before bedtime This is actually not common I looked at the literature to see if there was any type of drug interaction and there is not I would advise calling your healthcare provider and letting them know that you are experiencing symptoms of GERD they may want to see you to reevaluate They may order a blood test to see what your level of Vitamin D is  Your symptoms of blurred vision burning eye redness and sensitivity to

possible that she is getting more than she thinks she is Seeing a registered dietitian can help her examine her food intake for hidden calories High levels of activity mixed with low calorie intake may increase cortisol levels stress hormone and cause weight to stay where it is This is a theory but I have seen it many times Your wife can experiment with cutting back the exercise or increasing her calorie intake Unless shes enjoying the exercise it likely isnt sustainable so I suggest she focused on doing something she enjoys If your wife did not exercise at all before it is possible she is gaining some muscle mass and losing fat even the scale isnt moving Other factors can cause weight to plateau such as stress and lack of sleep See this WebMD article for more ideas Weight loss  and especially weight loss maintenance  can be a challenging task I suggest your wife get help and support with the process The key is to address the reasons for the weight gain in addition to tackling food and exercise There is not a number of cups recommended for women or men to eat at a meal I suggest using feelings of hunger and fullness to help guide your eating This discusses the importance of mindful eating practices when eating out Paying attention and stopping eating when you start to feel full can be helpful liberating Its best for him to work with this with his doctor on potential causes and treatments Some people with high triglycerides may have a genetic tendency towards it or it could be caused by certain medications or a sign of uncontrolled diabetes Its best to make dietary changes which include low sugar intake no or little alcohol and overall healthy diet fruits vegetables lean proteins whole grains and healthy plant fats over animal fats He should talk to his doctor about high dose fish oils as it is sometimes used in conjunction with medications to help lower triglycerides with a doctors order For more on causes and treatment of high triglycerides see

burning option on the cardio machines and it really ought to be eliminated The idea behind the fatburning option is this Because fat is denser than carbohydrate it requires more oxygen to burn So to maximize the percentage of fat you burn compared to carbohydrate the fatburning mode would have you work out at a pace at which your body can deliver lots of oxygen to your muscles That generally means a slow pace to keep you from getting breathless The problem is that when you exercise at a slower speed you burn fewer total calories  from both carbohydrate and fat  because you simply dont do as much work Further the way to get aerobically fit is to get your heart rate into the training range usually 60 to 85 of your maximum heart rate which is hard to do at slower speeds And fitness is ultimately what youre after whether your goals are better health burning calories or improving heart and lung capacity The bottom line is that the fatburning mode probably wont be intense enough to maximize total calorie or fatburning or to help you increase or maintain optimum fitness levels Use the cardio mode to maximize your exercise benefits Running will burn more calories than the elliptical although its pretty close about 100 calories per hour difference Some of the difference is due to the pounding of running and the fact that you propel your body through the air so that both feet are off the ground simultaneously This kind of movement takes lots of energy Both the elliptical and running burn substantially more calories than the bike at the same level of perceived exertion about 200240 calories per hour more In a classic study comparing energy expenditure of exercise machines the order of calories burned from highest to lowest is posted below The elliptical was not studied in this research but it would fit between rowing and crosscountry skiing It should be noted that rowing the elliptical and crosscountry skiing are all very close in calorie expenditure with probably not more than 100125 calories per hour difference among them Treadmill walkingrunning Stair stepping Rowing Crosscountry skiing Biking stationary Now this is not to say that exercises that burn the fewest calories are all bad To the contrary you can get a great workout and burn lots of calories doing any of them Youd be hard pressed to say that Lance Armstrong isnt fit Hes one of the fittest human beings alive and he did it by biking The point is that if you work hard enough on any of the exercise machines and you work up a sweat and you get your heart rate into your training zone then your heart lungs and muscles arent going to know the difference Bottom line is that youll get fit and healthy using any of the machines if you use them consistently and with sufficient intensity One final note There is error in estimating energy expenditure on most if not all exercise machines In some cases it can be as high as 25 percent the machine overestimates how many calories you burn There are simply too many variables for the machine to give you an accurate number and so you need to keep that in mind during weightloss efforts if you are calculating how many calories to eat based on your energy expenditure Vaginal itching and burning can have several different causes Most common are yeast infections and bacterial infections Normal bacteria and yeast are both found in the vagina in a delicate balance Some things including antibiotics diabetes and pregnancy can upset the balance This allows the yeast cells to take over A yeast infection can result causing burning and

into the esophagus the tube that connects the mouth and the stomach The acid irritates the lining of the esophagus and can lead to heartburn Follow this link to a good series of slideshows that can

NHS Vaginitis means inflammation soreness and swelling of the vagina Many women with vaginitis also get abnormal vaginal discharge itching or burning in the vagina and discomfort during sex or when urinating A strong unpleasant smell particularly after sexual intercourse can also be sign Some women with vaginitis may experience few symptoms or none at all This page lists the possible causes of vaginitis with links to more detailed information about these conditions This guide should not be used to selfdiagnose your condition but should give you an idea of what is causing your vaginitis See your GP if you suspect the cause of your sore vagina is an infection You can read our information on abnormal vaginal discharge to find out if you have a vaginal infection and if so what this is likely to be Causes of vaginitis Vaginitis may be caused by any of the following infections or irritants thrush  a fungal infection that commonly affects the vagina bacterial vaginosis  a bacterial infection of the vagina trichomoniasis  a sexually transmitted infection STI caused by a tiny parasite chemical irritation  for example from perfumed bubble bath soap or fabric conditioner or from spermicide a chemical that kills sperm sometimes found on condoms washing inside your vagina chlamydia  an STI caused by bacteria genital herpes  an STI caused by the herpes simplex virus Do hope this helps you Good Luck Discharge could be a number of things Youll never know for sure until you get tested Id recommend you go see a doctor just to be on the safe side You should go see a doctor immediately I am glad that you went to the doctor for an exam and testing From what you have described it does not sound like Herpes A primary new infection typically takes 2 to 14 days to present itself A Herpes outbreak typically lasts 13 weeks and consists of blisters which cause pain itching and burning It is possible that the act of intercourse or the condom caused irritation of the labia minora I am not sure if you had just had intercourse the second time you had the burning sensation If you did then that may very well be the reason It is also possible that there is a sexually transmitted infection despite your negative testing It depends on what you were tested for and what you were not tested for There are so many STDs that is would be very difficult to test for everything The most common testing is for Gonorrhea and Chlamydia In addition I usually recommend testing for Herpes as well as HIV The burning sensation may also be from a nonsexually transmitted infection such as yeast or bacteria Regardless you should schedule an exam and discuss this with your doctor Burning as in redness and sensitive It could be that youre thighs are chaffing which is the act of skin rubbing together and creating an uncomfortable sensation change your diet start eating more fiber 24 grams per day sunflower seeds are great for fiber and you dont want to eat too much of one thing then you get an inconsistent stool that might also account for your nails the tooth decay is just you need to brush your teeth more often go see a dentist and get your teeth fixed and then start brushing them and keeping them clean the jaw popping could be related to the underbite youre gonna want to get braces maybe if youre losing your hair that may not be a big deal if it comes out in the brush thats normal if its like you go to wash your hair and it starts falling out like on the grudge you may wanna get checked out Generally burning is not normal However it could just be related to your period During a period it could be caused by several things Mainly external irritation caused by paper wiping and tampons causes the vulva to be more sensitive If you use a rigid abrasive or stiff tampon consider investing in a softer or more comfortable one Also it doesnt help that during menstruation hormonal changes often but not always affect the lining of your urethra When the urethra is irritated or thinner it is more likely to be agitated when something moves across it like pee Thus burning is common here Drinking more water will reduce the salinity of pee and should lessen the burn a bit Getting more sleep will improve tolerance to pain However long term burning could be the sign of an infection in your urinary tract It could also be a sign of blockage Thus I would get it checked out by a doctor if it persists for a long time I dont know how long is too long  I would definitely get it checked out if it persists after your period ends It could be the sign of a yeast infection here Further evidence of an infection would be red bumps that appear or vaginal discharge of a color other than that of blood ie grey discharge Most gym equipment overestimates the caloric burn by up to 15 Thats because treadmills stationary bikes and elliptical dont take into consideration a persons gender body composition muscle fat level of training age and whether or not someone is holding onto the handles of the machine which reduces the number of calories burned There are some forms of cardiac arrhythmia  including PAT paroxysmal atrial tachycardia and supraventricular tachycardia  that can cause those symptoms they can be diagnosed by a cardiologist using a Holter monitor test and there are other conditions including high blood pressure all of which might have been brought to light by hormonal changes following your recent pregnancy The best place to start is with your primary care provider It could be that you may need to take a mild dose of a Betablocker such as Metoprolol Tartrate which I take Once your doctors have ruled out anything more serious something along those lines could be of great help If there is an endocrine imbalance your doctor might decide to send you to an endocrine specialist but because of the recent pregnancy be sure to keep your OBGYN in the loop Good Luck In the meantime be sure to sleep with your head elevated slightly and it might help a little if you dont lie on your back it puts a little more stress on your mitral valves They usually prescribe compression stockings for such a condition Could be lymph nodes Get medical advice It is a gag reflex caused by brushing too far back in your mouth There are some normal changes that occur in pregnancy which may cause some pain  Progesterone a hormone that is high in pregnancy can cause the muscle that keeps the food in the stomach relax This can cause reflux and be very uncomfortable for patients Fortunately there is medication that can be used during pregnancy for women who have this problem Also patients can help themself out by watching what foods they eat These are just some of the methods that people are using for sunburns according to the Internet Obviously I cant endorse them Food products Mayonnaise yellow mustard tomato juice tomato slices fruit slices like peaches potato slices egg whites milk buttermilk yogurt raw honey Dr Pepper and vinegar Not only are these messy and weird it is really the temperature of the product  refrigerated or even room temperature  that is causing the effect not the product Sure cold mayonnaise would feel good but it is because it is cold not because it is mayonnaise Many have recommended tea poultices if you put it on cold it works almost as well as plain water Lubricants Butter olive oil shortening Dont use em Overthecounter drugssupplements Noxema hydrogen peroxide rubbing alcohol Benadryl vitamins applied to the skin shaving cream Vagisil Milk of Magnesia diaper rash creamsointments Preparation H Pepto Bismol and Colgate toothpaste These products have other uses but sunburn management isnt one of them Other treatments Vodka bleach Windex Tide laundry detergent and sandlewood paste You may have chronic balanitis perhaps due to yeast Make an appointment with a good urologist so you can get to the bottom of this six year old problem You cannot be blindly diagnosed over the Internet based solely on your brief postingyou need to be examined Let him do it Sometimes bad experiences help The answer is No If you try and burn a nerve there is a very good chance that the pain will be worse Lots of cold wateror cold compressesto limit the burn If the burn is extensive perhaps involving much of your hand and fingers you should see a medical provider Unfortunately I have no way of determining the extent of your burn over the Internet Dont rupture or pop any of those blisters and use an antibacterial burn ointment or cream How you would treat a heater burn would depend on MANY factors none of which you have shared in your question Here are some of them briefly The location of the burn  A burn on the palm of the hand genitals or face would be treated differently than on on the leg The extent of the burn  A burn that covers a large surface area would be more serious than one that involves a tiny area The depth of the burn  A first degree burn is like a sunburn A second degree burn has blisters A third degree burn is very deep and considered among the more serious First aid for most burns would be to cool down the skin rapidly with cold water ice etc to make sure the burning does not continue Minor burns tend to be selfhealing making sure they do not become infected Taking something for pain is often helpful Brief heater burns may fall into this category The more serious and deeper burns andor on those on sensitive areas should be seen by a medical provider as soon as possible The most serious of burns go to special burn units of hospitals See a urologist You are having symptoms suggestive of prostatitis an infection or inflammation in the prostate gland I am not sure if there is a relationship with your boweldiarrhea and fatigue issues so this could easily be an entirely separate medical problem If it is not onesided as you mentioned it is something else other than shingles but unfortunately without the ability to see it firsthand during an examination I would not be able to narrow down the many possibilities for you based solely on your description You would need to see a medical provider so you can have these skin lesions properly diagnosed The most likely cause would be an infectioneither a urinary tract infection or a vaginal infection In your case it could be both The urge to urinate is a primary symptom of a urinary infection but urethritis irritation of your urethra from vaginitis could also cause this annoying symptom You will need to see a medical provider so that you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated Many coughs can sound the same Now that you have more than just a cough it is important for you to see your medical provider again so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treatednot just for this lingering cough but for your new symptoms I cant see your rash but onesided blisters are more likely to be shingles Kidney stones do not cause rashes and the type of pain is extremely deep You body needs about 15 calories per pound of ideal body weight I do not know what you currently weigh If you eat less and burn more you will lose weight In a chronic situation where you are losing weight your body will attempt to lower your metabolic rate to compensate for this slowing down you weight loss In addition to calories you body needs a balance of protein more for men less for women fat and carbohydrates to achieve optimum health I dont know your sex or what your goals are but it may be best to seek the counseling of a good nutritionist The burn on or near a birthmark should be appropriately treated like any burn to avoid an infection and minimalize scarring Most first and superficial second degree burns will not scar but that depends on your own scarring potential varies from person to person and of course not all birthmarks are the same I dont have any idea what type of birthmark that you have When in doubt seeks hands on professional care A dermatologist would be your best consultant in this case When you are not sexually involvedeveryou do not have to worry about an occasion missed period It happens quite often to younger women I suspect that you will have a normal period next month Get your yeast infection properly treated since they can be miserable There are prescription pills that can be taken orally if prescribed by your doctor they will usually do this without seeing or examining you or you can get some Monistat over the counter I dont have any way of knowing if your vaginal discharge is an STD or not since I cant examine you look at the discharge under a microscope or test it in a lab nor do I know your sexual history or your boyfriends sexual history The only thing you can do if your doctors treatment is not working is to go backbe reexamined and be tested this time by a vaginal culture or smear A person can have a yeast infection AND something else so if you are worried about an STD that something else will need to be specifically tested Using milk may be as effective as plain water Milk really has no special healing powers for sunburnit is just the coolness of the liquid that helps releave some of the discomfort Without the ability to examine you I really have no way to know if you have balanitis or not Dont post a picture Uncircumcised men are more prone to balanitis caused by yeast which likes warm dark moist places but this tends to itch and become red If you are just noticing a white area just watch it for a while If it persists you would need to see your medical provider or a urologist but it sounds innocent Hopefully you are using a condom As much as I would like to help you it would not be possible for me or any medical professional to diagnose your boyfriends skin eruption based on your vague description I cant physically see your toe to provide you with a patientspecific answer but redness is a sign of infectioninflammation  common in this area called an oncyhia or paronechyia It would be wise for you to seek proper medical attention if this problem persists or worsens Anytime that you have unprotected sex you have the possibility of getting pregnant so DONT DO IT And make that guy use a condom no matter what fairy tale story he told you about the 3 chance of getting you pregnant That is baloney Dont you know that men lie Yesyou could be pregnant so you can really take a pregnancy test anytime now but you may need to repeat it again in another week or so if you do not have your period Your medical provider can also order a very sensitive blood pregnancy test if you want to increase your accuracy I dont know if you are a male or female but the urethra of both sexes is very sensitivity to irritation This irritation can come from soap residual or just minor trauma from toilet use It can be caused from a minor infection like yeast This is called urethritis and there can be many different causes That would depend on several other factors like the type of stroke For instance a butterfly would burn up more calories than freestyle Speed would be another factor  you burn off more if you are being chased by a shark than a leisurely swim The calorie expenditure also changes when you get in better shapea bad swimmer likely burns off more calories than someone who has a perfect stroke A round figure could be around 400 kcal but that is a very rough estimate Any skin lesion in or near the genital area should be evaluated A description alone does not rule out or accurately diagnose genital herpes but based on what you have posted it seems less likely It may be folliculitis  an infection of a hair follicle but without the ability to exam a patient this is only a guess If you are concerned it is going to take an examination and perhaps a diagnostic test like a culture to provide you with the assurance that you deserve It is possible but unfortunately I have no way of accurately diagnosing you based solely on the information you have provided It would not be inappropriate for you to try a vaginal yeast medication available overthecounter The pharmacist can help select one for you If you truly have a vaginal yeast infection Diflucan is an acceptable and effective treatment If this is the first time that you have had sex this bleeding can be from your hymen  a thin vascular tissue that surrounds the opening of the vagina This often will bleed from tearing Burning with urination can also be related to firsttime sexual experience often called honeymoon cystitis but it can be from a urinary tract infection Should this burning or bleeding persist you may need to see your medical provider for a proper examination and a urine test to see if you have an infection There are no oral medicines that are routinely used to treat common warts although some people have tried the cimetidine Tagomet but this is certainly an offlabel use with mixed results Personally I have never used it My suggestion would be for him to see a good dermatologistsomeone who can work with him closely trying different highend treatments until a cure is orchestrated He has definitely tried lots of things but I have never met a wart that I couldnt eventually kill with persistent treatments I use liquid nitrogen most of the time but there are more topical prescription treatments that can be used if the dermatologist feels it is appropriate I dont know if you are a male or female but chemical irritation soaps laundry detergent dryer softeners etc or irritation from sexual activity can certainly cause burning Children have very thin skin and are prone to scarring and infection if the burn is not properly assessed and treated It would be best since I have no ability to examine your son and determine the extent and seriousness of the burn blindly over the Internet to see a medical provider  either an urgent care facility or ER Yes or you can add some 1 OTC hydrocortisone cream to the miconazole to help with the itching Lay off for a few days and I am sure your volume will return Most ejaculate is semen not sperm created in the prostate gland Twice a day can be a bit much for this overworked gland to recover If you are still having burning you will need to see your medical provider but as a man it is not very likely that you have a UTIbut you could have prostatitis This is just a guess however since making that call requires an examination Your cold has nothing to do with this issue I cant see it as you know nor can I take a more detailed medical history or examine you to narrow down the possibilities This can be a bite spider or you may have secondary infectionjust a blind guess Without a handson examination you cannot be properly diagnosed or treated so I suggest that you seek a medical evaluation today I cant really answer that important questionnamely since I have no way of seeing this skin eruption first hand by examination One of many considerations should be shingles herpes zoster but this is just a blind guess based solely on your very vague description I would suggest that you see a medical professional so you can have this properly diagnosed and treated Not all UTIs are sensitive to amoxicillin This is way medical providers order a urine test to confirm the UTI and a culturesensitivity report to determine the BEST antibiotic to use for a particular infection All UTIs are different and 50 of women who have classic symptoms of a UTI end up not having one but other diagnosable causes like urethritis or even a vaginal infection Call your doctor and have the proper lab tests ordered for you You do realize that the experts on WebMD have no way of seeing your skin lesions nor examining youessential components for any medical professional in making an accurate diagnosis Because of the duration of your skin problem 45 years now it would be important for you to see a dermatologist  an expert and someone that can examine you firsthand You do not want to trust a blind guess See your medical provider right away Tachycardia rapid heart rate can be a sign of many different types of cardiac rhythm disorders so you may need to see a cardiologist for a full diagnostic workup See a dermatologist and have the wart assuming it is a wart professionally treated Yes the transmission of the herpes virus can be oralgenital There are many different causes of vaginal irritation so before getting to worried see your medical provider or womens health professional for a proper examination diagnosis and treatment Assuming that your sore throat is caused by acid reflux I would advise that you consult your medical provider now Not all cases of heartburn are due to reflux and not all reflux treatments are appropriate for everyone Your doctor may need to do run a few diagnostic tests before prescribing a patientspecific treatment regime Gastritis from his alcohol ingestion would be high on the list of possibilities Alcohol use can lead to gastric bleeding and ulcers as well There is no way to accurately diagnose your husbands stomach burning over the Internet so I would strongly suggest that he a stop drinking and b see a medical professional to start the diagnostic process When you burn sensitive skin it will turn red and may turn brown if it doesnt peel off Later in life it may turn into skin cancer Use sunscreen Seeking a tan is not good for your skin I would be wondering as well but you cannot make an important diagnostic call based solely on a brief description Any skin lesion that is painful or changing deserves to have a professional look at it firsthand If the dermatologist is not sure not all skin lesions can be identified by appearance alone then it may be recommended to have it surgically removed You would then have a cure since it would be gone and a pathological diagnosis  the most accurate Melanoma is not contagious but open skin lesions can become secondarily infected with bacteriaand this bacteria can be transfered to others The penis is covered by skin and skin can itch for hundreds of reasons A common cause would include yeast balanitis or simple dry skin like you described Contact dermatitis allergy to soaps or laundry detergent is another possibility A yeast infection would respond to an overthecounter antifungal cream dry skin or allergic rashes will respond favorably to hydrocortisone cream followed by a moisturizer Some people mix them together and use both so this may be something to try If it doesnt work see your medical provider or a dermatologist for a consultation and exam There are a few possibilities First there actually could be something caught in your throat but this would take a thorough examination by an ENT using a fiberoptic scope to make that call Second Inflammation from variety of events including reflux perhaps from a hiatal hernia as you mentioned something compressing your esophagus thyroid irritation from foodmedicinessmoking etc Third It could be psychological but before anyone tries to make this assumptiion ALL organic causes need to be ruled out You need to see a proctologist rectal specialist or gastroenterologist for a proper examination and treatment Anal HPV is not something you should ignore Untreated it can lead to cancer Orsomething very serious is happening When you have a bleeding area in the stomach the hydrochloric acid will turn it jet blackand this will cause tarry stools I have no idea if this is the underlying reason but it would be in your best interest to see a medical provider right away to determine if this black stool is blood or not Another possibility would be Pepto Bismolif you were taking it Noheartburn does not cause or increase uric acid See your medical provider Yes Xanax can help anxiety your reaction to stress assuming this is what is causing your symptoms but it will not help the underlying causes of stress Here is some basic information to start including some wonderful reference sites httpwwwwebmdcombrainpostpoliosyndrome Every person with PPS is different so there risks would also be unique to them You are having various connective tissue problems like a torn rotator cuff but as you know this can happen to people who do not have PPS myself included When having surgery it would be good for your doctor to be familiar with PPS or you may have to educate him I cant really answer this very patientspecific question since I do not know anything about you or your medical history nor do I have the ability to examine you It would not be prudent to blindly guess at a reason or reasons so my suggest would be for you to see a medical provider when this occurs You are selfdiagnosed and selftreated You have lost weight and are not improving so the answer is YES You need to see a medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated The calorie loss during the natural act of defecation would be close to zero unless of course you are having considerable constipation and straining Yes a yeast infection can do this Rather than assume they are both connected you would be wise to see your medical provider for an examination and prescription treatment Food is calories Food does not cause you to burn calories Exercise and other activities burn calories Restricting your caloric intake of food will help you lose weight but it needs to be done carefully Think about getting some medical or nutritional help with your weight reduction goals Will sunburned legs hurt the baby No What can you do How about using some sunscreen next time so you will not have to deal with unnecessary pain Right now you can just use coolcold compresses The temporary pain you are experiencing is to remind you not to let this happen ever again When you have your baby you will need to carefully protect him or her from the burning rays of the sun too This may be a sign of infection perhaps an STD I would suggest that you see a medical professional so that you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated You still could have an infection Prostatitis can cause a milky discharge but so can Chlamydia There are many causes that must be considered from a urinary tract infection rare in men to balanitis the red bloches See a medical provider so that you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated  things that cannot be accomplished over the Internet Before talking about a cure one must first have a diagnosis  a causereason for the eye redness and burning For instance allergies one of the causes would be treated differently than if the cause was a bacterial conjunctivitis pink eye No its only after sex It lasts for 3 hours or 4 It gets so red from the outside and my fianc told me that he has been realizing that im dryer than before Its lil but embarrassing Yeh ive been noticing it during foreplay but i kept going and didnt mention it to him Yeh ive been noticing im so dryer than before  I used to get wet straight when we kiss So should i start using lubricants or change the pill  And can the pill make you have pimples on ur face and body Definitely sounds like it could be an ulcer Id talk to your parents and get to the doctor WOW fell on your bum and wonder why it hurts The tailbone is a small little bone right above your butt and can be broken at anytime such as falling on it or giving birth

down for a while Take care of the baby bone holds the buns and we love them Please go to your doctor and have them also check for Gerd heartburn after ruling out any other heart issues I know this was

acid doesnt help remove your wart your doctor may recommend treatment with cantharidin a prescriptionstrength topical medication Cantharidin causes the wart to blister within three or so hours after application The blister lifts the wart off your skin allowing your doctor to remove the dead part of your wart  said it perfectly If you want to be 100 sure go to your physician and have him run the

lipoic acid doxycycline hcl doxepin sertraline protopic tacrilimus and amitriptyline hcl Steroids helped a lot Eletone kind of does for few minutes at a time Nothing else works Losing hope Please help Have you been tested for herpes simplex Sometimes if you dont specifically asked for certain test they wont perform them You also may be experiencing an allergic reaction to the soap you use or you may be allergic to cotton panties or the detergent you use to wash your clothes It may be something that you may have no idea how to find out if your allergic to in that case an allergy test is needed Talk to your OBGYN i have not experienced what you are going through but i did have anal fissures leading to bleeding also hard stools here is what worked for me i have boiled okra regularly for dinner as part of my diet spinach indian recipie for Plain palak 1 Apple a day Dried prunes in office for munching about 5 to 6 ATLEAST two Liters of water every day almond oil with warmor hot for me milk after dinner and important walking 30 mins a day if possible before the first visit to the toilet int he morning i never buy ebooks but i bought this one and some of them helped me httpwwwusfreeadscom2455300clshtml ebook pdf is called constipation help Im not saying this will cure your condition which looks a bit further away from where i was but these things in my diet helped me from what i experienced once you have this situation its better to see what foods you eat and make a regular schedule disclaimer i only told what i faced and how it helped me im not a docotr and have no medical knowledge i also cut out coffee entirely from my diet hotchoclate The only clear and prescise diagnosis that i am informed of is called an Upper GI test where the specialists have you ingest a barium containing drink that emmits some kind of glow inside your body that can be seen through a type of xray that they view as the barium travels down your gastrointestinal tract Actually very interesting to watch Try some allergy eye drops you can get them at wal mart If its not better by the next morning he does need to go to the doctor This might sound silly to you but this happens to my belly button pretty frequently and the best thing Ive found for it is called Boudreauxs Butt Paste its a diaper rash cream that can be found in most grocery stores or walmarts You just spread it on pretty thickly and wait over night and the pain and redness will have decreased and itll be on its way to healing I repeat usage as needed Boudreauxs Butt Paste is completely harmless so it can be used frequently It has a pretty sweet scent but its not unbearable and it certainly beats vinegar Thank you for the response I dont know if that will work though I mean its been happening since last monday  While Prilosec or Gavisconor even PeptoBismolmight help the reflux as well as the stomach pain if you have chronic pain when eating there is a possibility that you might have a peptic ulcer Generally pain increases whenever food is consumed ie when your body initially begins production of gastric acids in order to start digesting your food and can be excruciating If you are on any medications you should talk to your doctor immediately You may be having an allergic reaction I would buy a real aloe vera plant Cut off a leaf slicing open one side and pealing it open to expose the center scrape the jelly off apply to wound and only if you have to cover it like you would any other wound  Since the aloe dries and is absorbed quickly you should apply frequently using as much of one leaf as possible before using another leaf It helps with the stingingburning sensation and helps the wound heal quickly Your treatment depends on the cause of orchitis In most cases where orchitis is caused by epididymitis treatment is an oral antibiotic such as cefalexin or ciprofloxacin until infection clears up For viral infections antibiotics are not recommended In both causes nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs such as naproxen or ibuprofen are recommended to relieve pain Sometimes stronger pain medications in the opiate category are called for and are frequently prescribed by experienced emergency room physicians You may be better of keeping in touch with your physician For more information you can check out these sites httpenwikipediaorgwikiOrchitis

continue and try not to take any other medications But if still not controlled you can take Ondensteron tablet 10mg before taking alpha lipoic acid I found this information in an article  on the symptoms of heart burn Many people have different acid refluxrelated heartburn triggers but most people have similar heartburn symptoms A burning feeling in the chest just behind the breastbone that occurs after eating and lasts a few minutes to several hours Chest pain especially after bending over lying down or eating Burning in the throat  or hot sour acidic or saltytasting fluid at the back of the throat Difficulty swallowing Feeling of food sticking in the middle of the chest or throat Heartburn may cause chronic cough sore throat or chronic hoarseness Reporting these symptoms is usually all that is needed for your doctor to make the diagnosis of heartburn However your doctor may perform special tests to determine the severity of your problem or to monitor your treatment

bleach being put in them about a year and a half ago could be sinuses Have them test you for cdiff clostridium difficile colitis I contracted this after surgery symptoms sound very similar Not normal sounds like an allergy Id take some benadryl and get to a doctor ASAP Could Acid Reflux also cause upper back pain I had this same burning sensation for years I was later diagnosed with DCIS Ductal carcinoma in situ Make sure you are getting regular mammograms to be safeWhen caught early I was able to have a lumpectomy and radiation onlyThe cancer is in the milk ducts only with this diagnosis I am surprised at the fact that you have all these diagnosis And test results But have not been treated for the symptoms It may just be a urinary tract infection I would revisit the Dr who gave you this imformation and results from your test And tell him or her that the problem still persist You didnt mention if his foot was swollen And or has any red lines in the area It could be as simple thing as gout Which is very painful And common for his age He would need further test to find the root of the problem An allergic reaction to what  Sounds more like some type of infection The sores need to be looked at by a Dr An a urine lab test done There are a lot of over the counter medications for your condition And they do help I would suggest you ask your Pharmacist for the best one to fit your problem I would get my gallbladder checked nerve damage to your hand I had a small breakout on the end of my nose but the shingles were actually internalup my nose and in my ears and throat I had this prob in the past and it was a stye i alternated hot and cold and it brought the head out then it drained and went away after a couple of days It might be a menicus tear I have one go to an orthopedic surgeon get an MRI It should confirm a tear in the menicus Pictures here I say call your doctor to get checked for a UTI Some UTIs just dont follow the rules no pain no fever and you think no way

FibromylagiaIf the sensation is like a burn and it makes it hard to move your muscles sometimes I would do some research on other fibromylagia symptoms and see if it matches up Good luck Cialis can cause decreased tone of the LES in the distal esophagus predisposing to active GERD symptoms particularly in patients whose systolic BP decreases for the initial 23 hours following ingestion While not considered to be an absolute contraindication except in those with known IHD the patient should discuss this tendency with his PCP before continuing to take Cialis at any dose I dont know why but over the 20 years Ive had it  Ive noticed as soon as I change out of my clothing from the day I have this problem I just figured it must have something to do with the area suddenly being exposed to oxygen Ive learned to not wear tight jeans during a breakout to avoid agitation This sounds like either pinched nerve in your neck or maybe even fibromyalgia You need to get this checked out You should really see your family physician 10 When Should I Call the Doctor About Digestive Problems You should call your health care provider if you have any of the following digestive symptoms Heartburn that persists andor becomes more severe or is not relieved by medication A sensation of food caught in the chest or throat Unusual or persistent abdominal pain Discomfort that interferes with daily activities Difficult or painful swallowing Heartburn that causes vomiting Vomiting of blood Bloody or black stools Dramatic weight loss Persistent hoarseness andor a sore throat Episodes of choking Persistent diarrhea New or persistent constipation Apple cider vinegar would be the best out of all vinegars due to the acidic levels which will kill off dead cells causing the skin to make new healthy cells by applying to sunburn for one minute via cotton ball With this being said it will significantly dry out your childs skin and would absolutely need aloe vera as a follow up If you can find a brand that contains vitamin e or c together that is a bonus otherwise get vitamin e lotion as well for a healthy moisturizer Hope this helps could be a heart attack it probably best to see a doctor about it Something I couldnt put I was sleeping a normal 7 hours and that was making me depressed during the day which is probably the BPD But I practically HAVE to sleep 12 hours to be able to

and Toast dry DO NOT CHEAT while on the BRAT diet Not even a bite And only drink water Eat this way until you have solid bowel movements for a day Then reintroduce bland foods The bland meal I always have to follow up is plain chicken breast yam and rice If the stool gets loose again go back to the BRAT for another day or two I used this remedy with my children whenever they had diarrhea and it

action was taken the worse the condition got My reconmendation is to persue this untill you have a finite action plan My diagnosis came from a dermotologist that was recomended and arranged by my allergy and asthma doctor Treatment was long over a year and I experienced many complications no stress Can be caused by alcohol abuse or eating too much animal proteins in the evening meals this

she has had bacteria coming out of her skinsounds like this is on the same line of what she hasmaybeyou should do a lyme decease western blot test and see if you have any bandsif you have any bands then do study on those bacteria bands and see if this is curableif it is stage 1 it can probarbly be cured if it has been going on for at least 2 yrsthen it will be alonger treatment and might not be curableI am not a doctor and I could be wrongjust saying if you didnt drink alot in the first place it could be your body flushing its self if you dont drink alot of water and then you start all at onec only drinking water you will have a clencing cycle if i my Id advice to repeatedly wash off your eyes with cold tap water Then switch off lights and be in dark for a minute Then turn on light to see if you have sensitivity to light If you experience sensitivity to light then it is advisable to visit a doctor Hope it helps Not sure about GERD but they suggest not drinking really cold drinks

thinking my water broke  no I just peed a little I was humiliated guess what the hospital was not they would rather me and my child were better off safe than sorry Please go in and good luck to you Shingles according to my mom are very painful Also hers were on her back  i saw it had no idea first and felt it it was warm thankfully i didnt get it but I went to the doctor as I was very early pregnant Nothing is ever really 100 effective I heard that you can get pregnant after 10 years of having something like that done yes but its unlikely to give to to him cause unlike women males have a very long track and its much harder for a man to get a uit i would say it safe to have sex  to be sure he doesnt get one since there is always a chance tell him to pee after and he shouldnt have any problem you also try to pee after sex if you have a uti and based on what you said you do try to drink as much water as you can cranberry juice is also known to help and try not to pee everytime you get the urge to cause this can make it worse and cause bleeding  you have very small viens in the walls of your track which can break when you strain like you do when you have a uit  also if you just got one try the water diet for a day or so if it doesnt get better go to the doctor and get meds be sure to take them all even if you done have the discomfort anymore  i myself have been able to stop a uti with alot of water and trying not to always pee giving my blatter a chance to bluid up pee before going  but this doesnt always work okay  hope this helps well only thing i can think of other than things like anti acids is milk drinking milk can really help  due to the fact its a natural anti acid also he could ahve acid reflucks  typo sry lol  for now tell him to drink the milk water even though it may seem like it would help wont and eatting to much at one time will also make it worse i would get him to start eatting little means and drinking more milk  and if that doesnt help him  knock him out n take to the doctor   with men thats the only way to get them to do what we want  lol also tell him that if left untreated it can burn through the lineing of your stomach and believe me cause i have acid refluks its more painful than he would think  i hope this helped and i hope ur husband feels better  It could be your gallbladder If you still have your gallbladder speak to your physician about your symptoms He should be able set you up with a HIDA scan to see if that is what is causing your discomfort I get the exact same thing when my neck is out of whack I have always been under chiropractic care but none really helped until I found an upper cervical specialist The abbreviation for their special training is NUCCA you can look them up that way It really changed my life I went from a reverse curve in my neck to almost normal Hope that helps I have Neuropathy and my doctor wanted to do this but stated that it is a 5050 chance that it would work My wife is a nurse and she asked about this with doctors she assists at the hospital and they stated the same and also the pain usually returns Please see a gynecologist ASAP I had Endometriosis before a radical

few calories that their body is activating its starvation mechanism cauing muscles to be catabolized as well as drastic decreases in overall metabolic rate If heshe wants to loose weight they should eat on average 5001000 calories a day less than their adjusted basal metabolic rate depending on how much weight loss is required you can calculate this number here httpwwwcaloriescalculatornetDailyCalorieCalculatorhtml That is to say the less weight you have to loose the less of a deficit is required This deficit causes your body to pull from its fat reserves without unreasonably increasing the rate of muscle atrophy Having said the American College of Sports Medicine recommends that calorie intake never fall below 1200 calories a day for women or 1800 calories a day for men "}
