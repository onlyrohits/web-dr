{"text": "Im not sure exactly what you mean by  why has it not shown up for me during both my pregnancies I assume you mean that it is not showing up in the blood work that you physician iis ordering during your pregnancies Since you are aware that your husband has the virus I am sure you and your husband are abstaining from sex during his outbreaks By abstaining during his outbreaks your chances of the virus being transmitted to you is only 5 to 10 percent I can only GUESS that so far you have not be infected yes most definately Dont even play aroundI was unfortunate enough to retrieve both from my first love Cannot see the question due to your 3 articles  1 video in a box directly on top of the questions It is surprising that your doctor is unfamiliar with HSV2 because genital herpes is very common One out of five woman between the ages of 14 and 49 has genital herpes Men are less likely to be affected 1 out of 9 because the virus is more easily transmitted to a female during sex with an infected male Gynecologists are the appropriate doctors to treat genital herpes for a woman For both sexes STD sexually transmitted disease clinics are appropriate For a man a urologist a dermatologist or an infectious disease doctor would be the appropriate choice to help you with your treatment plan Although there is no cure for herpes treatments can relieve the symptoms Medication can decrease the pain related to an outbreak and can shorten healing time They can also decrease the total number of outbreaks Drugs including Famvir Zovirax and Valtrex are among the drugs used to treat the symptoms of herpes Warm baths may relieve the pain associated with genital sores Preventing the spread of genital herpes is extremely important If you have genital herpes you can still spread the disease if you have no symptoms Although daily antiviral medication reduces the risk of spreading genital herpes it doesnt totally eliminate the risk A herpes vaccine is in the works but unfortunately has not been perfected at this time That is why practicing safe sex and using a condom are the keys to preventing the spread of genital herpes If you truly feel suicidal please report to a hospital emergency room to be evaluated Lets deal first with the depressed feelings Depression is really anger turned inward Somehow you feel ashamed and that life is over because you have contracted the Herpes Simplex 1 Virus ORAL HERPES You must move forward and accept the fact that sometimes bad things happen to good people Talk with a friend your doctor clergyperson or a mental health counselor about your feelings and develop a plan to share the medical condition with your parents You can then hold your head up high and will probably find that your parents will be supportive Please do not blame yourself or the two girls that you kissedYes kissing is one way of contracting the Herpes Simplex 1 virus Oral Herpes but it may also be contracted through the sharing of personal items such as eating utensils razors toothbrushes I bet that you did not know by the time of adolescence that 62 of Americans have been infected with the Herpes Simplex 1 Virus As you indicated there is no cure for the virus but is also not a death sentence Some people actually have one outbreak of the virus and never again are symptomatic During outbreaks cold sores may be treated with antiviral medications and by applying heat or ice to the painful area typically id say so only because ive never heard of herpes including pussfilled sores but to be on the safe side  always get checked by a professional herpes will bleed after clear fluid is popped from the blister what are herpes sores No not a good idea THIS IS MY  IN ANSWER TO THE MD I GOT THE HERPES VIRUS WAY BEFORE I MET HIM RECENTLY WE BOTH BEEN TESTED NEG AND NO OTHER DISEASES HAS REARED ITS UGLY HEAD WE MAY NOT ALSO AGREE BUT RUNNING TO SOMEONE IS NOT SOMETHING TO DO STAY COMMITED IS WHAT IT ALL ABOUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTEMPT  ANSWERING MY  TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE AND TO PUT YOUR MIND  EASE GET YOURSELF TESTED WHEN MY EX WAS HAVING PROBLEMS WITH HIS MANHOOD HE GOT TESTED AND UNFORTUNATELY HE HAD IT ALTHOUGH THERES NO CURE DOCTORS CAN PRESCRIPE MEDICINE TO EASE UP ON SOME OF THE SYMPTOMS FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCETHERE ARE A FEW FACTORS THAT BRING ON OUTBREAKS MORE FREQUENTLY IF YOU DIDNT ALREADY KNOWEXCESSIVE STRESS AND EXCESSIVE CAFFIENEAS WELL AS BEING RUN DOWN AND NOT EATING HEALTHYI TAKE ACYCLOVIR ON A REGULAR BASIS FOR MAINTENANCE UNTIL I CAN MAKE MY LIFE CALMER1 MORE PERSONAL NOTEKEEPING THE AFFECTED AREA COOL AND DRYCORNSTARCH HELPS WITH THAT ALSO WEARING COTTON UNDERWEAR FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCEAT FIRST THE OUTBREAKS CAME OFTEN UNTIL I LEARNED HOW TO CONTROL THEM MIND YOU EVERYONES BODY IS DIFFERENT FOR ME IM VERY SENSITIVE TO ALL MEDICATION AND REMEDIES I HAVE HAD GENITAL HERPES FOR OVER 25 YEARS AND THESE DAYS I GET AN OUTBREAK MOSTLY WHEN I AM WAY OVER STRESSED AND TIRED AND CONSUMING TO MUCH CAFFIENETHE BEST MEDICATION AND THE ONLY ONE FOR PREVENTIVE AND HEALING IS ACYCLOVIR As for the valtrex Im not an expert or anything it is important that you definitely need to check with the doc and make sure that there is no danger in you NOT taking the meds They may still require you to take them Obviously none of us are medical experts so all I can tell you is my opinion on what I would dothink if I were in your situation Im no expert but yes it is possible even when breakouts are not apparent because there are body fluids from the genital area coming in contact with the mouth it is possible Even more so when there is an outbreak even if its not full blown yet you may just be itching Male  I have a brief pain in my groin area before the outbreak However over the years I have learned to take 2 of my natural herb capsules twice a day and the outbreak does not occur I have an outbreak approx every 7 months Hope this helps Male  I use a natural herb for my outbreaks and have for 17 years with no apparent side effect I have an outbreak approx every 7 months On a long week end trip to Tennessee by chanceluck I realized that this natural herb relaxer worked great How long before you know if youve been infected with  Possibly never Many people like your fiancee have no idea theyre infected with genital herpes Thats how it gets spread And men like yourself often have few symptoms If you do get symptoms youll likely notice small blisters on your penis or scrotum These eventually will burst and crust over before disappearing However its possibly youll never notice them Because you know your fiancee positively has herpes you should see your doctor for a to determine whether or not you also have the virus If you dont have the virus and dont want to contract it then you should use a condom It does not provide 100 protection against getting herpes but its a good start To increase your chances of avoiding the virus dont have sex when your fiancee is having an active outbreak of sores Im sorry to hear your fiancee just learned she has herpes Just FYI there is no cure for this yet I wish you both the best I would suggest you get this looked at by a health care provider Id recommend starting with your primary health care provider as opposed to a dermatologist The symptoms you describe could be caused by an allergic reaction as you suspected but they could also signal something else such as infected hair follicles cysts or other disorders If theres an infection involved youll need to get it treated or it wont clear up Thats why I suggest you consult your primary health care provider first Youre right to be concerned about this though I wouldnt panic by any means If possible take some photos of the rash or outbreak in case you cant get an appointment while youre experiencing the problem Take care The short answers are Yes and yes If a person with an active cold sore performs oral sex on his or her partner the partner can develop  A cold sore is caused by the herpes simplex HSV1 virus and genital herpes are caused by a related virus herpes simplex HSV2 If youre concerned about whether or not you have contracted HSV2 from sexual contact with your partner your health care provider can have you take a blood test to determine if you have either HSV1 or HSV2 Always remember to practice safe sex A condom may not offer complete protection against genital herpes because the lesions associated with this condition may occur on skin outside the area covered by the condom For this reason you shouldnt have sex with anyone who is having an active outbreak of either genital or oral herpes I wish you all the best The short answer is Yes Unfortunately you have exposed yourself to  It doesnt matter that the cold sore was scabbed over or that the lip lesion barely touched your penis A person with herpes can spread the virus even when its not active Your girlfriends herpes most definitely was active since she had a lesion This does not mean you positively will develop genital herpes but youre flirting with disaster You need to take better precautions in the future There is no cure for genital herpes If you do develop genital herpes you absolutely must disclose the fact to your partners before you have sex with them They have a right to decide whether or not to risk getting the virus from you And while condom use is good be aware a condom wont necessarily protect you from herpes because the virus can reside in groin areas that arent covered by the sheath Im not sure how old you are but you may want to read about the rise in genital herpes transmission among US teens due to having oral sex with an infected partner Even if youre not a teenager the same scenario applies to your story Please stop engaging in unsafe sex Always use a condom Dont have any type of sexual relations with a person who obviously has a virus that can become a sexually transmitted disease You owe it to yourself and your sexual partners to be responsible about your sexual practices Wishing you well Unfortunately yes the risk really is that big Even if youre not having an active outbreak of cold sores youre still infected with the  which causes the cold sores This virus can be transmitted through any physical contact including kissing The problem with HSV I and genitalia is that increasing evidence shows HSV I can cause genital herpes Both of these viruses are incurable and your girlfriend is rightfully concerned about being infected with a lifelong case of genital herpes by your performing oral sex on her I wish I could offer a good solution to your problem The only safe way for you to perform oral sex on your girlfriend is with a barrier in place You could look into the to see if it provides enough coverage for you to avoid skintoskin contact between your mouth and her genitalia including the clitoris Otherwise your best bet is to avoid oral sex altogether Remember however that oral sex is just one way to pleasure your partner If the lack of oral sex is a dealbreaker for your girlfriend then shes not the girl for you Take care I think what youre asking is Can you transmit genital to your partner if you have oral herpes but you do not perform oral sex on her And the answer to that is no You also cant give her oral herpes if you dont kiss her Herpes is transmitted by direct contact I applaud your concern about not transmitting herpes to your partner However what concerns me more here is the issue of safe sex in general How do you know SHE doesnt have genital herpes that may be transmitted to YOU She could have genital herpes and not even know it Or she could be infected with HPV and not know it In fact she could have several sexually transmitted diseases and be unaware of it Why would take chances with reproductive health by not practicing safe sex at all times Plus of course theres the issue of pregnancy Do you want to become a father Are you ready to become a dad Because its possible if youre having unprotected sex No method of birth control is 100 effective but you can increase the effectiveness of any birth control by using redundant systems to borrow a term from computer science In other words even if your partner is using some form of birth control you can also use a form of birth control in this case a  to make sex even safer in terms of pregnancy prevention Again I think youre very wise to be aware that you have oral herpes and to be concerned about not transmitting this virus I hope you think about the other issues I brought up too Great question The US National Institutes of Health supports various types of research clinical trials studies of the biology of herpes simplex virus The ClinicalTrialsgov website currently shows 93 open studies related to various aspects of herpes The site also shows a total of 399 open or completed studies over the past several years In terms of progress the answer is slow Why Because viruses are notoriously hard to crack Were still trying to decode them if you will Eventually I think well win the battle against viruses In terms of your girlfriend transmitting the herpes simplex virus HSV which causes cold sores   and  the key is not to have any physical contact with the active lesion In other words dont kiss her when she has an active cold sore and dont allow her to kiss your genitals when she has a cold sore As long as you do that you should be OK Hope this helps Yes there are Many communities offer support groups for people with STDs and you certainly can obtain individual counseling for help dealing with the emotional issues associated with having an STD like herpes Right here at WebMD we offer an online where youll find support and resources to help you cope with your condition If youre feeling depressed about your STD situation please know youre not alone Do seek out therapy or talk with others who share the same feelings so you can feel better emotionally Wishing you well Well if by automatically you mean the virus jumps across space and into your system then no Transmitting herpes requires skintoskin contact Its generally advisable to avoid having sex with your partner when he or she is having an active outbreak of  The problem is that a condom may not cover all of the skin areas that could come into contact with the lesions If you have unprotected sex with a partner who is having an active herpes outbreak the chances are very high you will also get the disease Genital herpes is incurable so once you have it you have it for life If you have had protected or unprotected sex with someone who is having an active outbreak of genital herpes and you want to know if you contracted the virus you can consult a medical professional for blood testing to find out You also should avoid sleeping nude with someone whos having an outbreak of genital herpes Any skintoskin contact in the genital region can transmit the virus I hope this helps Bumps in the genital area can be caused by many sources including as you already know the herpes virus Another potential cause is human papilloma virus HPV which often looks like warts Skin tags and small fatty tumors also can cause bumps in the genital area However none of these types of bumps will wash away with soap and water Youd be welladvised to see a physician about this as soon as possible If for instance the bumps you saw are caused by HPV it means you can transmit the virus to your sexual partners In any case youll sleep better at night finding out exactly what is causing these bumps Dont be embarrassed to discuss this issue with your health care provider You can start with your primary care provider He or she will be able to direct you to a specialist if needed I was just diagnosed after being faithfully married for 10 yrs and only 1 other partner before him so I would like to know the answer to your question as well I am sure you feel just as hopeless as I do and I still have so many unanswered questions it seems  Life is so unfair yes All herpes viruses can lay dormant in your body your whole life It is possible to never have outbreaks if you are infected with the virus If you want to know your status get an STD panel done and specifically ask them to test for HSV1 if that is what you are worried about no There is nothing over the counter however the manufacturer of the drug used to prevent outbreaks Valtrex does have a patient assistance program which once you sign up will mail you a 3 month supply of the drug at one time When that three months is almost over you will receive the next package At the end of a year youll have to be reassessed but if you still dont have insurance you will still qualify The manufacturer is GlaxoSmith Kline the

long away from the body That is to say that technically the surface of your skin isoutside of your body but contact with the infected area of your skin can spread it Always wash your hands and try not to let anyone come into contact with the area of infection if at all avoidable The germ killing properties inherent in soap will stop the virus then and there I definitely wouldnt share the same wash cloth but thats more of a general hygiene rule anyway Speaking as someone who has this virus it would be best if you search your heart for the answer rather than leave it to public opinion That is a major disrespect of your relationship with her The virus is common and most people dont even know they have it If you are careful with each other and lead clean healthful lives the risks to you are greatly minimized As for the comments about waking up with a deformed penis pay them no heed The virus doesnt operate that way What is the name of the Natural Herb you used if you dont mind me asking This sounds like exactly what happened to me I was in the most excoriating pain I ever felt and it was blisters and small bumps not puss filled bumps I went to the doctor they said they never seen anything like it and swabbed me for herpes but prescribed me the same medicine that you take for BV The next day after taking the medicine everything went away but I was left not knowing what it really was This has always bothered me because I felt it must have been a herpes outbreak but I tested negative for herpes Please let me know if you found out what this could have been Herpes simplex type 1 which is transmitted through oral secretions or sores on the skin can be spread through kissing or sharing objects such as toothbrushes or eating utensils In general a person can only get herpes type 2 infection during sexual contact with someone who has a genital HSV2 infection It is important to know that both HSV1 and HSV2 can be spread even if sores are not present Pregnant women with genital herpes should talk to their doctor as genital herpes can be passed on to the baby during childbirth via WebMD  Yes herpes can be transfer without a outbreak It is not definite that a person will become infected with it though if no outbreak is present It is also more likely to pass on the virus during the first year with or without a breakout Herpes is not a blood borne pathogens it is passed through fluids Nonot at all Herpes is spread through contact of any kind to the affected area If a blister ruptures and it touches not only another person but other part of your body you will spread it It needs to be added to the doctors answer that if you have blisters anywhere on your private area that is not used for sex a condom will not help Example if you have blisters on the bend of your leg or tip of your butt cheek a condom isnt going to help WHATEVER you dono matter whatdo not EVER have sex with someone if you know you have herpes without telling your partner You might think you are safe but in fact you could spread it You will be shocked how many people have herpes You will be shocked how your partner reacts if they care about you Heck you might be shocked on what they confess to you I would most definatley get back to the doctorwhat he has is SHINGLES not Herpes and it is VERY painful He needs meds to help speed up the healing process and take a daily does to help prevent future outbreaks Is the herpes virus in drinking water Can water it be boiled safe yes i have same problem except i use to get wet before i had a hysterectomy but i have never had an orgasm either and if i did i did not reconize it Symptoms of genital herpes are similar in men and women Once exposed to the virus there is an incubation period that generally lasts three to seven days before a lesion develops During this time there are no symptoms and the virus cannot be transmitted to others An outbreak usually begins within two weeks of initial infection and manifests as an itching or tingling sensation followed by redness of the skin Finally a blister forms The blisters and subsequent ulcers that form when the blisters break are usually very painful to touch and may last from seven days to two weeks The infection is definitely contagious from the time of itching to the time of complete healing of the ulcer usually within two to four weeks However as noted above infected individuals can also transmit the virus to their sex partners in the absence of a recognized outbreak Specific signs and symptoms of herpes in women include tiny fluidfilled blisters vesicles on the vulva and vaginal opening When the vesicles rupture painful ulcers are the result In a majority of patients inflammation of the cervix is involved cervicitis Cervicitis may be the only sign of genital herpes in some women Women with genital herpes may have pain on urination along with infection and inflammation of the urethra urethritis Although there is no known cure for herpes there are treatments for the outbreaks There are oral medications such as acyclovir Zovirax famciclovir Famvir or valacyclovir Valtrex that prevent the virus from multiplying and even shorten the length of the eruption Although topical applied directly on the lesions agents exist they are generally less effective than other medications and are not routinely used Medication that is taken by mouth or in severe cases intravenously is more effective It is important to remember that there is still no cure for genital herpes and that these treatments only reduce the severity and duration of outbreaks Since the initial infection with HSV tends to be the most severe episode an antiviral medication usually is warranted These medications can significantly reduce pain and decrease the length of time until the sores heal but treatment of the first infection does not appear to reduce the frequency of recurrent episodes In contrast to a new outbreak of genital herpes recurrent herpes episodes tend to be mild and the benefit of antiviral medications is only derived if therapy is started immediately prior to the outbreak or within the first 24 hours of the outbreak Thus the antiviral drug must be provided for the patient in advance The patient is instructed to begin treatment as soon as the familiar preoutbreak tingling sensation occurs or at the very onset of blister formation Finally suppressive therapy to prevent frequent recurrences may be indicated for those with more than six outbreaks in a given year Acyclovir Zovirax famciclovir Famvir and valacyclovir Valtrex may all be given as suppressive therapies HSV2 or herpes simplex virus2 is the most common cause of genital herpes Genital herpes is a very common sexually transmitted disease According to the CDC it affects about one in every 6 people in the United States between the ages of 14 and 49 Many family doctors are comfortable treating HSV2 Women may also seek help from their gynecologist or a dermatologist Men may want to consult a urologist or a dermatologist for help in managing this condition You can get a lot more information from the WebMD Genital Herpes Heath Center httpwwwwebmdcomgenitalherpesdefaulthtm If you have symptoms of a herpes outbreak even if mild there is a risk of transmitting the infection to your partner In fact even if you dont have a herpes outbreak you could transmit the infection to your partner Whether you have an outbreak is not a reliable way to prevent transmitting infection Even people on medication can transmit infection  even with no outbreak The best way to help prevent infection is to always use a condom Heres a that further explains Hope that helps I have a secondary question that goes along with yours hope you dont mind me piggy backing on your question If someone has unprotected sex with someone that has herpes and that person breaks out during the unprotected sex and then that person who Didnt have it gets a blood test for herpes just 7 days later and that comes back Negative for that person Is that Conclusive or Does it take Longer to show up in the Blood Test How long after being Exposed to Genital Herpes before a Blood test would be Conclusive that a person Didnt Catch It Is 7 days after exposure long enough for a Negative Blood Test Result to be 100 Correct It usualy appears within 7 to 12 days of being infected yes Unless your partner has it its more than likely youll test negative again Hi I found you this very interesting link this should help you understand things a lot better and be more informed The Link httpkidshealthorgteenyourbodyskinstuffcoldsoreshtml Do hope this helps you Good Luck Hi Ask anyone who gets cold sores and theyll tell you how unpleasant these little sores and blisters can be Cold sores which usually appear on your lips or the skin around your mouth are also known as oral herpes and are caused by the herpes simplex virus HSV This same virus is also responsible for blisters and sores in the genital area known as genital herpes Which raises the question if you have cold sores is it possible to give your partner genital herpes The short answer is yes says sexual health physician Terri Foran Lots of people have cold sores and lots of people have oral sex  so why dont more of us get genital herpes The reason is because during childhood most of us around 80 per cent are exposed to the herpes 1 virus says Foran Its usually the area around the mouth thats exposed and this means that you cant be reinfected with the virus anywhere else on your body All Care of httpwwwabcnetauhealthtalkinghealthfactbusterstories200907292638882htm So please toss a coin either just straight sex or away you go slurping away your sex life Good Luck Hi Genital herpes is usually contracted from skin to skin contact with an infected area The infection needs to be active on the skins surface for the infection to spread For example if someone has a genital herpes infection they could pass the virus onto another person by touching or making contact with the active infected area such as through vaginal anal or oral sex or by rubbing against the infection Friction heat and moisture as well as a break or tear in the skin could increase the chance of the herpes virus spreading Herpes is not spread by saliva semen blood or body fluids It is also not spread through toilet seats or sharing the same bed Dose this help you Good Luck Hi So if your that worried why dont you go to an STDGUM Clinic and get tested there the staff there will know just what

able to sort you out either way BV or herpes Hope this helps Good Luck See first answer Hi This is from John Hopkins Can herpes be transmitted to other parts of my body If you have genital herpes or orofacial herpes you cannot transmit the infection to another part of your body after the initial infection occurs If you have genital HSV II you will not get HSV II at another site in your body The body produces antibodies that protect other parts of your body from infection However there are cases where an individual has multiple site infections from the same virus This is usually acquired at the time of the initial infection For example if an individual has oral and genital sex with an infected partner they can acquire the infection at both sites because they are susceptible at that time As for your Carpal tunnel I have had both hands done and yes it will be sore for some time for now just make sure your not doing to much apart from clenching and flexing but dont do what I did and fall on it because that hurts the site for some time But just stay clam over your other problem Do hope this helps you Good Luck HI Below is from the Uks NHS it should help you to understand things more Genital herpes is a common infection caused by the herpes simplex virus HSV It causes painful blisters on the genitals and the surrounding areas As genital herpes can be passed to others through intimate sexual contact its often referred to as a sexually transmitted infection STI  HSV can affect any mucous membrane moist lining such as those found in the mouth  cold sores  Genital herpes is a chronic longterm condition The virus remains in your body and can become active again The average rate of recurrence is four to five times in the first two years after being infected However over time

link into google to open and read copy from www Hope t5his helps you and your gf Good Luck Hi This may be attributed to the physiological changes that women typically experience at the onset of menopause During menopause many women start to have more vaginal dryness due to a reduction in estrogen When there is not enough lubrication there are greater frictional forces during intercourse and we know friction causes herpes outbreaks While this new development of more frequent and regular outbreaks can come as an unwelcome surprise the good news is there are steps you can take to treat and manage this More lubrication during sex acts or masturbation with sex toys See your doctor about getting some estrogen to help overcome your dryness Do hope this helps you Good Luck Hi See Above Answer sorry it wont come up without a prompt glitch on WebMD Hi While HSV can be a frustrating and painful condition for some people in general the virus is less a medical problem than a social problem For most of us genital herpes is no more dangerous than a cold sore Most people with genital herpes dont know they have it and are unaware they may be spreading it to others Many have no symptoms or mistake their symptoms for something else such as jock itch insect bites hemorrhoids yeast infections razor burn or allergies to laundry detergent So yes it can stay hidden for years before it surfaces and shows up in tests Do hope this helps you Good Luck Hi They say swimming in the sea is very good for outbreaks so a good sea salt bath should work just as well a good couple of

affect the external area around the vagina called the vulva Its very unusual for shingles to affect the inside of the vagina itself but it can occur Shingles is the common name for herpes zoster the painful rash that results from reactivation of varicella virus in adulthood Most of us are infected by varicella virus as children when it causes chickenpox After we recover from chickenpox varicella doesnt disappear but rather goes dormant hiding inside nerves under our skin for years Later in life varicella can erupt on the skin to cause the painful rash called herpes zoster or shingles Varicella is in the herpes virus family but is distinct from HSV1 and HSV2 the herpes viruses that commonly affect the lips and genitals Varicella is much more likely to affect external skin than moist mucous membranes inside the mouth or vagina Ulcers or sores on the vagina are more often due to HSV1 or HSV2 herpes infections Taking a viral culture from the site of a fresh ulcer is the only way to know for sure though Do hope this helps you Good Luck Hi This first bit is from the NHS Genital herpes can cause painful red blisters or sores to appear around your genitals as well as an abnormal vaginal discharge See your GP or go to a genitourinary medicine GUM clinic as soon as possible You may be offered a course of antiviral tablets which will stop the herpes virus multiplying but the symptoms may have a tendency to return Now from me dose this discharge have to be from your herpes could something else BV Yeast infection or chlamydia Ok you can either have antibiotics or

httpgoaskalicecolumbiaeducoldsoresoralsexgenitalherpes Your find it vary interesting as it seems if you have one then it makes it difficult to catch the other Strange world we live in Good Luck Hi The answer to your question is no herpes is not transmitted through inanimate objects such as soap towels clothing bed sheets toilet seats and spa surfaces In the case of sharing soap the herpes virus would be washed away by the soap before it would have the chance to infect someone else One theoretically possible but highly unlikely scenario is contracting the herpes virus from a damp towel This could happen if an infected person rubs off a good amount of the virus onto a damp towel that is immediately used by an uninfected person who then wipes it against his or her mucous membranes The only problem would be using the razor straight after you friend has just used it just make sure its had a good wash first in soapy water Do hoper this helps you Good Luck Hi You have ingrowing hairs and there no problem abut itch like crazy now what you need to do is this open each one with a clean needle inside you should see the hair just flick it our and pluck it the same with all of them within

body so it cant really get to other parts Good Luck Hi See Above Answer Hi Could be BV or a yeast infection or chlamydia these all have a burning effect if its the first two you could try sea salt as a cure So what you do is have sea salt baths twice daily you put two handfuls of sea salt in a warm bath you need to let the water get inside your vagina for this to work you do this for a week by then it should be cured For chlamydia you could try Boric acid capsules just ask at your chemist for them I think they come in 300mg you just slip them into your vagina twice daily Do hope this helps Good Luck Hi OK your vaginal dryness could be the reason for the pain during sex Try vitamin B6 for your wetness or you could even take brewers yeast this way you get a complex of Bs Vitamin A and beta carotene through your doctor in a suppositorie its said to increase dryness when inserted into the vagina Do hope this helps Good Luck Hi This may help you in your search viral infections like epsteinBarr virus hepatitis virus herpes virus bacterial infections like Strep throat staph fungal infections respiratory infections urinary and gastrointestinal infections can all cause hives They do not cause hives directly but indirectly by causing inflammation from stimulating the bodys defence mechanisms Do hope this helps Good Luck Hi Have you thought of going top your doctor for one Im sure heshe can put a finger on it as to what it may be would be a lot better than sending a picture of your butt But if you think we need to see it just upload to a picture site you then send the link in

vaginosis OK you have a choice of to the doctor for some antibiotics or you could try boric acid capsules for this see your chemist and ask for them you can google bv and boric acid or you can have a look at this site for more help httpwwwmyhomeremediescomstaticyeastinfectionshtml Just copy into googel to see it its very interesting Do hope this helps Good Luck Hi In short yes it hides deep in body tissues and just pops out when it feels like it and shows up in a test Good Luck Hi Herpes and HIV do have a habit of hiding from tests this is because the hid in organs around your body Now Syphilis this is the bad one as you will see Acquired syphilis  This is generally transmitted through sex with an infected partner There are several stages Primary syphilis  This is the earliest stage and generally occurs from 10 days to 3 months after infection It typically causes a painless ulcer on the genitals Secondary syphilis  This is the second stage of syphilis Many different symptoms can occur see later but usually last several weeks They can however come and go for up to two years Latent hidden syphilis  This occurs after the symptoms of secondary syphilis have cleared With latent syphilis you have no symptoms Latent syphilis can last for many many years It is divided into two types Early latent syphilis  This lasts for a year or so and you are still infectious  that is you can pass syphilis on to other people Late latent syphilis  About two years after secondary syphilis has cleared you can become noninfectious and are no longer able to pass syphilis on to others Tertiary syphilis  This is the final stage of syphilis It can affect many organs of the body including the brain and heart It can result in death But I dont think you have this as you can see But next time you want sex just wear a condom it will save all the worries that your putting your self through now Do hope this helps Good Luck Hi This is from WebMD but dose seem you have both been let down but if you had both been thinking hygiene you would not be here Now from WebMD You can have a fulfilling sex life if you have genital herpes  even though it may  always use a latex condom for vaginal sex  anal sex  and receiving fellatio  Make sure you wash the toy before and after and dont share it Sorry for you both youve been ley down Good Luck Hi I thought I would copy this just for you its from the NHS in the UK Tells it like it is There are two types of herpes simplex virus HSV type 1 and type 2 Both types are highly contagious and can be passed easily from one person to another by direct contact Genital herpes is usually transmitted by having sex vaginal anal or oral with an infected person Even if someone with genital herpes does not have any symptoms it is possible for them to pass the condition on to a sexual partner So the answer is yes he can but he to like you would end up with Herpes Simplex Virus 2 if thats what he wants then carry on Do hope this helps Good Luck Hi Yes it is but you would only find out by getting tested for this either get to your doctor or get to an STDGUM Clinic this your only way out just hope it comes up a simple yeast infection Do hope this helps you Good Luck Hi Get yourself off to an STDGUM Clinic the staff will be really helpful to your problem if its a yeast infection thats gone wrong or an STD they will tell you can get you on the right meds for your problem This will help you Good Luck Hi Yes in can hid for years unless its being looked for the it wont be found but your find it does go deep did find this as well The Mayo Clinic notes that its possible for someone who experiences an initial outbreak to go 40 years before they have another Does this help you Good Luck Hi OK for a start if its jock itch this you can get rid of herpes is for life AS do you have herpes then just get to your local STDgum clinic and get some tests done simple as that Good Luck Hi Being an STI it means what it says its only passed that way You cannot get genital herpes from hugging sharing baths or towels from swimming pools toilet seats or from sharing cups plates or cutlery You should be safe an so your children Do hope this eases your pain Good Luck Yes I would until you and your partner gets medical help on safe ways to have sex without giving it to them if they dont have it Yes she is still contagious She is contagious at any stage of an outbreak While cold sores are most contagious when they are oozing fluid the virus can be transmitted even during times when she has no blisters Cold sores can spread to other parts of the body too Check trusted sites for more info httpwwwabrevacomcreamspreadingcoldsores httpwwwmayocliniccomhealthcoldsoreDS00358DSECTIONcauses httpwwwncbinlmnihgovpubmedhealthPMH0001631 You have to differentiate between what is likely and what is theoretically possible and what is the worst possible scenario if the thing that you do not want to happen happens For example it is normally accepted that people do not catch measles twice When we catch an infection we make antibodies to fight that infection and to prevent us from catching it again That said it is possible to find people who have caught measles twice so it is not impossible In the case of herpes simplex the virus is usually caught on one part of the body We even give it a different name if it is caught in a different place genital herpes or cold sore or whitlow on the finger or hand Though the virus may be confined to one dermatome our antibodies cover the whole body and usually prevent reinfection on different sites In other words our bodies are primed to prevent reinfection If reinfection does unusually happen it tends to happen to people whose immune systems are weakened by other infections or conditions and not to average healthy individuals If reinfection does take place and I stress it is rare then you will have caught a cold sore on the lip Around three quarters of adults have caught a facial cold sore infection by middle age and most of them notice little or nothing in the way of symptoms or recurrences Lets not get hysterical about the common cold sore Shedding is most likely to be happening in the first year or so and declines thereafter By its very nature shedding is virus on the skin at a low level so is unlikely to be present in sufficient quantity to overwhelm the immune system on a different part of the body of a person who already has antibodies Genital herpes is caused by a viral infection called herpes simplex virus Outbreaks consist of painful and itchy blisters however there is a wide range of symptoms Typically outbreaks are caused by emotional or physical stress such as heat cold sun exposure illness trauma and hormonal fluctuations So the answer to your question is yes It is important to know that herpes can be transmitted very easily and at any time with direct skin to skin contact You do not have to have a current outbreak to transmit herpes so it is important to practice safe sex If you have multiple outbreaks in a single year or are in a physical relationship with a partner who does not have herpes speak to your doctor about suppressive therapy Suppressive therapy would require that you take an antiviral medication on a daily basis which would decrease the number and intensity of outbreaks and also decrease the risk of transmitting the virus to your partner However it is important to realize that you may still transmit the virus even if you are on suppressive therapy I would recommend that you both be tested for herpes The most accurate way to test for herpes is with a blood test A cotton tip swab of an active blister can also be used to test for herpes Realize that herpes is not routinely tested for when you see a doctor for STD screening because it typically requires blood testing Usually just Chlamydia and Gonorrhea are tested for with a genital swab or with a urine sample It is very difficult to determine how long someone has had herpes and who had it first It is very possible that one or both of you has had the herpes virus for a long time without knowing Some people have the virus yet do not exhibit symptoms but can still transmit the infection during sexual contact It is important that you know if you test positive for the virus because if you do not have it and your partner does then you are at risk of acquiring the infection If this is the case your partner should be on antiviral suppressive therapy and should be using a condom during intercourse Herpes simplex virus 2 HSV2 IGM refers to current infection or outbreak So this would be postive if you recently have had or currently have a herpetic outbreak Whereas HSV2 IGG refers to a previous infection which means that you have been infected with the herpes virus and are therefore able to transmit the virus to someone else Once you have the virus like all viruses you will have it forever Essentially a positive IGG and negative IGM means you have the virus but not a current or recent outbreak If you have frequent outbreaks or if your partner tests negative for herpes it is very important that you start suppresive antiviral therapy to prevent outbreaks and to decrease the risk of transmitting the virus Realize that even if you are on suppresive medication you can still pass the virus on to your partner so using a condom is also very important If she is taking meds for it otherwise it could just be dorment right now She could always have a flare up From what I understand you cannot pass it along if it is not active You could always speak to your family doc about it if you have concerns good luck Actually insomnia is not the proper word My trouble is mostly getting a good quality of sleep rather than falling asleep I dont have too much trouble falling asleep but I dont drift away too easily either Yesthere is a correlation Chicken pox shingles and other forms of herpes cold soresfever blisters and even genital herpes are ALL caused by the same herpes virus Genital herpes tends to stay on the genitals and not spread to other areas on YOUR bodyGenital herpes is typically spread genitalstogenitals from one person to another It is always a good policy to wash your hands after scratching your genitals whether you have herpes or not Herpes is caused by a virus and those viruses can spread to others from freshly contaminated hands There are antiviral medications that can reduce the frequency of your infectionslike Famvir or acyclovir They require a prescription and it appears that you should be on those fulltime for a while Not really Genital herpes is best treated with a prescription antiviral medication You can try the llysine if you want but scientific studies have not proven it to be efficacious Yesa person can have or contract both herpes simplex cold sore on the lips AND have genital herpes type 2 caused by sexual contact No You can wash your clothes together if you want Cervical cancer may have an underlying cause such as HPV human papilloma virus but I would have no idea if this man also has HPV Herpes is an entirely different type of infection that does not cause cervical cancer but can be transmitted to you during sex A condom would offer a reasonable but not 100 protection against herpes No genital herpes is spread by genital contact not by a glass or straw Oral herpes can be spread that way but not if you only have genital lesions Herpes simplex lesions depending on where they occur on the body like the lips or genitals will appear a groups of tiny waterfilled blisters They tend to be painful or itch before they break out and can easily spread over the local skin surface As those blisters break they will scab over It is best NOT to break those virusfilled blisters or pick at these wounds until they are properly diagnosed It is best to see a medical provider or have a lab test for confirmation that this is indeed herpes simplex Search WebMD for more information about herpes You should be able to find many photographs on the Internet by putting herpes photo in your search engine Herpes is the same virus that causes chicken pox and shingles herpes zoster Both The virus can be spread in both ways If you have an active herpes lesion and are smoking the cigarette butt could have live herpes virus on it If a child or anyone for that matter puts this butt in their mouth the virus can be transmitted Not all exposure to herpes will result in disease so cross your fingers Last comment Hopefully you are not smoking around a child and leaving your cigarette butts where a child can get to them Prostatitis should not cause rednesssoreness at the tip of the penis so you are correct There is likely another cause Unfortunately it would not be possible to determine a specific cause blindly over the Internet based solely on your very brief description You will need to see your medical provider again not just because of this rednesssoreness but because you apparently have not responded to three weeks of antibiotics for your prostatitis You may want to consider seeing a urologist The only good thing about genital herpes is that it is well contained You can only spread this disease by direct genital contact with another person or through oral sex There is absolutely no reason why this person cannot be around children or other peoplegenital herpes will not transmit through clothing Genital herpes is spread by genital contact Oral herpes cold sores fever blisters is spread by oral contact Genitaloral contact can cause herpes to spread if ONE partner has active lesions but if you do not have oral lesions you cannot spread it to his genitals unless of course he already has it Unfortunately I cant can see or examine you Your description is vague I can tell you that herpes tends to be tiny waterfilled blisters not white pimples that come in clusters not just one You may have a mucous cyst but that is just a blind guess You would need to see a medical provider or dentist for a definitive answer Only if he sat on fresh herpes in the public restroom immediately developed herpes himself in this area not possibleand you kissed him highly unlikely in the exact area of infection Try kissing him on the face or lips next time If one partner has active herpes the transmission to another person is possible via direct genital contact or contact by hands Nofolliculitis is an inflammation andor infection of hair follicles It is not a form of herpes Herpes is transmitted by direct contact with the skin or mucous membrane It can be easily transmitted during sex but not through the ejaculate You tell them with honesty and remorse if you are the one that exposed them Remember that exposure does not always end up causing disease in another person Maybe they wont get itor maybe they already had herpes and didnt tell you Clearly when you tell someone that you may have inadvertently exposed them to a sexual transmitted disease it will not be easy Both of you are a bit responsible however since it appears you may not have practice safe sex no condoms If you just found out where did you get it Open and honest communication in a private area not work is important Some facts 1 Herpes is not the only STD out there 2 Condoms protect against STDs like Chlamydia gonorrhea HIV etc 3 Both you and your boyfriend have had previous partners It doesnt take much for either one of your to stray even though you may pledge monogamy All it takes is a bad argument sometimes 4 Condoms are cheap I vote that you continue to use condoms until both of you are 100 committed to an honest permanent relationship and you are 100 sure than neither one of you has any other type of latent STD that has not reared its ugly head Herpes would not be high on a diagnostic list based on what you have described While it would be impossible to blindly offer you a definitive answer without examining you more likely possibilities would include chaffing like you mentioned or a fungal skin infection tinea cruris also known as jock itch  a common skin condition that occurs in warm dark moist skin areas You would need to see a medical provider if this condition persists or worsens This is really the only way to be properly diagnosed and treated Theoretically you can transfer a type one herpes virus the cold sore to your own genitals during the first primary infection when the viral shedding was very high and your immune system was very vulnerable butthat is not very likely I have to say that the way you probably got genital herpes the old fashioned way through sexual contact Autoinnoculation giving it to yourself is something that is biologically possible but extremely rare I have never seen it Some people with herpes are surprisingly oblivious I have conclusively diagnosed many people with herpes who thought they just had a rash or a sore area from the rubbing of clothing It is even possible and scientifically proven that herpes can be transmitted even when the partner does not have an active or obvious outbreak Most of the people who get herpes were not aware that they were exposed since their partner  sometimes their ONLY partner did not have a clue they had it Will you have it for life Yes unfortunately but the number of outbreaks could be quite infrequent or not The bodys immune systems usually does a great job keeping herpes at bay You should inform any partner that you have it regardless There are some good antiviral drugs if taken regularly that can reduce the outbreak incidences and the amount of viral shedding that could affect others Talk to your medical provider about it You bet Just look for latexfree condoms If you cant find them on the shelves at the grocery store or pharmacy just ask for them You can also buy them online Yes so dont use anyones razorespecially someone who is known to have herpes simplex Yesthat is possible Your immune system suppresses the herpes virus and leaves it dormant You still have the capability of a flairup anytime in your life however since the virus is still theresleeping You have most likely treated Chlamydia effectively regardless of the location of the incident but your Herpes will last forever Anal sex has its own risks so you will need to disclose this information to your medical provider to make sure you have not contracted any other sexuallytransmitted disease like condylomata anal warts Ever heard of condoms Use em There is nothing typical or predictable about herpes or the antiviral drugs that are used to suppress outbreaks Every person and their response to herpes and suppressant medictions is different You have stopped taking your acyclovir so you may know those answers as they pretain to you if you have a genital form of herpes and it was properly diagnosed recurrent outbreaks can happen and they are likely to be in the same place Typically subsequent outbreaks could be lesssevere but it will not likely be just a cold sore No herpes is herpes and HIV is HIVthey are not related although they can be contracted the same way and even at the same time Herpes will not turn into HIV but you should be tested for it Having unprotected sex with someone who has herpes puts you at a definite risk Washing off afterwards is not going to offer you any protection Why are you having unprotected sex I would say you are NOT good to go until you get cleared by your STD testing AND you buy a ready supply of condoms and start using themfor your protection and the protection of your partners There is no way for me to know the true nature of your lesion scab or STD based on description This requires an examination by someone skilled with diagnosing STDs of all types Yes the herpes virus can be spread this wayor not A person is never sure when they are shedding the virus and the recipient would need to be susceptible at the time Noit would be highly unlikely for you to contract herpes in this odd way Unfortunately yes There is always a small risk even with condoms and even avoiding sex during an outbreakit depends on the location of his herpes and the extent of your sexual activity The risk is quite small with these precautions but it is not zero No This is not likely There is no empirical evidence that bed bugs spread shingles from one person to the next You will probably be just finehandwashing and intact skin on your hands is an excellent defense against the transmission of viruses That was a nice act of kindness the money not the lighter It would be highly highly unlikely that this brief touching of the hands would result in you contracting any disease Dont be bummed out pun intended I dont knowyou didnt post the LOCATION of this gland or lymph node For genital herpes this is usually in the groin area It is probably your current boyfriend just a guess but your previous boyfriend could have spread it to you as well and the virus has not reared its ugly head until now Needless to say ONE of them gave it to you and you are partially responsible too since you permitted unprotected sex If your current boyfriend refuses to be tested this is just a like a suspected drunk driver refusing a blood alcohol test According to the law refusal to be tested is equivalent to guilt Since herpes often accompanies other STDs you would be wise to be tested for more than just herpes A person with diabetes is considered immunocompromised especially if their diabetes is not in control Any infection in a diabetic could possibly be worse more difficult to treat etc so genital herpes may fall in that catagory Please keep in mind that all people are different in their response to illnesses Yesgenital herpes will be recurrent for the rest of your life They will eventually go away from this outbreak but there are prescription medications that may make any future outbreaks less often although three years since your last outbreak is good and reduce some of the discomfort that you are experiencing now I am assuming this is genital herpes but since I do not know your sex or the extent of your outbreak it really is impossible to offer you any patientspecific advice I can offer you some general suggestion You may find that an antiinflammatory medication like ibuprofen to be more effective than what you are taking Short of seeking medical care in the country you are in and using some cold compresses there is little that can be done Herpes is a virus that tends to run its own course from a mild outbreak to a severe one If you are female you may also want to cover the area with some petrolatum jelly Vaseline to limit the burning effect when you urinate wear loose cotton undies and curse the person who gave it to you yet again Maybe Many people who contract herpes are from partners that do not show any signs of active disease so most clinicians feel that the herpes virus is capable of shedding even during dormant periods How do you know your partner doesnt have it Did he tell you Some cases of herpes can so minor that a person may misdiagnose themselves as just having a rash or irritation Genital herpes is sexuallytransmitted in 999 of the cases and a person does not have to be actively infected at the time to pass it on It is very difficult to know the exact type of herpes so oral herpes fever blisters cold sores can be transmitted to the genital area during oral sex If you have only had ONE partner then the source is likely that one partner If you have had more than one then it could have been any of them Any skin lesion in or near the genital area should be evaluated A description alone does not rule out or accurately diagnose genital herpes but based on what you have posted it seems less likely It may be folliculitis  an infection of a hair follicle but without the ability to exam a patient this is only a guess If you are concerned it is going to take an examination and perhaps a diagnostic test like a culture to provide you with the assurance that you deserve Based on the information in your posting it does not seem likely that this would be herpes let alone a genital herpes The most likely cause would be a contact dermatitis how in the world would you get poison ivy here anyway It could be some residual chemicals in a laundry detergent soap dryer softeners or even the elastic band of your underclothingmany things Instead of Benadryl which can cause some sensitivity reactions itself a trial of hydrocortisone may be helpful There is really no way to medical prove as specific cause if it is a contact dermatitis Herpes on the skin is painful It is composed of groups of tiny waterfilled blisters that rupture The area surrounding these tiny blisters is red and irritated It can itch but pain and tingling would be a more common symptom There are certainly other considerations so I am pleased you are seeing a medical provider for a handson examination If you do not have active lesions at the time of your test not sure what KIND of STD tests you hadnot all of them even check for herpes it could have been a false negative test If you are continuing to have unprotected sex you could have picked up herpes 2 anytime There are no laboratory tests that will prove when you got it Water transmission would not be highly unlikelyunless of course you are doing more than just bathing in that tub Oral herpes fever blisters cold soresyes Genital herpesno Genital herpes is spread by sexual contact Noherpes is not in the blood If you were accurately diagnosed with genital herpes then you know it is possible People can spread genital herpes even when they are not actively infected The condom only protects agains penile lesions but someone can have herpetic lesions in places that are not covered by the condom A person gets genital herpes from sexual activity so this is how you got it but I have no idea the exact mechanism of exposure or the person that exposed you Sadly yes You can pass herpes type 1 or 2 to your children so it would be wise to hold off on kissing them when you have a lip lesion breakout When you have genital lesions you should consider taking some suppression medicine antiviral drugs to limit your outbreaks and exercise some caution when touching these lesions or sharing towels Herpes can be spread even when you do not have active lesions but this is less common There is a good chance that your children may get exposed to herpes simplex from one of their classmates at some time in their young lives so if they do get it it may not be from you exclusively Genital herpes is painful VERY painful since the herpetic virus involves the nerves in this area Hopefully your medical provider has given you the appropriate antiherpetic medications as well as something for pain This may last for a while and genital herpes tends to be recurrent The antiherpetic medications will help reduce future outbreaks too Different viruses Herpes simplex virus is called HSV Human Papilloma virus is called HPV I guess a person who has not practiced safesex throughout their lives can have bothor more STDs Herpes is not silly and no there are not cures There are not cures fo the common cold most cancers and a zillion other human afflictions Herpes is just on the list Perhaps there will be a cure someday but right now there are some definite limits to medical science when it comes to conquering viruses Scientists are working on a vaccine but it is years away There are some effective antiviral medications that can limit the outbreaks however so if you are afflicted this may be something for you to consider No usually Herpes is a cluster of painful blisters To my knowledge there is that has been scientifically established between genital herpes and prostate cancer Absolutely not This strong steroid cream can actually make an herpetic outbreak WORSE There are better ways to treat this condition so please consult your medical provider for the proper prescriptions Yes bathing is not contraindicated and will not spread the infection to other areas While it would be highly unlikely for a herpes infection to remain in bathtub it would be good to clean and sanitize the tub for the next person Take a bit of caution with drying off A towel can be quite abrasive to this sensitive area so consider airdrying or using a warm setting on a blow dryer instead of contaminating a towel The virus can remain on certain surfaces especially damp ones for a short period of time so a bit of caution is needed Hopefully you are taking a good antiviral medication to treat this condition and limit future outbreaks Surebut not during an active outbreak Oral herpes typically is caused by direct contact like kissing or by fresh exposure to the herpes virus as a fomite contaminated surfaces Technically if the person using the mouse has an active herpetic lesion on the lip picks at it and then touches the mouse it will be contaminated If you then touch the mouse and touch your lip AND are susceptible to herpes you may get it These are all big Ifs and theoretical Most people have have oral herpes have no clue where they got it or from whom Genital herpes comes from sexual contact orally or during intercourse Lesscommonly it could come from shared contaminated sex toys but this is not the typical transmission route You can use your own wireless mouse or at least wipe it off before using it Of course the keyboard desk a pen etc is going to be a possible fomite as well Herpes where Genital herpes can be effectively treated by several different antiviral medications Shingles and cold soresfever blisters are also herpes and may be treated differently See your medical providerwarm water is not going to really do much Yes if the herpetic lesions are active and you are susceptable CO2 treatment on the face should have nothing to do with genital herpes especially if your herpes is not active You would need to ask the dermatologist WHY this question is even asked I have never heard that genital herpes was a contraindication for facial treatments Maybe The herpes virus can remain viable on wet or damp surfaces for quite a while To get it this way a person would a have to be particularly vulnerable to getting herpes and b have a fresh contact  someone with a very active herpetic lesion perhaps on their buttocks In the vast majority of cases herpes is spread the good ol fashioned way Of course If your husband has herpes and you have NOT used a condom you may have already been infected Herpes is more contagious when the herpes lesions are fresh but herpes can also be transmitted when there are not obvious lesions If you have not shown any signs of herpes so far and you have had unprotected intercourse then you have been very fortunate Using condoms will usually protect from genital herpes assuming the lesions are typically contained on the part of the penis that is covered by a condom Herpes can also break out on any groin area No not really Once you have genital herpes and have recurrent outbreaks you will always have herpes Those blisters should not be intentionally broken or popped but if they spontaneously rupture this fluid will not likely worsen the outbreak or cause more outbreaks Hopefully you are taking antiviral medications to limit the frequency and severity of your outbreaks Those diseases are not biologically related expect that they are sexuallytransmitted Herpes infection in the mouth is not necessarily sexuallytransmitted but genital herpes certainly is I am not exactly clear on your question but Shingles also called herpes zoster is a form of herpesthe same virus that causes chicken pox fever blisterscold sores and genital herpes Without the ability to see this scab firsthand please dont post a picture it would be very difficult if not impossible to offer you a patientspecific recommendation The penis is covered by skin and skin can become irritated for a variety of reasons so I would suggest that you see a medical professional to have this allimportant examination Sex toys can spread STDs so it would be wise to use new ones or ones that are carefully and thoroughly sanitized Herpes can remain viable on objects for many hours The fact that you and your partner BOTH have genital herpes would make me question if you are both virgins Someone may not be telling the whole truth Yes the transmission of the herpes virus can be oralgenital There are many different causes of vaginal irritation so before getting to worried see your medical provider or womens health professional for a proper examination diagnosis and treatment The toilet seat is possible but girls using the toilet typically do not have these parts directly touching the seat If the herpetic lesions were on her buttocks or legs it would be more possible You cannot get or transmit genital herpes by drinking or eating after someonejust direct contact As long as she keeps her hands clean after using the toilet and of course keeps the bathroom toilet spotless you will be safe Autism has absolutely nothing to do with genital herpes Your genital herpes was caused by sexual contact with another person who has genital herpes assuming your diagnosis was correct I have no way of knowing if you were misdiagnosed Assuming you have the medical skills to examine someones hands to rule out a herpetic lesion herpetic whitlow keep in mind that a person can shed the herpes viruses like from shingles etc when an active lesion is not obvious Unfortunately you can Genital herpes can end up on your mouth through oral sex for instance And it is possible for this to happen even when you do not have active lesions This is the chance that you will both need to take if this was your underlying concern You have most likely seen many people with cold soresor fever blisters These are typically type 1 herpes lesions but you can get type 2 lesions genital types on your mouth With that said you are both actively producing antibodies to suppress the genital outbreaks Theoretically this should limit the spread to other areas but not totally eliminate the possibility The fact that you both have herpes not at least solves part of the problem If one of you has active lesions I am sure that sexual activity would not be high on your todo list at least until you are better Are you both taking suppression drugs These are daily antiherpes medicines you can take to limit recurrent outbreaks Not necessarily This could be a type 1 herpes lesion herpes simplex or even shingles Type 2 lesions are typically in the genital area No your saliva is not always carrying the herpes viruses Most of the time you are capable of speading the virus when you have an active lesion although there is some evidence that this virus can spread even when there is not an active lesion To make your life simple dont kiss anyone when you have a herpes lesion on your lip but otherwise kiss them without guilt Yes you can get a meningitis vaccination and no you are not more likely to get meningitis if you have herpes Herpes simplex virus can be spread in that manner IF this person had herpes and you were susceptible to getting it Since many people have antibodies for herpes already from a past infection even from a child you may not be susceptible If you are then keep in mind that not all exposed people will get it If you were exposed only time will tellherpes can take several weeks to a few months after exposure before you may see an herpetic break out Sadly brushing your teeth using Listerine and wiping off that pipe beforehand did not lower your risk Herpes zoster shingles can occur in this area assuming your outbreak is only on ONE side of your body Although condoms really help herpes can be transmitted to any genital or oral surface not just the penis that is covered by a condom Herpetic lesions can occur on the area around the base of the penis the testicles the anal area and certainly in or around the mouthnose When your girlfriend has active herpes this is the most contagious period You are not describing herpes and yes these very painful ulcers can involve your tonsils A white spot may simply be a tonsillith tonsil stone a common accumulation of food and other debris that can get trapped in little holes on your tonsillar surface Since I cant see it this is only a guess Herpes does not cause or contribute to bacterial vaginosis Vaginal odor could be BVor trichomonasor even an impacted tampon so it would be best to see your medical provider so you can be properly examined and diagnosed BV can be cured with the right medical regime I am not sure what your doctors are using but this is not a difficult problem to treat You can keep getting it back however if it is coming from the same sexual source Exposure to an infectious disease like herpes does not automatically imply that you will get it Many people not all will shed the herpes virus even when they do not have an active outbreak some will only shed virus when they have an active lesion So far you have lucked out but it is not possible to determine how long your luck will continue since you may or may not have been exposed If you get genital herpes you will know it Neither If you have herpes in your EYE you need to be seen by an ophthalmologist  There is a prescription acyclovir that can be used but your Valtrex will likely do the job It will clear up but outbreaks can occur in the future Genital herpes tends to stay in the same area with each outbreak but subsquent outbreaks may be less severe Yes it can be only on the scrotum a fact that many men who use condoms to prevent herpes find difficult to accept If you have it only on your scrotum it may not spread to the penis There is always an increased risk of transmission even with the care that was exercised A person with herpes is clearly more contagious during an active outbreak but shedding of the virus can occur even when an outbreak is not obvious Herpes viruses can remain on objects for hours While the chance of transmission may be very small because of the caution that was exercised it would not be zero I really dont have enough information to help youlike the TYPE of herpes you have and the location of your breakouts My advice would be different if you had occasional type 1 lesions on your lip or if you are talking about a sexuallytransmitted genital type 2 form Please repost your question with more information Yes Herpes is notoriously PAINFUL not itchy However without the ability to see this bump firsthand it would not be possible to really provide that answer You would need to see your medical provider especially if you are at risk for sexuallytransmitted disease and this bump persists or worsens Herpes is an STD of course It is characterized by painful blisters and those blisters can be on the head of the penis Although I have no way of diagnosing him over the Internet there is good chance that this is indeed herpes He should be medically examined to be sure No there is nothing over the counter that will really help genital herpes Sorry Llysine has not been scientifically proven to shorten the course of herpes even though many people like you will take it I am sorry but I cant help you out with the dosage since I dont use it with my patients He is your fiance Be honest and just tell him the truth I remember a similar situation with one of my patients When she finally got the nerve to tell him he was relieved He had contracted herpes himself years before and was afraid to tell  Not all people who get exposed to herpes will get it You are on suppression medications for herpes I assume so the chance of an subsequent outbreak is lesslikely but still possible Obviously if you know you are having signs of an outbreak you should avoid sex at that time Some studies have shown that it is possible to transmit this virus to another person even if you to not have active lesions but this is lesslikely as well This is the risk that both of you will need to take If both of you had sexual partners in the past you may have been equally as exposed to the potential of getting an sexuallytransmitted disease You may have been the unlucky one but honesty will go a long long way in your new relationship if you just tell him Somebody is not telling the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help me God Unless there were some extraordinary circumstances genital herpes is caused by sexual contact Period Many times a person can transmit genital herpes to another without having any obvious lesions As a matter of fact may people who contract herpes is from someone who may not have even been aware they had it Yesyou could have gotten it from your first sexual partner who did not disclose a previous partner If the contact person actually had active herpes the change of getting it is high If the person had herpes that was dormant the chances are less I dont have enough information to be more specific If you are not a gambling person perhaps it would be best NOT to have unprotected sex in the future so you dont have to worry so much Honesty is always the best policy I am sure YOU would want to know if your partner had herpes and your partner should know if you have herpes You may be surprises to find that you both have a history of herpes If not the uninfected partner can take measures to prevent transmission to them I know it can be embarrassing or even relationshipthreatening to disclose this but it is the right thing to do There have even been some successful lawsuits filed against a person who knowing gave another a sexuallytransmitted disease Having a safe and healthy sexual relationship starts with honest communication including disclosure of a past herpetic infection and the importance of using condoms Remember that herpes is not the only sexuallytransmitted disease out there Genital herpes in the genitals You cannot transmit the virus from the genital through your mouth unless of course you also had oral herpes cold sores fever blisters They are very different Trichomoniasis is a parasitic infection that is easily cured with the proper treatment Herpes is a viral infection that basically lasts forever It can be treated the virus can be medicallysuppressed and it usually goes into remission but the infection even in a dormant stage lasts a lifetime It most likely means that no herpes virus or DNA was detected I dont know the KIND of herpes test that you had or anything about the reason you had this test in the first place so it would be best to have the medical provider who ordered this particular test to carefully explain the results Not all tests are 100 accurate There are some falsenegative results Shingles are caused by the herpes virus Cold sores are also caused by the herpes virus Canker sores and HPV are NOT herpetic No You cannot get genital herpes this way No but a person could have both since they are two different diseases Nonot unless you sex in a hot tub or pool Herpes will not spread through the water only by direct contact You can go to an urgent care facility and PAY for the visit and lab test or try and find a free clinic Sometimes there are public health facilities that will do lowcost STD testing yes unless you have an outbreak on your nipple If you decide to breast feed and have a genital or oral out break handle with care if you have a red blister that is fluid filled burns stings itches and hurts like a SOB then its quite possible warm H2O helps w the pain but it will have to be cultured by your dr to know for sure if it craters after the blister is gone then probably so dont have sex until you know for sure If you both have HSV 2 herpes type 2 there is nothing to worry about in terms of transmitting between the two of you that is correct But it would be good to know that neither of you have any other STDs right Testing might be appropriate for you both Herpes doesnt travel around your body like that Certainly the genital and anal areas could be herpes but I would be very surprised if those on your torso are herpes If you wonder more you should have them swab tested when they appear Also herpes doesnt usually recur in the mouth but rather on the outside of the mouth Sores in the mouth are more often canker sores not caused by herpes virus I would recommend speaking to him as soon as possible I talked to my now husband very early on as soon as I saw that things were getting serious but before they got sexual I gave him the facts told him he was free to leave if he wasnt comfortable  no harm no foul He wasnt interested in going anywhere but was appreciative that I spoke up about it I take medication every day and double up during outbreaks but you are right the threat of spreading it to him is certainly there He has read up on the issue and is more informed now and supportive I recommend having some websites available or printouts with you  ready to give him when discussing the condition Sometimes our fear of disclosure is overblown It also gives us a chance to be upfront and honest with our partner about things that happened to us prior to meeting them that were not our choice not our wish but we are dealing with and hoping in sharing with our new love to have their support so we can deal with the issue together Good luck Unless no one has ever kissed you and unless youve never had sex it is possible that youve picked up an oral or genital herpes virus Oral herpes usually caused by the herpes simplex virus type 1 HSV1 shows up as cold sores or fever blisters on the mouth Even a casual peck on the lips from someone with a cold sore can give you the virus Thats why its so common As many as 50 to 80 of adults in the US have oral herpes Genital herpes most often caused by the second type of herpes virus HSV2 is less common but plenty of people still have it Roughly one in five American adults has genital herpes But up to 90 of those who have it dont know they are infected You could be one of them Yes there are several tests for genital herpes A doctor can take a sample from what appears to be a herpes sore and examine it under a microscope You can also have a blood test The blood test looks for antibodies to the virus that your immune system would have made when you were infected HSV2 almost always infects the genitals so if antibodies to HSV2 are detected in your blood you probably have genital herpes It is difficult to tell from the blood test when you were first infected with HSV however A blood test that shows antibodies to HSV1 means you could have genital or oral herpes Thats because oral herpes typically caused by HSV1 can be spread to the genitals during oral sex There is no cure for herpes Unless scientists find one in the future you will always have the virus But taking antiviral drugs can help manage your condition Ask your doctor about treatment options Many people say that an extract of the echinacea plant helps boost the immune systems ability to fight the genital herpes infection Some say it decreases the frequency and severity of genital herpes outbreaks Researchers in the UK compared the effect of echinacea with that of a placebo there was no significant difference in the number of herpes outbreaks Another study showed that an ointment containing propolis a waxy substance that honeybees make may help genital herpes sores heal Sores healed faster for people using the propolis ointment than in those using ointments containing the antiviral drug acyclovir or a placebo Researchers have also found that the herb Prunella vulgaris and an edible mushroom Rozites caperata the gypsy mushroom contain chemicals that fight both the oral herpes virus HSV1 and the genital herpes virus HSV2 These treatments have not been approved for treating genital herpes by the FDA You can buy them in stores but they are considered nutritional supplements not drugs so they are not subjected to the same quality standards as FDAapproved drugs Herpes simplex type 1 which is transmitted through oral secretions or sores on the skin can be spread through kissing or sharing objects such as toothbrushes or eating utensils In general a person can only get herpes type 2 infection during sexual contact with someone who has a genital HSV2 infection It is important to know that both HSV1 and HSV2 can be spread even if sores are not present Pregnant women with genital herpes should talk to their doctor as genital herpes can be passed on to the baby during childbirth For many people with the herpes virus attacks or outbreaks of herpes can be brought on by the following conditions General illness from mild illnesses to serious conditions Fatigue Physical or emotional stress Immunosuppression due to AIDS or such medications as chemotherapy or steroids Trauma to the affected area including sexual activity Menstruation Often its hard to tell by looking The textbook symptom of genital herpes is a cluster of small fluidfilled blisters that break forming painful sores that crust and heal during several days Affected areas include the penis scrotum vagina vulva urethra anus thighs and buttocks But many people dont get these sores Some people have no symptoms at all while others get symptoms that can be easily mistaken for razor burn pimples bug bites jock itch hemorrhoids an ingrown hair or a vaginal yeast infection After youre infected the symptoms go away but can flare up from time to time Luckily the first outbreak usually is the worst And some people may have just one or two outbreaks in their lifetime  The classic symptom of genital herpes is a cluster of small fluidfilled blisters that break forming painful sores that crust and heal This process can take several days But some people get only a rash or small bumps on the skin that appear to be pimples Still others have different symptoms such as painful urination and some women have fluid discharge from the vagina Sores may appear four to seven days after a person is first infected Flulike symptoms including fever and swollen lymph glands in the groin may also follow the initial infection Symptoms come and go with no set pattern One person may have an outbreak once a year while another may have one every few weeks Before a flareup a person may notice an itching tingling or burning sensation in the affected area and there may be sharp pains in the pelvis or down the leg Herpes sores are usually worst the first time they appear In later outbreaks the sores tend to be less painful and last for a shorter period of time The symptoms of genital herpes can affect any of the following places on the body Penis Scrotum Vulva Vagina Anus Urethra Thighs Buttocks However many people with genital herpes never have symptoms or they mistake them for another malady such as A vaginal yeast infection Jock itch Insect bites Hemorrhoids An ingrown hair Maybe If you want to be positive go to a docter You said the person has herpes so the answer would be most certainly not unless heshe dipped hisher genitals into the sauce Even then it probably wouldnt be a problem It takes intimate contact to contract herpes Dr Moser thanks for your answer Trying to reply to your post but cant seem to do that Im new to WebMD so Ill post an answer Answer is no neither of us are taking meds Ive been reading about the various meds Wondering which ones you would recommend and why FYI I never have outbreaks but she does Two since contracting it from me 4 months ago Thank you I believe NO only during active out breaks they can be spread just like the common cold sore httpwwwdatingsitesforherpescomstdinformation if you want know more about this you can ask for doctor for help too It is my understanding that HSV1 oral type is what causes fever blisters on your mouth Tons of people I know have this and you can get it from kissing sharing a drinking glass sharing utensilsfrom sharing towels etc  if you have blisters Cold sores are cause by herpes simplex virus type 1 If you have type 2 I dont think you could have gotten it from your parents It is my understanding that in no way can genitial herpes cause you to stop having periods Your period can trigger herpes outbreaks but the opposite is not true Herpes outbreaks will not cause you to stop having periods I would talk to my doctor Hope you feel better From everything I have read you cannot Only direct skin to skin contact The only thing that is questionable is via sex toys  Im not totally sure about that one I actually found a link to a discussion where people were talking about this in detail on WebMD httpforumswebmdcom3sexualconditionsandstdsexchangeforum4584 Hope this helps Of course youre safe Who ever heard of getting an STD AT A MASSAGE PARLOR having herpes for a long time you can go without an outbreak for a long time Anything can bring it on even stress change of diet just about anything you should have nothing to worry about Outbreaks can just pop up anytime for no reason at all You are okay I have it too Dnt worry went through the same thing and my doctor explained that to me herpies cant be cured when you contract herpies it can be treated so you are not infectious but just like cold sores they will return the virus can lay dormant for many years before returning if you are having any symptoms i suggest you contact your doctor for more treatment If a man already has genital herpes and he passed the herpes on to his female partner he could get sores on his face or mouth Its kind of the same philosophy as you can get sores on your face if you use a towel on your crotch and then on your face during an outbreak Yes herpes can be spread when there is no outbreak There is always a possibility WebMD has some really good information if you look around a bit NOHARD is rightyou need to shave with the way the hair grows not against it please I am not an MD but I asked my doctor the same exact question a few years ago He said herpes is a bloodborne virus that can be transferred at ANY time and the only sure way to avoid contracting it is to avoid sexual intercourse with someone who is infected Do you have small lesions near or in your private area They start out small and will be red then grow a little larger and have a white pimple like top The first outbreak is usually the most uncomfortable and actually hurts burns and itches Subsequent breakouts will not be as painful as the initial breakout Hello I spent the last 3 months having herpes like symptoms and after a series of tests  doctors it was finally discovered that I had an E Coli infection on the skin around my genitals It was very painful caused similar symptoms as herpes with tingling ulcers etc but easily addressed with antibiotics I would encourage your doctor to not only test for herpes but to swab for a bacterial or yeast infection as it may be something more benign than what you think it is Dont get too overwhelmed by what you read on the internet until you have something properly diagnosed I know it can be months of agony but hang in there i have type genital herpes as well going on 3 and a half years i am still a bit confused as to the difference between type 1 and 2 i do believe my is 2 but everything i have read once you have one you cant get the other thought you can make it spread to the mouth and eyes i have read i take very good care of myself since getting it and i have not spread it to myself farther or to another person i do avoid sex when i have an outbreak and i have never took the meds expect the 1st time stress is a factor along with poor health can cause outbreaks yes if they have an active outbreak just dont do it to be safe Yes The herpes virus remains in your body forever check with your Dr for HPV virus yes Totally avoid sex w him If you get checked annually and there was nothing wrong obviously he is the one that is infected Dont know if you know this but herpes is treatable not curable So be careful Okay so Type 1 is common to oral area and Type 2 is common to genital area You just have Type 1 on your genitals It will not turn into Type 2 Your test will always come back positive for Type 1 no matter where on your body it shows up Typical outbreaks happen during stressful or extra moist for prolong periods of time Herpes outbreaks will become less frequent the longer you have had it Your partner is always at risk whether you have an active outbreak or not  You can pass it days before you notice an outbreak Be honest with your partner  as you know this is a life long disease Always let your OBGYN knowwhen you decide to have a baby they will give you a daily supressive med to keep from passing along to your child OR you can opt for a Csection Good Luck God Bless and hope this helped httpwwwimagesofherpesblogspotcom2013051herpesdatingsitepositivesingleshtml httpwwwimagesofherpesblogspotcom Genital herpes pics I dont know why but over the 20 years Ive had it  Ive noticed as soon as I change out of my clothing from the day I have this problem I just figured it must have something to do with the area suddenly being exposed to oxygen Ive learned to not wear tight jeans during a breakout to avoid agitation Is the medicine Zovirax or something like that Do you have pills also Do you think you could have washed in the shower a little too roughly When Ive gotten them mine are actually Herpes but called them Boils for years because my husband wouldnt accept it until I made him go with me for a test last year I do realize we get regular ole boils also However Ive never heard of bleeding If the sore is currently Open I would stop the medicine for a day then start back again and see how it does Alternatively I wish you could see or talk to a Nurse or Dr but if youre on here you may not be able to do that Another thing Ive found soothing is putting a warm Chamomile tea bag on there for 12 hour I got that from hubby he brings me a bowl of hot water to keep rinsing  steeping the tea bag When you wash just Blot with a clean cloth dont reuse until washed  water only until healed better The Emergency Room taught me that because I became allergic to soap  all ointments when I had any infections etc It helps alot yes you can definitely get out breaks on your mouth but only if you already have one while preforming oral sex as long as neither of you have an out break at the time oral sex and anything else your into is fine its the outbreaks that cause the damage so when you have an outbreak mouth or otherwise just abstain from oral sex until the sores are gone thats my opinion my dad has herpes and thats how he explained it to me yes some people carry the virus and dont even know until the first outbreak but when the outbreak occurs youll know for sure its nothing like a cold sore i get cold sores BTW they are not herpes technically but my father has herpes and his sores are painful big blisters not just on the mouth but genitals too if you do have the virus it will usually show during great times of stress thats how my dads works anyways you can get herpes and never know it until an out break so either she noticed signs of an out breakmaybe blood work too that would be my best guess I have been using viraduxau for over a year and have not had a single outbreak I also had vaginal ulcers but they went away after I tried this product wwwviraduxcom There is alo tons of research and helpful videos at the site Hope this helps ok there are those of you who will say this is a scam and I had my doubts too but this is the oly treatment that has worked for me It is an antiherpetic crme called viraduxau I have been using it for over a year with no outbreaks I think it is what got my situation under control I had horrible vaginal ulcers that would heal and come back every two weeks Hope this helps someone  Taking the amino acid lysine during a breakout has been statistically proven to reduce outbreak period Taking 3g a day will help in this effort and is cost efficient Also see a doctor for additional medical advice That wasnt helpful maybe it will be helpful if in a month you wake up with a blister the size of your left nut and a dick more deformed than a jigsaw puzzle Wake up Peter Pan there are plenty of fish in the sea I wouldnt ask the general public for an opinion on this matter but there are two paths 1 Stay with her in aspiration you become married in which then you would be susceptible to herpes and have the risk your child may become infected 2 Leave and play life a couple more rounds In MY personal opinion it seems pretty obvious for the second option but it is your choice Your not running a risk with AIDS from bjs but I would recommend getting to know the guys history a little because herpes are for life There are edible condoms if you are skeptical of these issues as well  have fun and be safe No you cannot get genital herpes from fixing someone else make up The worse itch a person can experience comes from Herpes pls assure you have not any bleeding mouth ulcer other wise there is a chance of catching HIV You may speak with a dermatologist about that particular concern of yours Dr Eric Schweiger is a member of the American Academy of Dermatology and the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery He may help you with that If you have any symptoms like a sore on your genitals  If you have any symptoms like a sore on your genitals you may undergo laboratory tests to make sure if you have herpes or not  The first attack is the worst and starts between 2 and 12 days after you caught the infection usually about 4 days Later attacks recurrences are less severe Some people never get recurrences some people get them occasionally and a few people get them regularly The severity of the attacks varies a lot between individuals At one end of the spectrum some people have really troublesome attacks At the other end of the spectrum the attack may be so mild that the person does not notice any symptoms which is how people end up carrying the herpes virus unknowingly For Herpes dating with herpes singles wwwhromancecom cold sore I am also trying to find the answer as to how much risk if any there is to sharing a washer and dryer with other people when you have genital herpes I am having difficulty finding out if it can be transferred to someone else by means other than sex like a toilet seat for instance All Ive been able to find out is that it is a sexually transmitted disease period  If u r broke out at the time of birth u can pass it to the baby u could have a csection if u r broke outu should get on acyclovir twice a dayits herpes medsthere is also a natural herpes meds called llysine and take two a dayu can take both eventhe chemical and natural together even yes as lng as your partner is not having a out break u should be fine no testing was done u possible can there is no fluid therar are kind of white it happens to me about 6 months ago it is painfull i am male 47 married Unfortunately you may very well have genital herpes The medication your ex is taking is most likely an antiviral medication such as Valtrex or its generic version This medicaion only surpresses the outbreaks and makes an outbreak shorter in duration It does not cure herpes or stop it from spreading to another person A person who has herpes can spread it to another even when they do not have any current blisters or visual signs of an outbreak I would recommend getting a blood test That way you know for sure Also remember that each persons body reacts differently to the virus Some people get outbreaks often and they can be painful and itchy Others get an outbreak only once every few years and they are mild It all depends on your body Good Luck Get the factsand I am sure there are plenty of them here on WebMD To be honest Im sure youve already had sex with someone who had genital herpes before you just didnt know it This virus is much more common then you think That said think of how hard it must have been for your girl to tell youshe could have stayed silent She likes you enough to tell you the truth so if you do break up with her make sure you do it with respect Also always use a condom and dont have sex when she has an outbreak  A person gets HIV when an infected persons body fluids blood semen fluids from the vagina or breast milk enter his or her bloodstream The virus can enter the blood through linings in the mouth anus or sex organs the penis and vagina or through broken skinIn other words ALWAYS use a condom Yes Unfortunatley once you have the virus you have it forever until someone finds a cure Continue to use protection No it did not get rid of your herpes They are for life until someone finds a cure You doctor just needs to see you before giving you more medication because you havent seen him in awhile a least you havent seen the prescribing doctor in a while Will you please see a gynecologist clusters of pimples with fulid Im not a pro but I have done a lot of research myself It is possible for herpes to be in your body but remain dormant for quite some time However 16 years is a while and I have no idea if its possible but it would not surprise me If you believe you may have contracted it be sure to get tested They are able to see if you have had the disease for quite some time or recently acquired it Hope this helps To my knowledge there are 5 types of herpestype viruses Herpes type 1 is cold sores Type 2 is sexually transmitted as in genital Type 3 I believe is chicken pox Type 4 is herpes zoster which is shingles Not sure but I dont believe any of these would cause joint pains The only one I dont know about is type 5 CMV Cytomeglovirus Not sure about the spelling but thats close enough for you to do a google searchor a webMD search Hope this helps yes they can httppmahoneybuythistodayinfo i think if u got genital herpes thats about as bad as its gonna get Shingles is worse Get a Shingles shot every year  they have one at most pharmacies Also check your immunological system herpes and swelling are not synonimous Herpes is more like a rash swelling  in my case when it occurs  goes away with topical dermatological cream like for example  Mupicorin ointment Bumps and pimples ARE NOT HERPES Herpes is usually a much more severe thing Allopathic system believes that genital herpes is incurable It has been discovered that natural remedies help to prevent recurrent outbreaks by boosting immune system The first outbreak of herpes can last for several weeks The first outbreak usually is the most painful and takes the longest to heal Another outbreak can appear after weeks or months the first appeared but in most of the cases it is always less severe and shorter than the first one Surgery stress vigorous sex unbalanced diet are some of the triggers reported Herpes is a serious and recurring disease which cant be cured but just managed upto a level There are several medications available which can be used to get relief from the disease but the best way to deal with any disease is by having some natural therapies for it I have read about hypericum mysorense and nosodes which can be really very helpful for the people suffering from Herpes Hypericum family have also been studied to have antiviral effects Although people suffering first must do a research on it And consult a Doctor about the ailment Also you should avoid foods rich in arginine like peanuts chocolate and almonds which leads to more frequent herpes outbreaksAvoid alcohol and Processed Foods Take largely plantbased dietsuch as cabbage brussels sprouts kale broccoli since some individuals report success in controlling herpes outbreaks by avoiding consumption of all animal based food products No Cure you can just manage HerpesAlthough some of the natural therapies like hypericum mysorense and nosodes can be very helpful for a person People suffering from the disease should do a research about and should try some medicines having them as ingredients Also avoiding foods rich in arginine like peanuts chocolate and almonds will help as they lead to more frequent herpes outbreaksAvoid alcohol and Processed Foods Take largely plantbased diet such as cabbage brussels sprouts kale broccoli since some individuals report success in controlling herpes outbreaks by avoiding consumption of all animal based food products Natural remedies include Hypercium Mysorense and Nosodes Using medicines having these as ingredients can help a patient to a great extent However before using one must do research on it It is known that there is no cure for Herpes Herpes can only be managed to an extent Have you heard of Monolaurin It is a compound derived from coconuts and it essentially dissolves the viral DNARNA envelope allowing better access to your immune cells I used monolaurin in combination with Hypericum A combination of some pretty Potent antiviral herbs to One Two punch the virusMonolaurin  Opens up the SHeath Hypericum  Goes in and destroys the DNA Theres not a lot but some research if you Google scholar them Hope it helps Cheers Allopathic system believes that genital herpes is incurable It has been discovered that natural remedies help to prevent recurrent outbreaks by boosting immune system Herbs such as Hypericum Mysorense is traditionally believed to have antiviral properties I have almost the same thing except i have splotches that are raised and itch all over me but seems to start at the arm I read another place online a similar person had the same thing and their Dr said that it was a new virus strain your partner can only become affected when the affected person has an outbreak if you have herpes and your partner doesnt you should use protection also your partner should get tested what does genetal herpes look like  yes yes always take your medication that the doctor percribes for you and your partner should be checked to make sure that he is not infected The best thing for partner is not to have intercourse If you havent shown signs of a cold sore with in 48 hours you should be fine I say a sore is a sore How do you KNOW nothing is leaking With any type of friction say during sex it could tear open again I say better safe than sorry Just my opinion no it wont but I will tell you this if you dont have the uti treated it can shut down your kidneys and you can end up in the hospital for quite a while so if I was you I would get it taken care asap The swollen lymph nodes could be connected to the herpes infection I have herpes and Ive gotten swollen lymph nodes in my pelvis linked to it As for HIV probably not but it depends on how long after the last incidence of unprotected sex vaginalanal did you get your negative HIV test If you received a negative HIV test at least 12 weeks after your last sexual contact then you are definitely HIV negative no matter how swollen your lymph nodes If it is less than that time especially less than 6 weeks then you will need to get tested again 12 weeks from your last unprotected sex encounter to confirm the negative result As for cancer that you would need to go to a doctor to determine but you should be checking yourself for lumps in other places genitals breasts etc sorry this question "}
