gloves eye protection and use a breathing respirator Due to skin irritation affects on breathing and eye disturbances fiberglass insulation is banned in some localities Fiberglass insulation is typically made in part from recycled materials and stones These almost microscopic particles can lodge under the skin and cause irritation I believe myself that that microscopic tiny cuts in the skin

gel such as Nivea or Aveeno oatmeal Always shave with a nice sharp fresh blade If your skin is peeling it is dry and irritated you may actually have a skin allergy I would suggest you definitely see a dermatologist to set up a proper skincare regime In the meantime avoid any scrubs with glycolic or salicylic acids as these will dry you further When all else fails for dryness and flaking good oldfashioned Vaseline may help  RetinA or tretinoin is very effective in reducing fine lines and wrinkles as well as evening out pigment and shrinking pores Its really the only FDA approved antiwrinkle antiaging cream that has years of scientific proof that it works It takes several months to see the effects and should be used under the supervision of a boardcertified dermatologist It can cause dryness peeling and redness and should be used along with a moisturizer I usually recommend Cetaphil or Olio Lusso facial oil to mitigate the dryness One should also apply it VERY sparingly at night and of course always wear sunblock during the day It shouldnt be used with glycolic acid or other peeling agents Be patient see your dermatologist and you will see results Skin is the largest organ in the body so its certainly worth taking care of Not having an adequate diet contributes to your skins appearance in multiple ways If we look at the skins ability to protect itself from ultraviolet light there are key nutrients involved in that Its important to have vitamins A and C and D These actually play a role in protecting skin from ultraviolet light Malar rash itself is a manifestation of lupus and can fluctuate in severity or activity It does not necessarily but might correlate with other signs of lupus depending on the individual case The malar rash and other skin manifestations are often treated with Plaquenil Ive had something similar in my mouth on the inside top of both my cheeks Ive always just figued they were extra flaps of skin as Im able to move them around with my tongue Ive had them for as long as I can remember and have never had any problems My wife felt a large lump in one of her breasts She went to the doctor and he examined her Since he felt several areas in ech breast that was questionable and since she has 34F breasts he took about 10 minutes examining each breast He had her get an ultrasound and a mammogram A number of cysts were found and she was put on a number of OTC meds The problem went away after 6 months Yes in my case it certainly does cause sensitive skinthere are places on me that hurt when touched The thing about clear skin is that its really not about how clean or dirty your face is There is a bacteria that can live at the very base of your hair follicle which is your pore that can create what we see as acne And no matter how much you wash you will not wash that away I have also seen people use rubbing alcohol on their skin and that has no effect on the type of bacteria that causes acne and will only dry out and irritate your skin So what you really need to do is to use products that will focus on the underlying problem and not over wash because if you over wash your face what you can do is actually dry out your skin create irritation and inflammation that can look like acne or skin that is breaking out But if you just stop that your skin would clear up even more Its really important to use a proper moisturizer I have patients who come in with very dry skin and I ask them what they are using and they are using lotions The thing about lotions is that they are water based and if your skin is very dry and you are in a dry environment As that water evaporates off your skin it will also pull water out with it So even though you are making this great effort to moisturize by using the wrong product you could actually be making the problem worse So I like ingredients like shea butter that can really hydrate the skin and lock water in Some people use ointments and ointments are great at holding water in but ointments by nature dont have any water in them at all So they wont add any water So this is what you should do take a bath or a shower not more than 1015 minutes And the water should not be too hot because that will also pull the natural oils out of your skin as well so lukewarm water 1015 minutes at the most will hydrate your skin very well so you will have water in the skin When you step out of the bath or shower just pat your skin dry so its still damp and then leave in the bathroom a jar of a moisturizing cream or an ointment at that point would be good as well but those can feel too greasy for some people but there are some great creams out there When you put it on to the damp skin it will hold water into the skin and actually help pull water into the skin There are ingredients like lactic acid and hyaluronic acid that are called humectants and humectants help pull water into the skin from the environment as well You also lose more water from your skin at night so its important to moisturize before you go to bed Rosacea is a very interesting condition We sometimes also call it adult acne but its really two different things So the thing about rosacea is that you do have some control There are environmental stimuli that can trigger rosacea So its important to know what can turn it on and then we can figure out how to turn it off as well Triggers for rosacea tend to be extremes in temperature So if you go from a very hot environment to a very cold environment or vice versa that can be an extreme trigger for rosacea Probably the biggest trigger for rosacea is alcohol and it can be any type of alcohol but some people notice it more with red wine Also stress can be a very big trigger for rosacea So you have to manage your stress Obviously we cant live without stress because life would be no fun at all but you have to be able to moderate your stress so that you can handle it better and so it wont show in your skin Once you have that under control as much as possible then you can look for products that are fragrance free and dye free because anything that irritates your skin can also bring out rosacea So that will be a great starting point If that alone doesnt help then you might have to go to prescription type products that can help I like retinoids for treatment of rosacea but you have to do it very gently Topical metronidazole in a prescription form can also be very helpful and saltbased medicines can be very helpful One other trigger for rosacea can be spicy foods Then some people have their own personal triggers Some people will say chocolate is a trigger or vinegar or some vegetables So you have to sort of know your own personal triggers as well and try to avoid them Well we have come a very very long way in technology for cleansing the skin and for taking care of our skin So I have a feeling that if your grandmother used the products available today her skin would look even more young and more beautiful than it did in your eyes We love our grandmas so they always look beautiful to us But the newer cleansers are able to get the makeup off our skin without removing our natural oils and sometimes they can even add moisturizers into our skin before we even rinse off So using the newer products will help your skin look younger and better and will help the products you put on afterwards penetrate more evenly which will be good for your skin as well This is typically a problem called Keratosis Pilaris This is a genetic problem that we see in people It can just happen Sometimes you grow into it sometimes you grow out of it But also I tend to see it in people who have either personal or family histories of asthma or allergies Its not something that we can cure but we can help control it Using products like urea or lactic acid or exfoliants this can help smooth the skin and make it softer So scratching and picking at it obviously will make it worse and will make it more red will make it likely to last longer Scrubs can help to some effect Retinoids have not been very effective for this but using products that are called keratolytics something that will help the skin cells turn over more effectively can help it dramatically For some people its worse in the summer for some its worse in the winter You can sort of pick your season If you are out in the summer and you have a short sleeve dress its more important to try to treat it then and in the winter you can let it go if it doesnt bother you But its not a harmful condition its more of a nuisance Its important to start with skin that is smooth and exfoliated So the first thing you should do is take a shower and exfoliate really well especially over thicker skin area such as the elbows knees and ankles Once you have done that you can even moisturize to have your skin well hydrated A lot of the newer selftanners come with moisturizers in them already When you apply the selftanner you can apply it in smooth strokes and skip the elbows knees and ankles until the very end and then just brush it on there You can even take a towel and wipe it off there because areas that are thicker will absorb more of the product The newer products also come with ingredients that make them less likely to streak and with fragrance that make them less likely to have that awful smell that the older products did I also recommend using one thats a shade lighter because they come in several different tones Use one thats a shade lighter than the one you think you might start with So if you think you would want a medium start with a light and put it on in layers over a few hours over the course of the day in order to get to the color that you want and then you can just reapply it once a day to maintain that color Dark circles are a problem for everybody and sleep is a critical factor thats a really good point However there are other things that people also do to make dark circles and discoloration around the eyes I have noticed that people who have allergies who tend to rub their eyes a lot will also have dark circles So you have to be aware of how much you are touching your eye Otherwise its really a matter of managing your stress getting enough sleep and drinking enough water because dehydration will also cause that change there Theres two different components that can cause discoloration around the eye One is pigment Thats what gives your skin color The other is blood supply So when you have a change in either or both of those two you see that change around the eye The skin around the eye is very thin so you notice it there before you see it on other parts of the face or body and thats just a very sensitive area The only thing you can really do is get a good concealer Hope your kids grow up fast and learn to sleep through the night or maybe close the door tighter As long as your kids are safe and you know they are okay I think that a little bit of discussion with your children about their sleep patterns if they are old enough might also help but you really have to get enough sleep There is just no other way around it Well the single first most important thing you should do is have them evaluated to make sure that they are just age spots and nothing else that the dermatologist might need to biopsy or tell you that needs to be removed for medical reasons Once you establish that they are simply I dont really like to call them age spots but sunspots because if you never went in the sun chances are they would never come up then what you can do is try to conceal them They are really tough to conceal You might put a skin tone or slight yellowish color first let that set and then put your own natural foundation on top and that will help conceal it Also there are some makeups that come with light diffusers that help distract the light away from the spot and that can help as well But they can be difficult to conceal You need to wear sunscreen on any part of the skin that is exposed to the sun Oftentimes it can be the fragrance or preservative thats really causing the reaction So if you tend to be sensitive look for ones that are fragrancefree and dyefree Thats a good place to start Also apply it a few minutes like 1015 minutes before you go out in the sun to try to help protect and make sure you reapply it often enough You can do skin testing to see if you truly are allergic to the ingredients I have found that most people are allergic to an ingredient other than the active ingredient in sunscreen Those can be avoided in the future so they can still get great sun protection If you really are allergic to the sunscreen ingredient you need to look for sun protective clothing There is clothing that has ultraviolet protection built into it that lasts through multiple washings and you can find these on lots of stores or even online and look for ones that have an ultraviolet protection factor of 30 or higher A regular tshirt only has an SPF or UPF of about 3 or 8 depending if its wet or dry So dry has sun protection of about 8 and wet goes down to about 3 So you really need to look for clothing thats sun protected Wear a hat with at least a 1inch brim thats going to cover over your face effectively and try to stay in the shade as much as possible So its really sunsmart behavior put altogether that will protect your skin I get this question in my office everyday and its such a difficult thing Because I feel like we are fighting a big battle as dermatologists between people who say you need sun for Vitamin D and us as dermatologists saying to protect your skin from the sun because of all the harmful effects of sun that we now know without a doubt are the problems So Vitamin D is also available in supplements and typically you can take Vitamin D3 at 10002000 international units per day to get all the Vitamin D you need which would be exactly the same as what your skin would make from exposure to the sun So you really dont need sun exposure Depending on where you live and what your skin color is you might not be able to get enough sun exposure over enough time to keep your Vitamin D levels up anyway So if you think you have a Vitamin D deficiency ask your doctor to do a blood test to check your Vitamin D levels If you are low you can take a supplement that will get your levels back up to a range that is normal and effective for you So thats the way you should get your Vitamin D never from the sun as your main source Also you dont have to go out in the sun or to a tanning salon to get that Vitamin D just walking around is enough sun over time Sunscreens dont block 100 of the suns rays so you are getting some Vitamin D from the sun and your skin just from going out and about but count on a supplement more than the sun To brighten your skin first you have to understand what made it darker to begin with Typically thats something called inflammation That inflammation can be from something that irritated your skin like a product you used that your skin didnt like and that caused a reaction that made it red and then the red can heal towards brown before it fades away or from a pimple or acne or rosacea or it can be from sun exposure where your skin makes a tan Even people with skin of color can still make a tan and what that often looks like is skin thats more blotchy or uneven If you are taking an oral contraceptive pill and go in the sun that can cause a blotchy uneven skin tone called melasma So we use brightening creams to help lighten this The gold standard brightening cream is a product or an ingredient called Hydroquinone and this I prefer to be given by the dermatologist because we like to have control over the concentration of the product thats used and how long its used for Hydroquinones can also be combined with overthecounter ingredients that work really well like sepiwhite liquorice extract or mulberry root extract and that combined with antioxidants like Niacinamide And green tea or grape tea extracts or grape seed extracts or things like caffeine can also have an added benefit to your skin in helping even out the skin tone without bleaching your skin Thats the word I dont like using These are brighteners and not bleaches There is a condition called Polymorphous Light Eruption Its a long name we just call it PMLE What happens is that usually when you have short burst of exposure after not being in the sun for a while you notice this rash with the sun and it can be very itchy and uncomfortable This is a sensitivity to the sun As you have continued exposure generally it wears off and then the next time you go on vacation or the next spring is when you will start to see it again Its important to take antihistamines which you can get from your dermatologist or physician or overthecounter Sometimes topical cortisones help calm it down but really avoidance of sun as much as possible is the best way to treat it Its really important to moisturize effectively Sometimes just a little bit of dry skin can make your skin itchy and once you start that itchscratch cycle it can be relentless and very painful I have seen people scratch till they bleed sometimes Then when that heals it heals with discoloration and that can last a very long time especially when its below the knee which is the slowest part of the body to heal So the first and most important thing you do is to hydrate the skin This is done first in the bath or shower so a 1015 minute bath or shower You can use an oatmeal powder in the bath if you like or a gentle cleanser Then as soon as you step out just pat your skin dry so its still damp and then use a very hydrating moisturizer By this I mean a cream or an ointment not a lotion not an oil because those are too waterbased too light and will actually help you lose more water from the skin So you need something more rich and emollient On top of that you can put on a white cotton sock or even a plastic lining obviously not too tight you dont want to suffocate your leg but something thats going to help lock that moisture and water into the skin So you can put a plastic wrap on top And then put a sock over it to help really lock that moisture in and that also keeps your hands away from scratching at it You can become allergic to the ink at any time or any medicine that you are taking also You can become allergic to it even though you have been on it for a very long time So if you are having a reaction one thing is that it could be an allergic reaction but it could also just be something that is occurring in the area of the tattoo that has something to do with the tattoo but because there is pigment there you cant really see the skin clearly So I would say that this is one time that even though you dont have insurance it is worth seeing a dermatologist to have the area evaluated to make sure that the skin is otherwise healthy Oftentimes with a simple cream they can knock out that allergic reaction if thats what it is or the hypersensitivity reaction another way of calling it or do a biopsy to see if there is anything else going on in that area that might be more serious that might need to be treated It depends on how recently you had the piercing done So if its within the first week or so chances are the skin might grow back together although you will still have a scar at the site If its longer than that chances are you will always have at least a potential space there However if there is an infection it does need to be evaluated by a doctor and treated and the piercing may need to be removed until the infection has cleared at least There was actually a very interesting study that showed that after chemotherapy the hair and the skin looked better So it seems that while your skin and hair go through that regeneration process after chemotherapy the skin and hair that comes back is rejuvenated healthier hair and skin So this study showed that people did look so much better and they felt better afterwards So once you get through the chemo try to be as healthy as possible in terms of having continuity So try to have as healthy a diet as possible sleep when you can and try to get a consistent amount of sleep every night Try to manage as much as you can in terms of your stressors Meditation helps All those things that imply wellness from the inside will show through and will help you heal faster and look better once you are past the chemo Laser hair removal is truly the gold standard for removing hair on any part of the body I think it really works the best on the legs meaning that you need the fewest treatment for the longest lasting results These are called permanent However what permanent means in terms of laser hair removal means that at the end of two years you will have less hair but not no hair So some of the hairs will never come back or they will take so long to come back that it wont be in our lifetime Some of the hairs will come back sooner but will be finer and softer and when you shave they will stay gone for longer Typically it takes about six to eight treatments in order to get to that point Those treatments are done at onemonth intervals Before you have the treatment done you should shave the area so the hair is really short Waxing would remove the hair and so that wouldnt work at all So you cant wax but you can shave right before the treatment is done and then at one month you will come back and do it again and the hair will be gone for a very long time sometime forever One thing about treating the skin is that it is an ongoing process So its environmental damage and sun exposure that cause these brown spots to begin with and so once we treat them if you go back and get that damage again chances are you will have new spots created Some spots that are going to come up over time just from previous exposures will still come through even if you never get sun exposure again So having the IPL treatment did benefit you because now your skin looks more clear and it is more healthy and younger skin but you have to protect and preserve that skin in order to maintain the results It doesnt mean you need to sit at home in a darkroom in order to maintain that result but you have to be sun smart Try to wear a hat when you can use an SPF of 15 or higher even if its a cloudy day dont be fooled by a day that doesnt feel so hot or sunny Reapply that sunscreen on a regular basis and stay in the shade when you can and that will do the best for you in order to minimize those spots from returning Also using overthecounter products that contain ingredients like niacinamide and retinoids can help the skin cells turn over They contain antioxidants that help keep the skin renewed and refreshed and those can help keep those spots away as well Also ingredients like sepiwhite can be very helpful in keeping your skin more even in tone Dermal fillers are used more and more often around the eyes with really great results When you see a dark circle under the eye it can be from two different things It can be from pigments or blood supply and those are the two main things When you also see a discoloration it could be because there is a shadow effect from the skin being sunken in that area or depressed or lower than the surrounding skin So by adding a dermal filler and putting the skin on a more even plane that alone takes away the shadow and makes the skin looks smoother You can also use brightening creams that contain ingredients like niacinamide sepiwhite mulberry root extract or hydroquinones that can even out the skin tone and when you add ingredients in like caffeine and the niacinamide as I just mentioned that also can help with the redness and altogether that will help that area look as good as possible You also have to add in getting enough sleep drinking enough water having a balanced diet managing your stress and if you have allergies you need to keep your allergies under control One thing you shouldnt do is have an injection around the eyes if you have active or uncontrolled allergies because that can make that area more puffy and can make the outcome less than optimal Apply a richer and creamier moisturizer Make sure to look for one that also as an SPF of at least 30 since the UV rays are more intense at higher altitudes Also look for sunscreen that is broad spectrum and has UVAUVB protection Look for products that contain retinol and salicylic acid Toners that are alcoholfree and that contain salicylic acid are also great to keep around and reapply during the day as needed Men need skin care regimens too They should cleanse morning and night ideally with a foaming face wash Men should also use sunscreen every day all year round and exfoliate weekly Look for products that are fragrance and dyefree and designed for baby skin The words natural and organic may imply that they are more gentle or safer but there are no standards for these in skin care and these products end up being more expensive without necessarily being superior The Tzone of the face is typically more oily than the rest of the face Fortunately it is easy to avoid moisturizing these areas when you moisturize the rest of the face You can also apply toner or products with salicylic acid to the Tzone without applying it to the cheeks or the dry areas of the face The body tends to be very dry especially the lower legs so its important to use a cream rather than lotion in this area There are many excellent products that are available from the drugstore The single most important thing you do to help your skin age successfully is to use adequate sun protection Also if you smoke quit As for products there are excellent choices available at the drugstore Look for ingredients such as retinol niacinamide peptides vitamin C and hyaluronic acids Look for foods that are high in omega3 fatty acids such as almonds and salmon Olive oil is also excellent for the skin There are studies that show that Mediterranean diets and diets high in citrus fruits help keep the skin looking younger and also help against skin cancer I would also recommend avoiding foods that are highly processed and high in refined sugar  these are proinflammatory for the skin and accelerate the aging process Avoid excess alcohol which is dehydrating to the skin If you have doubts see your dermatologist Dont pick at pimples This only makes them worse increases the risk of scarring and makes the pimple more likely to recur in that spot Dont apply rubbing alcohol to the skin  it has no effect on the bacteriaoils that cause acne and only dries out the skin without making the acne better Dont think that just because its not hot or sunny you dont need sunscreen You need to apply a broadspectrum sunscreen every day all year round even if youre not at the beach and even if its cloudy Apply a broadspectrum SPF of 15 or higher I am a big fan of drugstore products The single most important way to keep your skin looking its best over time is to use sun protection every day all year round and to protect against excess sun exposure In products look for ingredients such as retinoids retinol retinyl palmitate retinyl propionate and others peptides vitamin C niacinamide caffeine grape seed extract marine extract and other antioxidants Look for undereye creams that contain retinoids niacinamide peptides and caffeine The next step is to see your dermatologist for an evaluation for a fractional CO2 procedure which can tighten and smooth the skin very nicely Be careful to also manage your salt intake get enough sleep and try not to rub the area around your eyes If you have allergiessinusitis be sure to keep them under control as much as possible since that can also contribute to the puffiness in this area The undereye area is also one place where stress shows very quickly so managing your stressors is helpful as well Look for powder or gel sunscreens Make sure to wash off every night with a foaming cleanser to avoid buildup of the product Start by using sun protection every day all yearround and reapplying every two hours if you are outdoors This will allow your skin to repair itself as much as possible I would also start with an overthecounter regimen of moisturizers retinoids and antioxidants The next level of treatment would be to see your dermatologist about inoffice evaluation first to make sure that your skin is otherwise healthy  no skin cancer or precancer  and to review possible treatments such as chemical peels or laser peels My favorite treatment for the right candidate is an inoffice fractional CO2 peel This has about one week of downtime where your skin is red and you really need to be home After that you can typically wear makeup and go back to your normal routine The result is smoother younger healthier skin that with proper care will continue to look great for years There are several factors that cause the face to age Genetics account for 2030 and the rest is environmental factors  sun smoking stress diet and other lifestyle factors There are many procedures that can help rejuvenate the skin The best approach is a combination of Botox soft tissue fillers and laser as appropriate It is important to use appropriate topical productstreatments to even out the skin tone Botox helps soften and even eliminate certain wrinkles and can even lift the brows Soft tissue fillers add volume in a very natural way when done correctly and are so important in the rejuvenation process These treatments are typically done over several visits and the results can last for years There is no collagen product that when applied to the skin will penetrate and remain as intact collagen The molecule is simply too large However topical collagen can be a really good moisturizer There are ingredients such as peptides and other antioxidants that can help stimulate collagen production The effect wont be the same as having a soft tissue filler such as collagen or hyaluronic acid injected into the skin but they can help soften fine lines and wrinkles The gold standard best product for brightening the skin is hydroquinone Other ingredients such as glutathione sepiwhite nacetyl glucosamine licorice root extract mulberry root extract and azeleic acid can also be helpful There is no collagen pill that has been shown in proper studies to grow collagen I do recommend a multivitamin daily omega3 and vitamin D supplements always under the guidance of your physician Undereye circles are due to a combination of factors  genetics allergies rubbing stress lack of sleep dehydration leftover makeup Look for products that contain peptides sepiwhite caffeine niacinamide mulberry root extract or retinoids Chin firming creams should contain retinoids peptides hyaluronic acid growth factors Speak with your dermatologist or plastic surgeon to see if a radio frequency procedure such as Thermage is appropriate for you The results in the chin area can be dramatic Look for products that contain shea butter This is very hydrating to the skin and is great for older dry skin As we age our skin barrier can become more delicate If not properly moisturized our skin can enter into a dry skin cycle To avoid this and to best care for and moisturize older skin it is recommended to use products that contain ingredients such as glycerin and niacinamide which can help to hydrate skin renew the outer layers of skin replenish the Natural Moisturizing Factors and help to repair the moisture barrier Any age really It is helpful to use an antioxidant under your sunscreen and again at night to help prevent wrinkles The most important antiaging cream you can use is sunscreen every day all yearround even if it is cloudy Damage from sun exposure is cumulative It is so much easier to prevent wrinkles than it is to fix them afterwards In a sixmonth clinical study a new threeproduct skin care regimen containing a deep wrinkle treatment with retinyl propionate was professionally tested and clinically proven to be as effective as the leading antiaging prescription brand indicated for reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles 002 tretinoin in an emollient base Others studies have shown that retinyl propionate may be less irritating to skin than the prescription retinoic acid retinaldehyde and retinol It could provide a good alternative for women who cannot tolerate these retinoids Cuttingedge genomics research shows that as we age and particularly if we are exposed to sun our natural moisture barrier becomes more fragile and difficult to repair At the same time skins natural renewal cycle starts to slow down Moisturizers containing niacinamide have been clinically proven to strengthen skins moisture barrier holding in natural moisture and to decrease the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles in as quickly as four weeks You can use products developed for use on the face Look for ingredients such as retinoids retinol retinyl propionate and others peptides vitamin C niacinamide caffeine grape seed extract marine extract and other antioxidants You can try using drugstore products that contain ingredients like niacinamide peptides hyaluronic acid and hexamidine that provide skin firming If you would like additional firming benefits you could procedures such as Thermage or aluma which use radiofrequency energy for tissue tightening Wear sunscreen of at least SPF 15 daily as UV exposure causes age spots Products with ingredients like retinol retinyl propionate niacinamide sepiwhite and nacetyl glucosamine have been clinically proven to reduce the appearance of age spots There are also excellent inoffice chemical peels and laser treatments that your dermatologist can provide to dramatically improve the appearance of sun spots The only prescription product available for wrinkles is renova Retin A and Tazorac also work well and are stronger than renova but they are FDA approved for the treatment of acne The prescription product that works for wrinkles and age spots is Triluma It contains tretinoin 4 hydroquinone and a gentle cortisone to minimize irritation There are other prescription hydroquinone products available for age spots as well Sunscreen every day all year round along with proper sun protection I also really like retinoids for those who tolerate them Other ingredients are niacinamide vitamin C and other antioxidants The first thing to do is to have a skin cancer screening to make sure that the spots are OK Your dermatologist can then recommend a variety of treatment options depending on the location number and size of the spots If you are describing the patchy darkness that occurs on the forehead cheeks and upper lip from hormones and sun  that is usually a form of melasma and for that typically we recommend products that contain hydroquinone retinoids sepiwhite as ingredients to look for Other treatments include chemical peels that more dramatically help even out the skin tone and lighten and sometimes even erase the dark spots If you go in the sun the dark patches will quickly return If the rash is on the same side of the back as on the chest and is only in that one area it could be an early sign of shingles medically known as varicella zoster virus This is a reactivation of chickenpox It occurs in the distribution of one given sensory nerve can be painful and is often followed by a blistering rash in the same location It should be treated as early as possible in order to avoid longerterm pain after the rash resolves I would recommend an immediate visit to your dermatologist for an evaluation I would not recommend applying kerosene to the skin I would recommend you see your dermatologist to evaluate the extent of the irritation and determine the right treatment plan for you Products that contain menthol are cooling to the skin and can distract from the itch You can also leave your regular moisturizer in the refrigerator and applying it when it is cool can also be soothing Otherwise it is important to get to the underlying cause I am amazed at how often it is simply due to dry skin even if it is only a little dry and that just by proper moisturizing on a regular basis the problem resolves You should look for a cream rather than a lotion and apply it right after the bath or shower Also avoid excessively hot showers and keep the showerbath to no more than 1015 minutes If that does not help its time for a checkup with your internist and dermatologist for further evaluation There are more and more treatments available for rosacea We often use antibiotics by mouth to help get it under control and then topical both metronidazole and sulfabased topical preparations as well as topical azeleic acid There are also inoffice laser and intense pulsed light treatments that can be very helpful in making your skin smoother and to help control the rosacea It is also important to try to minimize exposure to the triggers of rosacea The primary triggers are alcohol extremes in temperature and spicy foods Each person may also have their own individual triggers that may cause a flare of the condition Any rash in pregnancy should be evaluated by your dermatologist It could be as simple as eczema or a type of easytotreat yeast infection called tinea versicolor which can happen in anyone However during this sensitive time it is wise to have a medical evaluation to definitively identify the underlying cause This could be a blocked gland called a milia cyst  these are very deep and you should not try to extract them yourself It could also be a wart or a skin tag which is a benign growth of skin that is usually genetically related Common things being common it is one of these however certain types of skin cancer especially basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma can also occur in this area and for this reason the lesion should be evaluated by your dermatologist since early treatment often leads to a very small scar and complete clearance of the skin cancer It could be from sun exposure fragrance or any underlying even subtle irritation that causes inflammation of the skin can leave behind discoloration also known as hyperpigmentation There is also a type of yeast infection called tinea versicolor that can leave your neck back and upper arms looking blotchy Your dermatologist will be able to help clarify and offer you the proper treatment to clear the condition It could be psoriasis or a condition called seborrheic dermatitis Both are chronic conditions but have different underlying causes and somewhat different treatments You can start by using a salicylic acidbased wash and OTC hydrocortisone and a salicylic acid or tarbased shampoo If it does not improve your dermatologist will be able to evaluate and offer prescription treatments to better control the condition This can be a form of ichthyosis which is genetic Your dermatologist can prescribe topical prescriptionstrength moisturizers to help control the condition and make his skin smoother less dry and more comfortable Be sure to use a sunscreen No matter what your skin tone a widescale global consensus exists among experts that daily yearround broad spectrum photoprotection of at least SPF 15 is a key part of a sunsafe strategy to decrease cumulative lifetime exposure to solar UV Also niacinamide has been proven to be effective at improving skin tone as have ingredients such as retinoids mulberry root extract and sepiwhite It is also important to keep your skin hydrated to avoid dry skin and irritation from dry skin Proper exfoliation on the face and the body is important too Start by using sun protection every day all year round and reapplying every two hours if you are outdoors This will allow your skin to repair itself as much as possible I would also start with an overthecounter regimen of moisturizers retinoids and antioxidants Products that contain hydroquinone have been known to brighten the skin Niacinamide is also effective for reducing age spots Other ingredients such as glutathione sepiwhite nacetyl glucosamine licorice root extract mulberry root extract and azeleic acid can also be helpful Loss of firmness is a common concern in aging skin Skin experts have long known that the loss of skins firmness is a naturally occurring part of the aging process fueled in part by changes in the deeper layers of skin caused by decreases in functional hyaluronic acid skins natural plumper and accumulated damage to collagen and elastin the elastic fibrous protein in skins connective tissue Combined these changes lead to the loss of skins firmness and an aged appearance Products that contain ingredients such as niacinimide caffeine glycerine and hyaluronic acid can be effective in firming skin With the proper skin care you will see observed the benefits Thermage can be highly effective in the right candidate This is a procedure done by your dermatologist that uses radiofrequency energy for tissue tightening and can be used both on the face and other areas of the body Some people are more prone to poor wound healing or keloids which are raised firm scars that can often be itchy and may even be disfiguring Keloids are more common in AfricanAmericans but can occur in all skin types If you are prone to keloids you should let your doctor know and think very carefully before having any body piercings or elective surgery Photofacial treatments use intense pulsed light to help even out skin tone and reduce redness This can be very effective but should be done by or under the close supervision of your dermatologist Multiple treatments are usually necessary for best results There can be some redness for a few hours to a day or so after the treatment Radiofrequency treatments such as Thermage can help tighten the skin in this area to some extent Your dermatologist will be able to evaluate and determine if this is the right treatment for you Permanent eyeliner can be very natural and highly effective in creating a natural contour and outline for the eyes with very low risk of allergy or change to eyelid tissue Be sure to be evaluated and treated by a boardcertified permanent makeup artist for the safest treatment and best results Be sure to use a sunscreen No matter

qualified trained aesthetic physician dermatologistplastic surgeon Both the dark spots and the light spots are due to cumulative sun exposure over years What you do now may help prevent the spots from getting darker and will make it so you get fewer new ones over time but they are really markers of what happened 1020 years ago There are excellent sun protection products that are oil free or are designed for oily skin and I would recommend looking for those in particular if your skin is oily The first thing to do is to have a skin cancer screening to make sure that the spots are OK Your

appear to help the infection but it actually suppresses the bodys ability to fight the infection and will make it worse Even lowstrength topical steroids can make a yeast infection or any infection worse In fact topical steroid use can make yeast infections more likely The best way to prevent dry and itchy skin use natural products for skin such as  Argan oil neem oil aloe vera etc and healthy lifestyle are the choices that can help to delay the natural aging process It will Also reduce the redness natural products for skin Simply go through Natural treatment Natural treatment or organic treatment is one of the best solution to cure Spider Bit Baking Powder and some components include vitamin C and Salicylicacid are consider the best home remedies for treatment  are now widely available from dedicated internetonly retailers who have more recently been joined online by established outlets including the major department stores and traditional bricks and mortar beauty retailers Although modern makeup has been traditionally used mainly by women an increasing number of males are gradually using cosmetics usually associated to women to enhance or cover their own facial features Concealer is commonly used by cosmeticconscious men Cosmetics brands release cosmetic products especially tailored for men and men are increasingly using such products Cosmetics colloquially known as makeup or makeup are care substances used to enhance the appearance or odor of the human body They are generally mixtures of chemical compounds some being derived from natural sources many being syntheticCosmetic companies successfully resist regulation by government agencies like the FDA and have also lobbied against this regulation throughout the years The FDA does not have to approve or review cosmetics or what goes in them before they are sold to the consumers The FDA only regulates against the colors that can be used in the cosmetics and hair dyes The cosmetic companies do not have to report any injuries from the products they also only have voluntary recalls of products Sorry youre going through this Some people are prone to developing  and its not a pleasant process to go through If you are not running a fever you can probably take a waitandsee attitude toward the situation A fever is indicative of an infection though a localized skin infection may not cause much of a fever Drainage is good when it comes to cysts so you can try applying very warm compresses to the area to help draw out the remaining fluid The white head youre seeing could be a layer of skin cells regrowing to cover the opening Although you can gently scrub the skin to keep the cyst open we generally discourage people from doing this because you dont want to inadvertently introduce infection to the area Speaking of which you also can apply antibacterial ointment to the area to reduce the chances of the wound becoming infected Its not unusual for a large sebaceous cyst to take several days to completely drain after it has burst on its own Assuming youre not allergic to any overthecounter pain remedies you can take ibuprofen or acetaminophen for the pain If you continue to have concerns about the cyst or if it emits a smelly greenish pus or if you start running a fever then its time for a trip to the doctor Its not necessarily an emergency but Id recommend you call your primary health care provider if the situation gets worse or doesnt clear up over the next several days Wishing you well The short answer is this Yes you should see a doctor You could have a cyst a lipoma or something else Your best bet is to have this examined by an appropriate health care provider such as a dermatologist though you can simply go see your primary care provider if necessary Unfortunately we cant diagnose a skin lesion like this via the internet And if its an infected cyst or something youll need to have it drained because it wont clear up on its own Best to you I would suggest you get this looked at by a health care provider Id recommend starting with your primary health care provider as opposed to a dermatologist The symptoms you describe could be caused by an allergic reaction as you suspected but they could also signal something else such as infected hair follicles cysts or other disorders If theres an infection involved youll need to get it treated or it wont clear up Thats why I suggest you consult your primary health care provider first Youre right to be concerned about this though I wouldnt panic by any means If possible take some photos of the rash or outbreak in case you cant get an appointment while youre experiencing the problem Take care Well the obvious answer is Stop doing situps But seriously it sounds like you may be overdoing the situps or performing them incorrectly Doing situps should not cause the skin to rub off your tailbone Traditional situps arent really a recommended form of exercise anymore as they may cause lower back issues are the preferred exercise and they shouldnt rub your tailbone raw because your skin shouldnt be moving in the tailbone area At the very least take care to perform your situps on some type of padding And dont do any situps until your wounds heal Skin wounds can become infected fairly easily and you want to avoid that You may want to visit to discuss your exercise regimen with other people and experts They might be able to help you figure out why youre having this annoying problem with situps Hope this helps Its possible you have a fungal infection commonly called   This can occur when you dont completely dry the groin area after exercising and showering The skin of the groin area is home to many beneficial bacteria However when this area remains damp it can allow other bacteria to flourish This can result in a fungal infection Assuming you dont have any lesions sores pimples  that sort of thing its probably safe for you to try an overthecounter spray powder or cream for jock itch Youll find these products near the medications for athletes foot To prevent jock itch be sure to towel dry as much as possible then apply a powder or cornstarch to help keep the area dry If youre unsure about whether you actually have jock itch or if the overthecounter treatment doesnt help the problem by all means visit your health care provider to determine what is going on Hope this helps If you disrupted the skin by trying to squeeze a presumed mole out of the tissue there really is no way to make it go back in I suggest you keep an eye on this to make sure you dont now develop a skin infection If you experience localized redness heat swelling or pain or if you develop a fever you should seek medical attention For future reference its not a good idea to try to remove skin lesions yourself Never pop pimples dig out lesions with a knife or squeeze growths on the skin For one thing you dont necessarily know for sure what they are For example what you think is a mole could be a skin cancer Pulling it out of the skin could appear to remove the lesion but cancerous cells not visible to the naked eye could remain behind and delay your getting treatment Hope this helps While its extremely rare to be allergic to Synthroid generic name levothyroxine that doesnt mean its impossible Synthroid is a brand name It contains certain binders and dyes that could conceivably cause an allergic reaction even though this medication has been used safely by millions of people Rest assured if it turns out you are allergic to something in Synthroid there are plenty of other options for you Generic versions of levothyroxine abound Your health care provider certainly can let you try different preparations to see which one works for you without causing an allergic reaction However its also possible something else entirely is causing your problems You should see your health care provider as soon as possible to try to determine what is causing your symptoms I hope you feel better soon The key phrase in your question is this I was playing video games at the time Since the numbness is confined to the tip of your thumb chances are youre suffering from a repetitive motion injury Any activity that involves the same movement of the hands and fingers over and over again can cause irritation of the nerves that supply them In the extreme this can cause loss of movement and severe pain In your case it sounds like you may have irritated a nerve that carries sensory impulses to the brain That tiny nerve ending apparently has stopped working The good news is if this is indeed a repetitve motion injury you can improve the situation by resting your hand for awhile Avoid playing any video games and see if the situation improves If not see your health care provider for further evaluation Just to be clear the in men generally include a crushing or squeezing sensation in the middle of the chest chest pain pain or numbness radiating down the left arm andor into the left jaw shortness of breath faintness or nausea And dont think just because youre only 19 years old that a heart attack would be out of the question While its unlikely a heart attack can strike people of almost any age particularly if theyre sedentary andor overweight The short answer is no Or at least it would be highly unlikely An exam uses sound waves to create a picture of organs and other structures within the body The sound waves do not contain any heat During an ultrasound test a technician uses a handpiece called a wand along with some cold gel to bounce the soundwaves off your insides and collect the data that returns This information is produced as a picture on a screen The ultrasound gel is made up mainly of water so that should not produce a skin burn either The wand does not give off any heat so it also should not produce a burn If you experienced a skin burn after receiving an ultrasound examination that would be very unusual indeed You should report that to your doctor If you have not yet had an ultrasound test then I hope this answer sets your mind at ease Ultrasound tests are very safe Best wishes to you Dehydration probably wont cause this symptom but many other conditions can Usually the cause of the hands andor feet and legs turning blue isnt serious  unless there are other symptoms involved such as shortness of breath or a fever Depending on a persons skin color the extremities sometimes can look quite blue This is true of very fairskinned people Id suggest your daughter get checked out for this There are a few disorders that can cause this blueness of the extremities Sometimes these disorders actually point to other conditions that can be treated or should be watched as your daughter ages I wish you both all the best From what youre describing these two events dont seem to be related If the skin cracking youre now experiencing occurs at a different place on the finger from where the cut was then the cut has nothing to do with whats going on right now Cracking of the skin around the nail area is not an uncommon problem especially in the winter when the air dries out due to artificial heating using the furnace or when the hands are placed in water for long periods of time If you work in a job that requires you to place your hands in water  particularly any water that contains chemicals such as dishwashing soap disinfectants that sort of thing  you should be provided with rubber gloves to protect your hands You also would be well advised to wear rubber gloves at home whenever you work with water to help prevent this skin cracking youre experiencing Its impossible to say whats causing this exactly If your health care provider prescribed steroid cream it makes me wonder if he or she diagnosed this as a  But Im not going to speculate here Since the situation is bothering you Id suggest making another appointment with your primary care provider or whoever prescribed the steroid cream to discuss the situation and the diagnosis Your PCP will be able to tell you how to manage this situation All the best to you Im sorry to hear youre going through this Your symptoms definitely deserve to be checked out by your health care provider Any time a person develops a symptom like widespread loss of sensation to a body area its a good idea to get examined You can start with your primary care provider or whoever treated your UTIs Because your UTI cleared up over a month ago I wouldnt think your symptom is some weird side effect of antibiotics And I dont think antiperspirant use would cause loss of sensation either though if youre spraying it directly on your groin area you could try stopping that to see if sensation improves At any rate Id recommend you make an appointment with your health care provider for an exam Best wishes to you In case you didnt know it isnt caused by a worm at all Ringworm is actually a skin fungus just like athletes foot or jock itch You can get ringworm in a variety of ways from sharing a towel with someone whos infected to touching damp surfaces that carry the fungus The fungus that causes ringworm thrives in warm damp environments which is why its frequently acquired in places like public pool common areas To your question You could catch ringworm from your friend even if you didnt touch the lesion The reason is because the fungus could be infecting other areas of your friends skin but not showing the characteristic ring mark yet If you have thoroughly washed and DRIED the skin areas that came in contact with your friend youre probably not going to get ringworm However be careful not to share any sports gear or towels with your friend and be sure to wear flipflops or other foot protection if you all are bathing in a common shower area or something like that By the way ringworm will not clear up on its own It needs to be treated with an antifungal preparation Your friend can try using an overthecounter cream for athletes foot the generic name is miconazole but if that doesnt help or if the ringworm starts spreading your friend should seek medical attention In rare instances ringworm is best treated with a prescription medication Hope this helps The answer is Yes and no Some of your symptoms could be indicative of dehydation namely Dark colored urine Extreme thirst Itchy skin Hard stools Confusion But dehydration is not the only condition that could cause these symptoms I hope youre following up with a medical professional about these symptoms to determine the underlying cause Regarding your hemoglobin results I wonder if youre referring to the actual hemoglobin test or if youre referring to the  hemoglobin A1C  test These are two entirely different things Basically a hemoglobin test measures your red blood cell count A result of 68 would be quite low for either a woman or a man In fact that result would put you in the  anemic  category and it would require medical treatment On the other hand a hemoglobin A1C test provides a snapshot of your blood sugar control over the preceding three months A result of 68 would be considered within the desirable range for someone with diabetes It would be considered outside the normal range for someone without diagnosed diabetes I would suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider PCP to review your symptoms get a diagnosis and come up with a treatment plan Best to you Thanks for providing all the great background information If several different doctors have told you the blemish is a cyst then thats probably accurate A is a pocket of tissue thats filled with some type of fluid The type of fluid can vary depending on the type of cyst Some are filled with fatty acids while others contain pus It sounds like your cyst is located within the skin layer not in the breast tissue which is good news Skin cysts are very common and do tend to drain occasionally as youve described The fact the cyst has gotten bigger and changed color is a good reason to have a health care provider reevaluate this Its possible the cyst needs to be treated by having it drained or even removed Only your health care provider can say for sure Cysts are an annoyance but luckily theyre not a serious disease Good luck to you as you cope with this Its hard to say what this lump is so its good youre going to the doctor In the meantime I think I can set your mind at ease that this lump is not a medical emergency and probably isnt anything lifethreatening Many conditions can cause the type of lump you describe My best guess is youll discover this bump is a  which does indeed contain scar tissue These bumps often present as a hard lump under the skin that is discolored and sometimes tender to touch At any rate your health care provider will be able to diagnose this for you and recommend appropriate treatment Wishing you all the best Sometimes the use of skin lightening products over the long term can actually cause hyperpigmentation darkening of the skin The product youre using contains hydroquinone which has been known to cause skin darkening instead of the expected lightening At this point your best bet is to avoid using any skin lightening product until you can see a dermatologist or plastic surgeon He or she can advise you about how to reverse the skin darkening youve experienced So sorry youre going through this I hope you get some answers soon Im sorry to hear youre going through this Dry flaky skin can be more than a nuisance If the skin develops microscopic cracks it can let infections pass through If you have flaky skin all over your body as you stated then one cause could be dehydration As we age we tend to decrease our fluid intake Id suggest you make sure to drink several glasses of plain water each day If you are being treated for high blood pressure or a heart condition you might want to check with your health care provider about how much fluid intake is best for you But generally speaking drinking a few glasses of water per day is safe If you bathe daily Id suggest you cut back on that Were hyperhygienic here in the US Unless youre strenuously exercising you probably dont need a full bath or shower each day and that much bathing can dry out your skin Instead try a daily sponge bath with warm soapy water to clean your armpits groinrectum and under your breasts Rinse and dry thoroughly Your use of lotion is a great idea Keep that up Use a bland moisturizer meaning something with little perfume You can get specific recommendations from a pharmacist or clerk at the local drugstore Thicker is better so look for something that comes in a jar Try not to scratch because this can lead to tears in the skin that allow bacteria in I know its hard maybe impossible not to scratch when your skins that dry But try to avoid it I hope you feel better soon Well thats kind of weird isnt it Im sorry youre going through this The shoulder and arm area is an odd place to get a rash or a breakout of something like  If the rash is happening only on one side its probably worth having a health care provider look at it though its probably not any sort of emergency If the rash is occurring on both shouldersarms then you might consider causes such as laundry detergent mild allergy or reaction dryer sheets wearing new clothes before washing them a change in the type of soap you use again possibly a mild allergic reaction or something along those lines If the rashblotchiness doesnt clear up on its own or if it gets worse spreads or your begin having swelling of the facemouth andor shortness of breath then you need to seek medical care Best wishes as you try to solve this mystery Id say if this has been going on for several days that you should seek medical attention You may not necessarily need to rush to the emergency room but you should at least call your primary care provider Several conditions can cause the symptoms youre describing including  an which is not cancer so dont get alarmed or  Its impossible to say whats going on without getting a physical exam If you begin to exhibit any of the following symptoms then you should go to the emergency room Fever over 101F Vomiting Yellowing of eyes or skin Pain getting much worse instead of better Difficulty breathingshortness of breath I hope you feel better soon Sorry youre experiencing this Its obviously having a negative effect on your life and thats a good enough reason to see a medical provider for an evaluation A number of conditions can cause what we generally call   even though in your case you dont seem to be actually perspiring These can range in women from hyperthyroidism to hormone issues A physical exam coupled with some lab work may be able to pinpoint the problem for you and get you on a path to treatment Id suggest you put a call in to your primary health care provider for an appointment The sooner you see a doctor the sooner youll be able to get this situation resolved Wishing you all the best Whenever a person hits an extremity hard enough to break the skin we become concerned about a possible  Your friend probably would be welladvised to head for an urgent care facility for an Xray especially given the level of bruising you describe Meanwhile your roommate can elevate her foot apply a compression bandage like an Ace wrap for moderate compression dont wrap it too tightly and apply ice packs to the foot These steps  the socalled RICE approach for Rest Ice Compress Elevate  may help reduce swelling which hinders the bodys healing response I hope your roommate feels better soon Im sorry youre dealing with all of this It sounds miserable While nothings impossible its highly doubtful the steroid treatment caused the symptoms that developed in January Even though youve been thoroughly checked out if the symptoms persist you should consider continuing to follow up on them Many disease processes develop slowly over time This means an initial workup all those tests you had done wont always reveal an answer If you get tested later something may show up I want to add also that I wouldnt jump to a conclusion of cancer or precancer Nothing in your description would lead me to think cancer Id just recommend following up again with your health care provider until the problem gets resolved Take care Aside from the skin issue which Ill get to in a moment youre probably not drinking enough water Most adults should aim for 8 glasses a day though thats just a number someone picked out of thin air Clearly if youre just taking a few sips of water with your meds youre probably not getting enough water Now about that skin If youre talking about that flabby skin on the backbottom of your upper arms Im afraid I dont have good news Many women develop that loose skin and theres nothing you can do short of to get rid of it Even exercising the triceps muscles wont reduce this excessive skin Many women are prone to developing that excess skin by middle age It may be caused by having gained and lost weight over the years And who among us women hasnt gained and lost weight from time to time over our lives So Im sorry I cant tell you the flabby arms are due to dehydration That said I suggest you drink more water Its good for your overall wellbeing Wishing you all the best The good news is this bump is on the skin Usually lumps on the skin arent serious in other words not like a breast cancer which usually resides deeper in the tissue Several things could cause a bump like you describe It could be a  for example If so the good news is it can be drained treated and probably wont return Other than that I wouldnt want to speculate Youve done the right thing by scheduling a medical appointment Try not to feel too anxious Soon youll know exactly what this thing is and then you can move forward with a treatment plan Feel better soon Im sorry to hear youve been going through this Nobody likes being ill Many different conditions could cause what youre describing One likely candidate is  Certain types of food poisoning can cause bloody stool These types often are accompanied by a high fever over 101F You should seek medical attention if your symptoms havent cleared up within a few days If this is indeed food poisoning it probably will go away on its own Meanwhile you need to be sure to drink plenty of fluids to avoid becoming dehydrated Assuming youre otherwise healthy I often recommend halfstrength Gatorade or a few glasses of water alternating with one glass of Gatorade to help you stay hydrated and maintain electrolyte balance One thing you dont want to do is take an overthecounter antidiarrhea preparation If this does turn out to be food poisoning diarrhea is your bodys way of getting rid of the toxin So if things dont clear up within a few days see a health care professional before you think about treating yourself Feel better soon Well this is an interesting question Im not sure theres a straightforward answer because Im not sure anyone has studied this Heres what we know Smoking around infants and children can cause them to inhale secondhand smoke which may be linked to higher rates of certain lung problems like asthma We also know secondhand smoke contains harmful chemicals and that this smoke containing chemicals can settle on surfaces such as clothing draperies countertops and so on Will coming in contact with this potentially toxic material on someones shirt or fingertips cause problems for your baby My guess and its strictly a guess is probably not If this were the case the entire Baby Boomer generation would probably exhibit symptoms because nearly all of our relatives smoked and held babies at the same time You can reduce any possible risk by gently wiping off your baby with a damp cloth after he or she has been cuddled by someone you believe has tobacco smoke residue on their clothing or hands You probably dont need to be overly aggressive about this Dont scrub the little ones skin off But a simple swipe should do the trick Hope this helps The best advice I can give you is to go back to your piercer They have specialized tools to help remove these piercings safely Its not likely the piercing has become ingrown Its much more likely the darn thing is just stuck However if there is a problem with the piercing your piercer should be able to recommend a course of action If you get infections around the piercing Id suggest you see your primary health care provider These infections can turn serious and its lucky yours have all cleared up Hope this helps Im sorry to hear youre going through this Sometimes pregnancy can stretch the abdominal muscles out so much that they cant snap back Theyre kind of like elastic that way  and Im sure youve seen how floppy an elastic waistband gets after its been overstretched Id suggest you visit your doctor to find out if he or she thinks this is the problem in your case If so he or she may be able to tell you whether or not abdominal muscle exercises will help If all else fails you can have this corrected with a cosmetic surgery procedure called abdominoplasty or   In this surgery the abdominal muscles are literally sewed back together to give your belly a tight look again However this surgery is not recommended for any woman who plans to have more children Save it for the time when youre confident your family is complete Probably not the news you wanted to hear but I wanted to be honest with you Wishing you all the best Great question is generally considered safe but people should understand there are now several different flavors of liposuction These include traditional tumescent liposuction noninvasive cryoliposuction cool lipo and laser liposuction The answer to your question depends a bit on what type of liposuction you had done If you had traditional tumescent liposuction in which fluid was injected under your skin before the fat being sucked out with a metal wand called a cannula then pinkness around the cannula sites may not be unusual If the pink spots are near the incision sites this also may simply be normal bruising With traditional liposuction there is always some level of bruising to the treated areas afterwards Because you have questions about these pink patches Id suggest you call the surgeon who performed your liposuction procedure to find out whats going on He or she is in the best position to tell you if youre experiencing normal healing or if something else is going on Wishing you all the best Im sorry youre going through this and that its concerning you The skin is an amazing organ One thing it does is function as sort of a radiator for the body in the sense that blood vessels in the skins surface become enlarged to release heat when the core of the body gets too warm This engorgement of the blood vessels in the skin can cause flushing a red appearance and may make the skin feel hot The body releases excess heat this way in order to avoid overheating the core I guess my question would be why is your body getting so hot at midday Is it because youre exercising for example Are you going through menopause and experiencing hot flashes Or do you just get unbearably hot at the same time every day Our body temperature tends to fluctuate throughout the day but if youre getting uncomfortably hot every day at the same time with no known cause it would be worth discussing this with your doctor at your next visit I mean it sounds as if your body is functioning normally your core gets hot so your skin releases the heat but perhaps theres some underlying cause for this that should be checked out I wish you all the best with this I guess the safest advice to give you is to call your surgeons office for some guidance On the one hand the bruiselike mark on your lower abdomen doesnt surprise me after a  But the warmness in your legs sounds a bit unusual In a laparoscopy procedure three small incisions are made in the abdomen One of these cuts is in the belly button Because gravity will pull old blood such as in a bruise toward the feet that mark you see on your belly could simply be bruising related to the belly button incision Why your legs would feel warm is a mystery to me When you speak to your surgeon or his or her nurse be prepared to tell him or her when the symptoms started This will help them assess if the leg issue is related to the surgery or not Wishing you all the best Hi As a former plastic surgery nurse I feel uniquely qualified to answer your question  Its not uncommon for a woman especially one like yourself who considers herself a natural type person to feel uncomfortable physically and psychologically with her enhanced breasts in the time period immediately following the surgery In my experience this discomfort goes away pretty quickly as you get used to the new breasts When I was a plastic surgery nurse the surgeon I worked for always advised women to wait at least 3 months before making a decision about the size or removal of implants At the threemonth mark virtually all of the swelling has gone away and youve had time to adjust to your new look I can tell you in my experience none of our clients who felt as you do opted to have their implants removed once they got used to them I hope this helps ease your mind Youre still recovering so be kind to yourself and give both your body and your emotions time to cope with this surgery Best wishes to you Well my best suggestion is to seek medical attention Under most circumstances its not a good idea to pop any lump or bump that comes up under the skin particularly if it doesnt have a visible head Its especially not a good idea to use a thumbtack to pop skin lumps Lancing boils and other skin lesions is better left to professionals Wihle youre waiting for an appointment with your primary care provider keep the hole clean by washing with plain soap and rinsing with water If youre not allergic to any medications you also can put an antibiotic ointment such as Neosporin or generic triple antibiotic ointment on the hole to help guard against infection If you develop a fever hot red swelling at the puncture site pain that gets worse instead of better or feeling like youre coming down with the flu you should go to an urgent care facility as these can be signs of an infection I wish you the best of luck with this Im sorry youre dealing with this Skin rashes can be painful and annoying Unfortunately its impossible to diagnose what this might be without performing a physical examination From what youre describing this sounds like some type of  I doubt its warts because they usually are not painful or scaly Fortunately many types of dermatitis can be treated with a prescription cream that will heal up the scaly patch of skin Once it heals up the pain should go away Id recommend you make an appointment with your primary care provider or a dermatologist the next time this flares up That way youll get an accurate diagnosis Best wishes to you Im sorry to hear your brotherinlaw and family are going through this especially during the holiday season Youre right that is rare And thats problematic in terms of predicting prognosis because study results for this disease often are based on small populations or even individual patients According to  the 5year survival rate for patients with earlystage localized disease negative lymph nodes is about 90 Thats not an entirely reliable number due to various statistical factors but it gives you something to go on In general with most cancers the less advanced it is the higher the success rate for chemotherapy and other treatments This may give you additional insight into how advanced his disease is I caution you though that this type of information can be hard for a lay person to interpret If you have any questions about it feel free to print this chart out and take it to the doctor with you to have it explained by a medical professional I wish you and your family all the best with this I dont know what these bumps are but I suggest you see a medical professional for a diagnosis In general its a bad idea to squeeze or pop skin bumps or lesions because when you do this you create a hole in the skin that infectious bacteria can enter through This can lead to an infection loss of skin scarring etc Lumps on the scalp arent exactly uncommon Its possible these are cysts or lipomas Only a health care provider can say for sure All the best to you Im neither a guy nor a urologist but one thing I feel pretty confident saying is this circumcised or not masturbation shouldnt hurt or sting uncomfortably Of course the penis always swells when its aroused The swelling causes the penis to stay erect for penetration during sexual intercourse If thats the type of swelling youre talking about then its perfectly normal If youre implying you experience an abnormal swelling other than a normal erection then thats worth investigating I suggest you see a urologist to explain whats going on and find out if what youre experiencing is normal or is something that needs to be addressed Do not feel embarrassed consulting a urologist They deal with questions like yours every day and will respond in a respectful and dignified way You have a legitimate concern after all Take care As a plastic and reconstructive surgery nurse I worked with many women who had large breasts that caused rashes or neck pain Heres what I can tell you The type of procedure youre looking for is breast reduction not augmentation will reduce the overall size of your breasts as well as perking them up so they sit in a more natural position Many insurance companies will cover breast reduction under certain conditions For example serious neck pain that doesnt respond to any other treatment like physical therapy and can be attributed to large breasts may be covered With rashes insurance companies seem in my experience less likely to cover breast reduction unless the rashes recur frequently and have not responded to other treatments You need to have documentation that youve seen your primary care provider multiple times and have tried prescription creams or whatever without clearing up the rashes for more than short periods of time Also with rashes your insurance may be less likely to cover the procedure if youre obese because in theory reducing the size of your abdomen might help the rash problem If youve tried without success to medically treat the rashes Id suggest you schedule an appointment with a plastic and reconstructive surgeon to discuss your options He or she wont be able to tell you if your insurance will cover a breast reduction but the surgeon can give you an opinion on whether you might benefit from breast reduction and can submit the claim for prior authorization After that its up to the individual insurer You need to know that breast reduction can impair your ability to nurse a baby Its doubtful youd be completely unable to nurse but removing breast tissue does reduce the number of milk ducts which can reduce the volume of milk your baby is able to get from nursing Hope this helps I guess my main concern here is that youre not following up with your medical provider Who ordered the blood work Did they tell you to come back for a followup appointment If not you need to schedule an appointment anyway because youre symptomatic Your health care provider is the only person in a position to give you a diagnosis and help interpret the lab results so I suggest you go back to see him or her as soon as possible I hope you feel better soon I suggest you get this checked out by a medical professional Many conditions can cause the symptoms you describe but one that comes to mind is a  Obviously if thats the case you want to get treatment as soon as possible Itching is not normally a sign of Staph infection but it still would be good to rule this out At any rate youre having abnormal symptoms that are worth getting checked Meanwhile be sure to wash your hands thoroughly and often In the event you have some sort of communicable infection you want to take every precaution not to transmit it to someone else I wish you all the best Bumps in the genital area can be caused by many sources including as you already know the herpes virus Another potential cause is human papilloma virus HPV which often looks like warts Skin tags and small fatty tumors also can cause bumps in the genital area However none of these types of bumps will wash away with soap and water Youd be welladvised to see a physician about this as soon as possible If for instance the bumps you saw are caused by HPV it means you can transmit the virus to your sexual partners In any case youll sleep better at night finding out exactly what is causing these bumps Dont be embarrassed to discuss this issue with your health care provider You can start with your primary care provider He or she will be able to direct you to a specialist if needed I think over using these creams must have caused the irritation I would suggest you to use natural products for your skin as they have no side effects on

not feeling feverish would be about 968 F almost 2 degree Fahrenheit lesser than normal When I am feeling feverish the temperature would rise to about 97ish rarely reaching 98 No doctor would agree that i have fever since it doesnt show up on thermometer However strangely my skin is very hot to touch and even normal person could feel that but interior body temperature is not I would feel feverish with chills I would have episodes of feverish feeling every 2 months or so and every time it would last for a 23 weeks Doctor would prescribe some antibiotics and do some tests but they were not helpful I do not have Thyroid or any other deficiency however I have been recently diagnosed with Celiac disease as well The reason I write this time is because something miraculous happened this and I would want others opinion if it helps relieve your symptoms as well This might very well be a cure Treatment Day1 Take 500mg Paracetamol After 30 mins take Vitamin C  Zinc supplement Day2 Continue Vitamin C Zinc daily for next few days I got fantastic relief on day 2 onwards and no longer feel hot and my temperature is back to 969ish J Waiting for your inputs and wishing a speedy recovery The only reason to cut it off is if it is infected otherwise there is no reason to reopen the wound Signs of infection are redness swelling very sore  foul odor Signs of healing is continuous itching  some tenderness Sometimes this is the way the body releases toxins that have build up Most vaccines is a small dose of the live virus The way it works is it allows your body to build its own antibodies so you may get symptoms when given the vaccine to fight off the virus now  in the future usually it will allow you to fight the illness while keeping you from getting the symptoms no If you are not having proper diet then your weight loss might be making your skin itchy However it I very important to lose weight in healthy way so look on your diet because your skin needs a lot of other

httpwwwdermnetnzorgdermatitishanddermatitishtml Hand dermatitis often results from a combination of causes including genetic makeup constitutional factors injury contact with irritants and allergy It is frequently caused or aggravated by work when it is known as occupational dermatitis Hand dermatitis is particularly common in industries involving cleaning catering metalwork hairdressing healthcare and mechanical work \t \t \t\tHand dermatitis varies in severity It may affect the backs of the hands the palms or both sites Often it starts as a mild intermittent complaint but it can become increasingly severe and persistent The affected skin initially becomes red and dry then progresses to itchy papules bumps and fluidfilled blisters vesicles scaling cracking fissures weeping exudation and swelling oedema Bacterial infection can result in pustules crusting and pain Longstanding dermatitis at the ends of the fingers may result in deformed nails Hand dermatitis can spread to affect other sites particularly the forearms and feet \t Focal pattern vitiligo and segmental vitiligo remain localized to one part of the body and do not spread There is no way to predict if generalized vitiligo will spread For some people the depigmented patches do not spread The disorder is usually progressive however and over time the white patches will spread to other areas of the body For some people vitiligo spreads slowly over many years For other people spreading occurs rapidly Some people have reported additional depigmentation following periods of physical or emotional stress If you are talking about your daughter she may be beginning puberty Most girls begin puberty between ages 8 and 13 The breast having small lumps that are tender are sometimes the first signs of puberty Sometimes one breast may become bigger than the other This is usually followed by a growth spurt 12 years later If the breast is red really hurts has discharge or any other symptoms speak to your doctor If you think your child is starting puberty this is a good time to talk to her about the changes that will be coming in the next few years I would be likely to think it is the antibiotics Do you usually get a rash from running a temperature I think you should contact your doctor immediately before you take any more medicine Just my opinion Yes Medications that are applied topically can be absorbed by touching skin to skin There are some medications that are so strong in effect such as cancer medications that simply touching them can cause side effects There is no list of these medications So it is important to ask your local pharmacist or check with your physician Amiodarone a cardiovascular medication does cause some people to turn irreversibly blue It is important to check with a pharmacist in order to understand this medication prior to taking it Also if you have any apprehensions you should talk to your pharmacist about the risks and benefits of any medication to make sure that you are comfortable and compliant It is possible that the type of condom and any lubricant or liquid it contains can irritate the skin Discharge can be due to dryness or change in normal flora Make a mental note of the type of condom that you are using and speak to your local pharmacist or your obgyn about other options that may be less irritating Some of your medications can cause you to be a bit sunsensitive This means that you may want to reduce the amount of sun you are exposed to and use a higher SPF reapplying it every 12 hours you spend in the sun Tanning is not a medically recommended habit If a tanned appearance is important to you look into using selftanning products There isnt a drug that will block your tan However there are plenty of medications that can accelerate or increase the risk of burning Childrens sunscreen has the right amount of ingredients to protect a childs skin It also doesnt have the perfumes and alcohols that can be found in adult products ingredients which can increase irritation to the skin and lead to rashes If you are looking to utilize one product for the whole family I recommend using a babys or a childs sunscreen product The formulation has less chemicals and will still have the correct SPF protection for everyone Oily hair is a natural production If you wash your hair frequently it causes your body to produce more oil The less you wash it the more the production slows down Ways to absorb body oil is to use baby powder Just use a small amount at the roots and pat the white color out Some hair salons have colored hair powder that can be used if you do not like the white powder As for the face or skin a light lotion that is less greasy should be applied as a moisturizer There are also face towelettes that can be used to blot the face and eliminate oil and perspiration Claritin and Zyrtec are not used to treat the itching associated with a foot rash Without seeing the foot rash it is difficult to help in selecting an overthecounter medication for treatment The most common type of foot rash is athletes foot which is caused by a fungus Symptoms include red itching burning areas and sometimes dry white flakes The burning itch associated with the foot rash is treated with antifungal medication Please note having an itch does not always mean that an allergy medication is going to alleviate your symptoms Medications are intended to work for the cause of a specific condition You need to use the appropriate medication for the actual condition Seeking medical advice informing another healthcare professional and asking a pharmacist about all the symptoms that are involved can help to correctly identify and treat your condition I have experienced this as well however it happens to me only when I am sick especially if I have a fever I assume that is not the case with you because you say you are healthy but perhaps youre coming down with an illness such as a cold or flu Im not sure how long this has been affecting you so if it is not due to a regular illness such as a coldflufever here are a few ideas to google Tactile allodynia dysesthesia and fibromyalgia Tactile allodynia in particular sounds like exactly what you are describing I hope you find answers and get relief Good luck keep it clean an covered with some neosporen on it and if its earitated something for an infection Theres no way to know for sure without going to a doctor so if you want a definitive answer that is what you need to do It does sound like you are probably experiencing a simply skin reaction very common on the penis Common skin irritations often respond to a top notch penis nutrient cream health professionals recommend Man1 Man Oil Look for a cream that includes a natural emollient like shea butter Good luck  I dont blame you for wantin to be cautious but for what its worth Ive been using it the Man1 Man Oil I mean for a few months and it does a great job for me A friend told me I should use it thats how I found out about it My doctor says I have really sensitive skin on my member and it can get real dried out and scaly and stuffm but not since I been using this Go for it I had the same problem and found a home remedy that is safe to use on your pets as well to repel ticks and fleas or any of the bloodsucking variety of insect Try not to drink caffeine coffeetea beverages This can sometimes happen once you start doing personal grooming in that area Sometimes it can happen if there is a lot of friction as well It is most likely an ingrown hair What happens is that a hair follicle gets infected from not growing properly and a pimplelike pustule forms It can be red or purple in color and can be very irritating and painful Solution It needs to be lanced or popped Its going to hurt when you do it but once its done the pain will go away Be sure to get a qtip with rubbing alcohol or hydrogen peroxide on it and apply it the area But JUST to that area It might bleed for a little bit too Just apply a little pressure on it for a few minutes and it will stop bleeding Bathe or shower as normal Just be sure to keep an eye on it Baby acne small bumps on the face head and chest is common from about 1 to 4 months If the baby is not bothered by the rash use plain water when bathing and it will soon go away Check with your doctor for the best treatment if any for your baby since there are many different kinds of rashes Mosquito bites do not cause high fever or hives Horsefly bites cause high fever and hives If you get bitten by a mosquito it just leaves a little red itchy bump Horsefly bites are more serious If you are bitten by a horsefly it leaves a huge red bump about 58 inches long And about 3 days later the bump fades away but then you start to get one itchy bump on a part of your body and if you scratch you break out in the known reaction as hives The best cure for hives is an oatmeal bath or milk of magnesia And of course rest You should try to not eat too much junk food because that can lead to diabetes and in extreme cases it can lead to obesity and death So try not to eat too much sugary foods If you want a snack try to have a piece of fruit instead of a bag of chips or drink water instead of high sugar juices and soda The reason that you are having skin burn when you sweat is because there are fats and toxins in your body that is not needed so when you workout you sweat and that is when your body gets rid of the fats that your body does not need which can cause obesity and death Your skin is burning so that it can get rid of the toxins in your body that can make you sick so be sure to take a good shower And also make sure that your hair is properly washed If it is not then the toxins in the sweat can damage your scalp and form hair dandruff Could be a sign of Endometriosis or perhaps you were pregnant and had a miscarriage It is unusual for a man of 19 not to feel sexual pleasure or to have wet dreams if indeed he has not Is it possible that he may have some anxiety issues related to sex This would be the most obvious explanation it would be a good idea for him to talk to a professional about this The foreskin is attached to the glans from birth by skin adhesions and is designed to protect the penis These adhesions disintegrate naturally over time and most boys can fully retract the foreskin by their late teens This is MOST though  there are exceptions and it doesnt mean there is anything wrong with you if you cant pull it back fully at 17 years of age This is exactly what happens in a condition recognized by Chinese medicine call Empty Heat or Empty Fire The clinical manifestations of Empty Heat in general irrespective of organ are  a feeling of heat in the afternoonevening  a dry mouth with desire to drink in small sips  malar flush red cheekbones  a dry throat at night  a feeling of heat in the chest and palms and soles also called A5palm heat  dry stools  scantydark urine  a FloatingEmpty and Rapid pulse  a red tongue without coating httpmaciociaonlineblogspotcom201206emptyheathtml Applying cold to the outside like air conditioning will only keep the internal heat inside of your body see the url above for more information Western Medicine does not yet understand this pattern of symptoms I would recommend seeing a competent Traditional Chinese Medical Doctor in your area preferably  a Traditional Chinese Medical doctor The difference can be more that 5 years of study and clinical education Consult a doctor immediately and keep the rash clean Any bug bite has the risk of becoming infected Due to your symptoms I recommend that you see your doctor It may not have been a roach that bit you People can also be allergic to roaches believe it or not wound care yes but you need to see a MD for possible antibiotic treatment It is a sign of hormonal changes Whether the changes are due to pregnancy  well only a test can answer that question for you I have excema or dermatitis like that see your doctor for a hydracortisone cream that should help So pharmacists want to have a patient that comes to me that tells me about this particular medication and saying that its not working I have to ask him a few questions I want to find out if they are applying the patch in the right way Sometimes patients dont understand that they have to apply a patch to a certain area of the body They also may not understand that one of the things that they need to do is take off the patch that they shouldnt leave the other patch on and then put on another one So I tend to ask a lot of questions about how you are using this patch I will also ask them if they are keeping a diary about how their pain has been since they started it Now my skin is going to be different than your skin So patches the drug is actually absorbed through the skin and gives the effect So if your skin might be a little more thicker than mine it might take longer for that drug to pass In this case I also want to ask the patient if he has made the physician fully aware of how he is using the patch and maybe we need to switch him to a different company Because they all make different platforms of how the drug is absorbed into the skin so he might need a different type of patch Also maybe we need to increase the strength of the patch and see how he does on that So its a step wise approach and individualized therapy The physician probably wants to try this because at some point because of the past medication he was on he may have developed a tolerance to that medication and it wasnt really treating his pain So the doctor is probably looking at other options instead to make it a little more easier for the patient Good question This really depends on what type of infection and how severe it is Typically if you have a small cut you can wash with soap and water and then apply a triple antibiotic ointment If the infection on the skin appears red warm to the touch painful or oozing you will need to see your health care provider Skin infections can be very difficult to treat and can require prescription antibiotics if not taken seriously I would monitor the rash and if it appears to be getting worse  warm to touch swollen or spreading  you will need to go to the doctor for evaluation Since you are sensitive to these types of bites have you considered applying a topical product before you go out to avoid bites There are a variety of different products on the market in various forms There are even some sunscreens that now contain repellents This caught my attention because Preparation H should only be used to help treat and relieve the symptoms of hemorrhoids You should not use overthecounter products for other areas of the body unless the packaging states so It is very important that you follow the directions on the package and use these products correctly to avoid serious harm Lidocaine patches or Lidoderm patches are used to help relieve pain associated with herpes zoster shingles This medicine is a local anesthetic It works by stopping nerves from transmitting painful impulses to the brain Make sure you follow the directions provided when you apply the patch If you have any questions talk to your pharmacist we are happy to help Quitting smoking is a great way to save money and it also is great for your health There is free service that can help folks successfully quit smoking by providing resources and tools and even free or discounted nicotine replacement products Visit

to the touch painful or oozing you will need to see your healthcare provider Skin infections can be very difficult to treat and can require prescription antibiotics if not taken seriously There are several possible conditions that can cause lesions on the penis similar to those you are describing It is important that you see a doctor for an examination to find out for sure what is causing the lesions Infection is one possibility Genital herpes can cause blisters and ulcers that are usually in a cluster Syphilis can cause a lesion that is typically described as a painless ulcer Condyloma caused by the HPV virus can cause raised lesions and plaques Molluscum contagiosum caused by a virus can cause raised lesions There are several common noninfectious conditions that can cause lesions on the penis These include lichen sclerosus lichen planus and pearly penile papules among others Age spots technically called solar lentigines are welldefined uniformly colored areas of brown or grayish pigment that generally appear on the hands face neck and chest Despite the name these spots are the result of prior sun exposure not age You can treat age spots several ways The most popular athome treatments are overthecounter OTC hydroquinone HQ preparations which inhibit melanin production in the skin But they tend to be more effective for treating melasma or hormonallyinduced irregular pigmentations than for true age spots Dermatologists often have better results with prescriptionstrength retinol and HQ creams which work faster than OTC formulations Dermatologists also use microdermabrasion chemical peels chemical spot treatments laser treatments and light therapy to lighten age spots Some of these procedures require just one treatment others take two or three sessions Remember to have a dermatologist check your age spots yearly to make sure they truly are benign And if you notice changes in color size shape or feel tell your skin care specialist right away It could be athletes foot Try some of the athletes foot ointments or sprays from your local pharmacy and see if that helps Also try to keep your footfeet dry wear socks and make sure you stay nice and clean  Making sure youre not using strong soap or detergent is important for me using a really good penis health cream has been a lifesaver I use Man1 Man Oil and it has lots of great ingredients that really do the job for me So heres the thing its not unusual for a guys tool to have different colors thats just part of being a tool But if you use a really good penis health cream like Man1 Man Oil that can help to even out skin tone even better it helps make the penis skin look good and healthy Mine looks amazing nowadays  Ive even had a girl compliment me on how good it looks  So a good health cream should be a benefit when youre working on the foreskin its not something helps the stretching itself but it should help relieve the soreness that can sometimes result until the skin gets loosened and can help protect the skin itself which is important I use Man1 Man Oil which really moisturizes my tool and makes it feel a lot better when its overused  Yep definitely try that Ive been through some of this stuff too and one of the reasons I use Man1 Man Oil is because of the vitamin E that vitamin is supposed to do wonders for skin and I also think that using that cream is a big help for my overall penis health It sure looks and feels a lot better  Yep supposed to and does Im a guy that spends a lot of time with his tool  and Id rather have my hand down my pants for fun instead of because Im constantly scratching but I used to have a penis that itched like mad I finally got around to trying Man1 Man Oil and have had no complaints since Go for it  Dude I hear you  but ya gotta use them Theyre way too important not to So here try this  use polyurethane condoms and see if that makes a difference Also m ake sure you use something like Man1 Man Oil I use it and it keeps my tool itchfree which is kinda amazing considering how my tool used to be He doesnt need to get cut if the smell is all thats worrying him Guys pack a lot of odor in their junk cut or not Im cut and it used to wreak but then I staretd using Man1 Man Oil which is this GREAT cream Its loaded up with vitamin A or something that goes to work on bacteria and helps keep the smell away Tell you bf to use it and see  Hey good for you for taking care of your tool I used to ignore mine healthwise and boy did it get all wrinkled and ugly so I know what youre talking about bro Yeah Man1 Man Oil is really good for that its got all sorts of stuff in it that helps with dry skin wrinkled skin  and this was a big one for me it also helps get rid of that nasty odor that the tool gets sometimes well mine did anyway Way definitely a good idea And use the one called Man1 Man Oil which is what I use and my dick has never been in better shape My tool is way sensitive to any changes like soap or detergent but it has given me no probs since I started using this stuff  its awesome  Glad that the infection is gone  those are nasty Ive used Man1 Man Oil on my flaky member and it works really great for me My penis used to be kind of embarrassing at least when it was in one of its flaky stages but now I dont have to worry about that which is a real relief I hear you bro Im a bigtime wanker myself why not right and I used to get a really numb knob after whacking too much Try what I did which is using Man1 Man Oil it has something in its one of those ingredients with a name you cant pronounce that helps make the tool sensitivie again Really works  Hey take it from someone who knows hes right I sweat buckets every damn day and it used to be my crotch was rank really rank Yeah Id wash every day and even tried airing my tool out whenever I could but it was still disgusting So then I started using Man1 Man Oil one reason being because Id heard about the vitamin A in it helping and yeha it does You know I dont smell like a bed of roses but that nasty odor is gone now So use it Way definitely a good idea And use the one called Man1 Man Oil which is what I use and my dick has never been in better shape My tool is way sensitive to any changes like soap or detergent but it has given me no probs since I started using this stuff  its awesome  I use it every day because I tend to get really dry cracked skin Since I started using Man1 Man Oil my skin has been smooth and moist and my whole tool looks and feels a lot better  no more pain from it being chafed  OK I can identify with your bf  I have a hard time keeping my hands off myself And yeah I get really really sore sometimes and raw skin and all but Ive been using Man1 Man Oil for a while now and it really helps me A tool that gets all that use needs to get moisturized and this stuff really does it great for me Definitely do get it  and what a cool thing for a gf to do for her guy  Ok I think were talking smegma here What your bf needs to do is get that Man1 and start using it like now Smegma happens but using Man1 is a great way to get rid of it and its not like it takes any real effort  just rubbing it in regularly So yes it can help and he should do it I dont know your age but after awhile sunspots or discoloration shows up on your skin I have them I try to stay out of the sun but still managed to get a discoloration area thats larger than a spot on my neck I try to always wear wide brimmed hat and wear sunscreen Have you been tested for fibromyalgia I have this and the pain moves to different areas If you shave your armpits it could be from that Your husband would need to be examined before a diagnosis could be made That said I found an article that has some general info about lumps and bumps that may be found on the body httpwwwwebmdcomskinproblemsandtreatmentsguidecystslumpsbumps You would need to see a doctor who can get information from you regarding your symptoms do an exam and learn about your medical history before being able to provide you a diagnosis There are many different reasons a person could have urethral discharge A visit to the doctor for an exam and testing can be done to diagnose and guide appropriate treatment Here is more information on urethritis httpwwwwebmdcomatozguidesurethritissymptomscausestreatments It is possible Any time you change medications you could experience a new side effect However not all new symptoms are caused by medications You would need to have your rash examined by a doctor in order to see if it is simply a drug side effect or if something unrelated to the medication is causing the rash If the redness and itchiness is in the same spot as where you applied the patch this is a common side effect of patches applied to the skin It is important when you use a patch to rotate the sites of application each day and to try and avoid using the same spot for at least 7 days This can help curb the local reaction caused by the patch If it happens every day wherever you apply the patch you could be allergic to one of the ingredients in the patch You can ask your pharmacist to suggest a different patch or a different method to help you quit smoking if you are allergic to the patch you are using No The reaction you described would not be considered normal If you experience a rash from a medication you should contact your doctor immediately It could be a sign of an allergic reaction to the medication or a serious side effect Medications can only be guaranteed to be at their most effective when they are used before their expiration date Once expired they may not be as effective I am not aware of any evidence that betablockers like atenolol can stunt a childs growth If you have concerns about your childs medications you should talk to his or her healthcare professional My Aunt had the exact issue during her radiation and chemo treatments for breast cancer I know she used nutragena Tea Tree oil shampoo which relieved the itching and flakiness greatly She used tea tree oil cleaners on her face also She found she used a lot of aveno baby products also I think there was an oatmeal bath soap liquid that was also helpful Unfortunately menopause is associated with dryness in many areas  the skin included Estrogen therapy does help in general but skin dryness alone is not an official indication for estrogen therapy Most dermatologists recommend lots of topical moisturizers One other thing to remember is that as it gets colder and we keep our heat on more and more the air in the house tends to get drier So adding moisture to the air in your home is a good idea  even getting a kids vaporizer for the bedroom can be helpful If moisture doesnt help do check in with your healthcare provider to rule out other skin issues like eczema Skin contains elastic fibers that allow it to stretch during weight gain or recoil or shrink during weight loss So someone who gains a large amount of weight does not grow new skin Their skin stretches to accommodate the accumulation of fat tissue  There is some evidence that a diet limited in dairy products and low in sugar and processed carbohydrates can help decrease the risk of acne breakouts That would mean not overdoing milk cheese and yogurt while maintaining a diet rich in whole foods including fruits vegetables whole grains lean meats beans and healthy fats vegetable oilsavocadonuts and seeds that is also low in sugar and processed foods So too many sugary drinks may have an adverse affect on acne But diet is only part of the story and a healthcare provider can help you figure out all the contributing factors For more on diets effect on acne see these articles httpwwwwebmdcomskinproblemsandtreatmentsacnenews20110808lowcarbdietsmayimproveacne

enough protein and nutrients is also key Exercise and toning muscles should also help  There is no research that biotin causes weight gain Weight gain is typically caused by a calorie imbalance and certain medications but not vitamins A balanced diet is more effective than supplements which is explained in this post httpwwwwebmdcomhealthybeautyhairhealth11eathairtypepage1 For more specifics on biotin uses evidence and side effects visit this page httpwwwwebmdcomvitaminssupplementsingredientmono313BIOTINaspxactiveIngredientId313activeIngredientNameBIOTIN People who lose large amounts of weight may end up having excess skin Each person is different though and its hard to predict who is more vulnerable Some people choose to have excess skin removed once they have maintained weight loss for a period of time The key is to lose weight for your health and quality of life and then you can decide what you want to do if there is extra skin Sti Lesion is a general word for a tissue abnormality Liver lesion is a term doctors use for abnormal areas noted on an imaging test of the liver Most often liver lesions are seen on an ultrasound computed tomogram CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging MRI scan The term liver lesion is a general term Liver lesions could be anything from harmless cysts in the liver to areas of cancer spreading from the colon or breast The appearance of the lesions on imaging as well as other diagnoses and test results can often help explain the cause of liver lesions When the nature of liver lesions is unclear and a diagnosis such as cancer is possible a biopsy is often needed to determine their cause Theres no good evidence to back up this commonly held belief The few studies that have tried to link the amount of caffeine consumption and height in kids did not show any connection between caffeine drinking and being short Most caffeinated drinks children drink are sodas and energy drinks filled with sugar as well as caffeine Sugary beverages dont stunt growth they enhance weight gain Probably for this reason high intake of soft drinks may be also a risk factor for developing diabetes Reserving coffee and tea for grownups may not have scientific proof behind it but theres nothing wrong with it either Sugary caffeinated drinks are best as a rare treat for adults and children My daughter had that same thing I took her in and they said it was MRSA They put her in the hospital for 7 days You should go to the doctor if its bothering you that bad My daughters was really sore to the touch If it gets any bigger you should go to the doctor  CIP also known as  is one or more rare conditions where a person cannot feel and has never felt physical pain Paitents with this dissorder can still feel touch they just can not feel pain It is a neurological problem You should get checked out by a neurologist to make sure everything is okay Some fungi live only on human skin hair or nails Others live on animals and only sometimes are found on human skin Still others live in the soil It is often difficult or impossible to identify the source of a particular persons skin fungus The fungi may spread from person to person anthropophilic from animal to person zoophilic or from the soil to a person geophilic Heat and moisture help fungi grow and thrive which makes them more commonly found in skin folds such as those in the groin or between the toes This also accounts for their reputation as being caught from showers locker rooms and swimming pools This reputation is exaggerated though since many people with jock itch or athletes foot have not contracted the infection from locker rooms or athletic facilities Physical Examination A manual examination of the breast is an important screening method for detecting cancer and is the first step in the evaluation of a breast lump Unfortunately the manual examination of the breast is not perfect However if a mass can be felt manually it is important to estimate the location of the mass so that the mammogram andor other diagnostic examinations can focus on the particular area A doctor also inspects any suspicious skin changes that may be a sign of breast cancer Since the manual examination can miss breast cancer mammography is also important as a screening tool Mammogram Women with a breast lump need to have a mammogram of both breasts A mammogram is estimated to be able to detect about 90 of breast cancers This means that about 10 of breast cancers are missed by mammography Therefore if a woman or her physician feels a lump and the mammogram is normal further studies or biopsies are carried out to rule out cancer Sometimes a certain pattern of calcium deposits appears on the mammogram that makes the doctor suspicious of cancer In these cases it is often recommended that a biopsy be taken that is guided by a mammography technician to be sure the correct area is sampled Ultrasound Ultrasound is useful in the evaluation of breast lumps It can distinguish between a cyst such as a benign cyst which is filled with fluid and a solid lump which may or may not be cancerous The first step in the evaluation of a breast lump is to determine whether it is a cyst or solid mass and this is what an ultrasound can do best Especially in young women in whom a benign cyst may be suspected if the womans ultrasound confirms a typical cyst she may not require any procedures or biopsies If it is unclear on the ultrasound whether the lump is completely a cyst a further evaluation is usually recommended MRI Magnetic resonance imaging is becoming more widely used in the evaluation of breast lumps MRI is a special radiology technique designed to image internal structures of the body using magnetism radio waves and a computer to produce the images of body structures Cancers require a greater blood supply than noncancerous growths and the images obtained from an MRI may help determine whether a particular area is cancerous because the MRI shows greater contrast in those areas with an increased blood supply In most cases MRI is performed if results of mammography and ultrasound evaluations are not conclusive MRI also has limitations For example MRI cannot detect the presence of calcium deposits which can be identified by mammography and may be a sign of cancer It is important to keep in mind that skin tags usually do not have to be treated Deciding to have no treatment is always a reasonable option if the growths are not bothersome If the tags are bothersome multiple home and medical options are available Tie off tag at narrow base with a piece of dental floss or string Freeze tag with liquid nitrogen Burn tag using electric cautery or Hyfrecator Remove tag with scissors with or without anesthetic There are several effective medical ways to remove a skin tag including removing with scissors freezing using liquid nitrogen and burning using medical electric cautery at the physicians office Usually small tags may be removed easily without anesthesia while larger growths may require some local anesthesia injected lidocaine prior to removal Application of a topical anesthesia cream Betacaine cream or LMX 5 cream prior to the procedure may be desirable in areas where there are a large number of tags Dermatologists skin specialist doctors family physicians and internal medicine physicians are the doctors who treat tags most often Occasionally an eye specialist ophthalmologist is needed to remove tags very close to the eyelid margin There are also home remedies and selftreatments including tying off the small tag stalk with a piece of thread or dental floss and allowing the tag to fall off over several days The advantage of scissor removal is that the growth is immediately removed and there are instant results The potential disadvantage of any kind of scissor or minor surgical procedure to remove tags is minor bleeding Possible risks with freezing or burning include temporary skin discoloration need for repeat treatments and failure for the tag to fall off There is no evidence that removing tags causes more tags to grow Rather there are some people who may be more prone to developing skin tags and may have new growths periodically Some patients even require periodic removal of tags at annual or quarterly intervals Get yourself checked for a UTI DVT or deep venous thrombosis is a blood clot that forms in the deep veins often in the thigh or calf Risk factors for DVT fall into two categories inherited and acquired Inherited risks include different conditions that cause the blood to clot more easily The more common of these are mutations of factor V Leiden and the prothrombin gene These may run in families Some of the acquired risks include \tRecent surgery \tObesity \tExtended travel or bed rest \tCancer \tPregnancy \tHormone therapy and birth control pills You report that you have at least two of these risk factors for blood clotsyour weight and your family history Blood clots in the leg do not always have any symptoms at all Symptoms when they occur may include any of the following \tSwelling \tPain or tendernesspossibly only while standing or walking \tWarmth in the skin \tRed or discolored skin \tLeg fatigue Because of your risk factors and symptoms you should call your doctor right away DVT is dangerous because a blood clot can travel from the leg and become lodged in the lungs This can cause serious breathing problems and even death Your doctor may recommend a blood test called a ddimer an ultrasound or an xray test called a venogram to help diagnose the problem Click here for more information on the Symptoms and Diagnosis of Deep Vein Thrombosis I am a Vitilago sufferer My patches started just before turning 40

expected as a result of diabetes There are probably multiple potential causes including both systemic internal conditions and contact related external causes A dermatologist or primary care provider would be the ones to see if this symptom is significant for you The numbness in both big toes may be related or unrelated to your skin condition Diabetic neuropathy a common complication of diabetes typically involves toe numbness in both feet Skin peeling is not part of the condition If the numbness in the toes seems clearly related to the skin peeling it is probably not diabetic neuropathy In any case a doctor would be an appropriate next step Without being able to examine the area it sounds like either a hemorrhoid or possibly an abscess  However your doctor needs to examine you to exactly determine what it is In addition to the bump a hemorrhoid is often itchy Its typically caused by constipation or having to strain more when having a bowel movement They arent typically sore but can be especially if they get inflamed However an abscess is more likely to be tender as it is a bacterial infection with a build up of pus in the area I have included a couple of links above to help you learn more about both of these conditions You need to determine exactly whats causing it by seeing your doctor in order to know how to treat it It could be one of these conditions or

can usually make the diagnosis of vitiligo during a physical exam There is no known way to prevent or cure vitiligo However several methods including cosmetics repigmentation using UV light therapy corticosteroid creams depigmentation of unaffected skin areas and skin grafting can be used to improve the appearance of skin severely affected by vitiligo Some people go through there whole life with this they even get it on there faces I dont think there was a cure but as you can read there is a chance But on your penis are you a naturist by any chance Good Luck Hi I think your find its just a

amounts Just see how you get on Good Luck Hi The first thing is it just tight or attached This next bit I coped from the NHS very British Phimosis is not usually a problem unless it is causing symptoms If symptoms are present the tight foreskin is probably the result of irritation from urine or an infection and you will need to see your GP Treating the irritation or infection will usually clear the problem If there is swelling soreness and redness around the glans and foreskin sometimes with a thick discharge under the foreskin the cause is probably balanitis Balanitis is not serious and can usually be cured with bathing A steroid cream may need to be applied and antibiotics are sometimes necessary The most common cause of balanitis in young boys is not getting rid of excess urine from the end of the penis after urinating Balanitis can sometimes be confused with a urinary tract infection which causes pain when urinating a feeling of needing to urinate urgently and blood in the urine This will need treatment with antibiotics So is this of any help Good Luck Hi OK I live in Greece and dont have skin problems but when working out in very hot sun I use just a very good organic

Lancing them can be disgusting though its my preferred method of dealing with them as well  just make sure to keep it clean Or give tit a really good old squeeze that works as well but make sure it bleeds when all the junk is out both ways With either a sea salt wash after will help Hope this helps you Good Luck Unless its for a very prolonged period of time then low likelihood Infrared lasers dont have a very high frequency so their radiation isnt dangerous theyre actually behind visible light on the electromagnetic spectrum Go see a dermatologist as soon as possible Acne scars will fade with age however you can make them fade faster with laser treatment Talk to your dermatologist about it As for the small pimpletype bumps your dermatologist could prescribe you a topical cream I would agree make the appointment to see your doctor ASAP Thats the best thing to do If you dont know what it it then I would leave it alone and consult with your dermatologist in person Depending on the severity they may fade if you are good about moisturizing and you can even use Vitamin E oil each night to help the scar fade If they do not diminish after a year or two there are laser treatments you can look into that will help significantly though they are fairly pricey and usually not covered by insurance It is probably not gout if it were gout it would be swelling in one particular area like the base of the big toe It could possibly be athletes foot but I would try to see a podiatrist or even possibly a dermatologist I wouldnt try any more home remedies that might be increasing the irritation A deep bruise on your tailbone wont show on the skin but it does hurt really badly and is uncomfortable to sit on for a while When I bruised my tailbone falling down stairs I was in pain for about a week and a half and couldnt participate in normal activities for the first two days I did see a doctor who confirmed it was just a bruise though It may have just been bruised badly but it could be safe to go to the walk in clinic for reassurance I am glad that you went to the doctor for an exam and testing From what you have described it does not sound like Herpes A primary new infection typically takes 2 to 14 days to present itself A Herpes outbreak typically lasts 13 weeks and consists of blisters which cause pain itching and burning Polycystic ovarian syndrome PCOS is a very complicated disorder in that it can cause many different problems One of the things that we worry about the most is insulin resistance similar to diabetes which needs to be treated Another is not having a regular menstrual cycle which can lead to abnormal cells developing inside the uterus Other problems include acne high cholesterol heavy hair growth in abnormal areas and infertility Sometimes PCOS will resolve with time or with weight loss but for some it is lifelong Typically it is treated with oral contraceptives to regulate your hormones and periods andor metformin to help with the insulin resistance It is very important for you to followup with your gynecologist for treatment and monitoring rip them off nitrogen gas to freeze them off find a witch doctor dehydrification or washimg with homemade lye soap instantly maybe you have scabies or the shingles virus change your diet start eating more fiber 24 grams per day sunflower seeds are great for fiber and you dont want to eat too much of one thing then you get an inconsistent stool that might also account for your nails the tooth decay is just you need to brush your teeth more often go see a dentist and get your teeth fixed and then start brushing them and keeping them clean the jaw popping could be related to the underbite youre gonna want to get braces maybe if youre losing your hair that may not be a big deal if it comes out in the brush thats normal if its like you go to wash your hair and it starts falling out like on the grudge you may wanna get checked out I know this was a year ago so Im answering it only because if someone else has similar symptoms he or she may see this Your description most closely matches that of a severe UTI probably a raging kidney infection and if you didnt go to an Emergency Department of a local hospital for immediate treatment I hate to think what would have happened to you by now I used to get them a lot in fact last time I was in the hospital they discovered I had a UTI I hope you got treatment Anyone with your symptoms should consider them a true emergency We human beings cannot live without our kidneys I need to know whether you mean blocked URETHRA the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body or blocked URETER one of the two tubes that lead each from one of the kidneys to the urinary bladder My late father once had a kidney stone that blocked one of his ureters causing hydronephrosis  his urine was backing up into the kidney It was very dangerous and his urologist had to install a stent to keep the ureter open wider until he passed the kidney stone During the time he had the stent he became temporarily incontinent and had to wear mens Depends but after it was resolved that problem went away Years later however both his kidneys failed completely Since he was dying of cancer at the time no one ever figured out why If you have a blocked ureter the kidney to which it belongs will develop hydronephrosis unless it is treated a urologist would need to tend to that and quickly If on the other hand what is blocked is not one of the ureters but your urethra that would also be an emergency possibly a much more immediately urgent one If the urethra is totally blocked the bladder cannot empty at all and will eventually burst upward through the dome Depending upon why the urethra is blocked treatment may involve passing a catheter into the bladder or even emergency surgery to remove the obstruction If the urethra is partially blocked only a small amount of urine may emerge the bladder will become overdistended and a UTI will be highly likely to develop plus the condition will be extremely painful In that case it becomes necessary to have a catheter passed into the bladder to empty it and then the condition that caused the blocked urethra treated In men this is most likely to be caused by a swollen prostate gland In women injury to the urethra and certain types of vaginal swelling are most likely though many other conditions are possible In either case  whether its your urethra or one of your ureters that is blocked  it needs medical attention The sooner the better As for the skin rash a doctor would have to look at that to see if its connected but I do know that in actual kidney failure small crystals of uric acid or urea salts actually emerge through the pores of the skin but by the time this happens the person is near death and is not likely to be using a computer The rash could still be connected in some way to the underlying condition though because it is true that either a blocked ureter or a blocked urethra result in toxins not being properly eliminated by the body The most important thing is to get medical treatment for the blockage and then tend to the rest Good Luck I have always had the same thingmine is just dry skin Wash you face with a gentle cleanser I use hydrocordizone cream and smear a good face creme on your face at night  a little more around you nose and put a face lotion on in morning I use a special sponge around my nose which you can get at a drugstore in the beauty section and before I put the creme on I use this after I wash my face to get some of the dry skin off Also try to drink more water Let me know how you make out Good luck You need to go see your gyno or family doc It could just be a nervous disorder I have seen this in kids and adults but you could check with your family doc to make sure could be bad circulationgo see your family doc It could be due to less circulation of blood and lack of enough oxygen Wearing stockings would improve the blood flow Yes we will test for TB any time we need to It is a killed part of the TB so it is safe to get during pregnancy You know that is a good question Let me start off with this The question of the medium complected person the olive skinned patient that has perhaps brown eyes what do we do for them because Ive stated that they are not the perfect candidate Well there are people who kind of fall into youre probably okay type department What we do there is rather than guess what the result would be we do what we call a patch test or a demo We take a little bit of the chemical we put it on the skin of the forehead usually under where the hair would conceal it and we test the skin kind of like paint companies test paint put it out in the sun for a few months Were going to see how that skin behaves and were going to see what the end color is Now we may have to wait 3 to 6 months It may take that long for the pink color to fade and for the skin to get to the ultimate color its going to be Most of the time itll be lighter but in some people it could be darker and wed like to know that Now its a color issue for these people Its not an issue of a greater chance of other serious complications like scarring or the white bumps its strictly the color But that is important because people would like to have uniform color and natural look But we also have to remind that patient that since most peoples skin will lighten up a little bit if they have a reasonable amount of pigment then theres a potential color difference between the treated face and the untreated neck Now that can be concealed with makeup and not necessarily heavy makeup but the patient needs to know that going in because there are some women for example who say but I dont ever wear makeup and I dont want to wear makeup and if Im going to look like Ive got a color difference then maybe this isnt for me and I agree it isnt for them But if we can show them by the patch test the sample test the demo what the outcome will be then they can make a better decision We still have to deal with the patient who has some darkness and increased darkness from sun damage and there are less intense ways to deal with Even if a patient does develop pigmentation because perhaps they went out in the sun a little too soon or perhaps they went water skiing and washed off their sunscreen we do have bleach creams that are very effective within 4 to 6 weeks when applied once a day will bleach out that pigment Really Yeah not the extent of Michael Jackson bleach but to get us back to the baseline Yes we have some wonderful products that are available today all basically from good research Yes I am a facial cosmetic surgeon and still make patients happy with eyelid and facelifts neck lifts and chemical wrinkle removal But for those on a tighter budget cosmetic surgeons and dermatologists can now give you some real bang for your nonsurgical bucks Here is my shortlist of the three best things you can do for that healthy younger and youthful look 1 RetinA RetinA a derivative of vitamin A should be thought of as a vitamin too The skins own potent and unique vitamin if you will Take one a day if you will A nighttime application of just a peasized amount of RetinA available also as the generic retinoic acid followed by application of a moisturizer another favorite and winner see below will go a long way to make your skin smoother and free of minor blemishes including some of those nasty brown spots age spots An important longterm benefit of RetinA is that it thickens the outer layer of the skin and thats important thicker skin resists wrinkling RetinA is available only by prescription It comes in various strengths Consult your dermatologist or cosmetic plastic surgeon for more information and advice on use And remember for the optimal results use it every day dont quit 2 Moisturizer  sunscreen Summers here  we need to get serious about sun protection Particularly if you live in Southern CA South Texas or South Florida In those hot spots the sun is strong and therefore not your skins best friend There are many excellent moisturizersunscreen combinations on the market And dont equate cost with excellence The pricier ones have the big ticket to pay for all the marketing and advertising What SPF sun protection factor number should you use The number scale was developed to indicate potency relative to elapsed time of use Divide the SPF number by four to get the number of hours the product is expected to be effective The only problem with such a general formula is that it does not take into account how heavy the application and what factors might cause the protection to be dissipated such as by sweating or water sports Best advice Pick a midstrength product say SPF 30 reapply every 23 hours and you cannot go wrong Remember a little sun is OK Nature intended us to get some sun to produce the essential vitamin D But benefits diminish and negatives begin to appear after even just 20 minutes during the summer so be conservative with your sunbathing 3 Botox Cosmetic or Dysport Everyone has heard about or has used Botox Dysport is its new competition practitioners vary in their preference but dont worry you cannot go wrong with either Botox has longproven its safety and value For the vertical frown lines between the eyebrows those horizontal forehead lines and the squint or crows feet just aside the eyes the injections are terrific They can also be used to gently lift droopy eyebrows Yes they are not permanent but I see that as a plus If you dont like the results or dont feel the injections  several times a year  are worth the cost you can drop out of the program with no negatives If you like the results and think the cost is worth it you can continue Stay tuned I suspect medical science which never sleeps will soon be delivering longerlasting successors to Botox and Dysport A friend from Long Island and thus always a great skeptic sent me an advertisement from an airline magazine Apparently The Face Trainer is a helmetmask device that works out facial muscles for a natural looking lip The advertisement says no creams no injections no fuss  just 10 minutes a day and your Face Trainer is all you need to look younger and healthier The advertisement further states In a 60day clinical trial participants achieved 71 reduction in sagging skin I found that quite amazing but Im not sure what the clinical trial was I wonder if I asked for a copy of this clinical trial if they would have one for me I certainly did not see anything about it in a recognized medical journal If any product were that good you can bet I would know about it by now I wish life was that easy where all we had to do was wear a device and somehow our anatomy magically changes Our skin would look younger become tighter and all sags and bags would just go away Wow This would be real progress Sometimes I find these types of advertisements offensive because they demean the intelligence of the reader Despite the proclamation that products like this will give your face a lift without needles or knives dont expect a miracle And those wellchosen words without needles or knives are deliberately crafted by the writer of the ad to incite terror in the readers brain To scare you so that you make the emotional part of your brain believe this device can do what the common sense part of your brain says it cannot do Remember when something seems too good to be true it usually is There are many many causes for a rash but when one shows up in school teachers assume the worst They are worried about measles chicken pox Lyme disease scarlet fever Fifth disease impetigo herpes simplexzoster handfootmouth disease MRSA or roseola just to name a few It is this fear of imminent contagiousness that leads to the childs exclusion from school Sometimes the skin eruption is due to allergies such as hives or just a worsening dryskin condition like eczema atopic dermatitis Even a cold virus whether its in a cold thats at the contagious stage or not can cause a rash Fortunately for all of us most rashes that children get are not serious or contagious I have seen children excluded for insect bites hives sunburns poison oakivy eczema and even zits Teachers are not dermatologists so they are not going to make the diagnosis The school is just going to exclude the child and require a clearance note before the child can return I had a child excluded this week with poison oak Poison oak is not contagious but at least half of the people I encounter think that it is The oleoresin of the Rhus plant is definitely contagious but once this oil has been washed off of the contaminated skin clothing and other objects it can no longer cause trouble When people see this ugly rash oozing they assume the drainage is the poison This is not true Once the person takes a good shower and changes their clothes they do not need to be treated like they have leprosy High school wrestlers tend to get a variety of skin infections from those contaminated mats I see common warts molluscum another wartlike skin lesion impetigo a staph or strep skin infection and more recently MRSA a potentially serious drugresistant Staph infection Of course the wrestlers are also excluded from participation because of eczema mosquito bites and other noncontagious skin issues Referees and coaches are getting better in recognizing skin problems I must say Its not measles I must say this statement a dozen times a week contradicting home diagnoses made by daycare providers and grandmothers Measles is relatively rare in the United States now Personally I have not seen a case in over 20 years thanks to the effectiveness of vaccinations A few hundred to a few thousand cases still occur in the US depending on the year in unvaccinated individuals Mosquito and flea bites can mimic early chicken pox lesions but only for a short while Chicken pox varicella looks like a dew drop sitting on a rose petal It is a tiny blister on a red base which turns into a scab followed by a tiny crater pox in a day or so Although varicellaimmunized children can get a mild case it really does look different than mosquito bites Chicken pox is caused by the herpes virus so reexposure to this disease later in life can cause a reactivation of the virus resulting in herpes zoster also known as shingles Warts are contagious but not very much To exclude a child from school because of warts is really unnecessary It can take a month or more to effectively treat a case of stubborn warts freezing them with liquid nitrogen or chemically burning them with various acids High school wrestlers with warts can wrestle as long as they are covered by clothing or a bandage but many are excluded from participation by an eagleeyed referee Nothere is nothing effective over the counter for the treatment of condylomata genital warts caused by HPV There are other methods that can be used like podophylin in benzoin but this is not a doityourself method Acetyl salicylic acid is another treatment but both can leave you with severe burns on this very sensitive area Even if you could get a prescription I cannot endorse anyone trying to selftreat these HPV warts HPV condyloma are not the same as a common wart that can occur on your hand or foot If money is an issue try going to an American free clinic Many will treat these warts for free citizen or not A change in climate can certainly be a factor for a heat rash No acne is not caused or worsened by certain food or drinks This is a common misconception Acne is caused primarily by hormones that cause an over excetion of oil often made worse by certain bacteria found in acne lesions If your eight year old is having acne she may be starting to puberty which can occasionally happen this early She should see her medical provider Sugary drinks and sodas can make her fat but they will not cause zits Many people do This common skin condition should not be a problem with a tattoo Both The virus can be spread in both ways Peroxide will not cure anything definitely not Chlamydia or gonorrhea so keep that appointment on Monday if you think your sexual history and symptoms justify it There is an easy urine test that can give you the correct answer Expect a lecture about using condoms The penis is covered by skin and there are about a hundred reasons for itchingfrom allergy to your laundry detergentdryer softeners or soap to eczema or a fungal infection You cannot accurately diagnose yourself over the Internet so get a medical professional invovled If I cant SEE itfeel this lesion firsthandI cant identify it This is why you need to have a proper medical evaluation Yes any skincovered body surface is susceptible to a fungus but be careful of making dermatological selfdiagnosesmany skin conditions can mimic the appearance of a fungus You can try overthecounter antifungal medications to see if it helps but consider having a medical exam if you are not improving in about a week You most likely have chronic swimmers ear otitis externa BECAUSE you use Qtips Wax is not dirtit is a beneficial protective coating for the ear canalWhen you have a wax coating like your car water will bead up and easily fall out When you take out all of the wax water stays in the ear and breaks down the skinleading to a SKIN infection in your ear canal Other causes include eczema in the ear canal and even a fungalyeast infection This may be the flakes you are seeing Your first step is to be properly diagnosed See a dermatologist ENT or even your primary care provider You then will need to be properly treated depending on the specific cause While you are waiting for that appointment throw those Qtips in the trash and never use them again Read about alopecia areata Assuming this boy is not pulling out his own hair a nervous habit alopecia areata tinea capitus and other skin disorders should be considered I dont knowI have no way of seeing or examining your penis Your description is just too vague for me or any medical provider to make a blind guesslet alone a diagnosis As embarrassing as this may be for you the only way to have a definitive answer is to be examined Based on what you stated it would not be likely that you have an STD or anything serious There are many innocent skin lesions that can appear on the skin of the penis includingzits Clearly you are concerned so please get it checked out I cannot see your skin to know if this is the same condition as Michael Jacksonbut the disease is called  You should see a good dermatologist since there are several skin conditions that can cause a loss of pigment Both medications are compatible and can be taken at the same time Dont do your own penis surgery That would be stupid Obviously I cant see what you are talking about but you may have a penile bridge you can look this up on the Internet or a remnant from a circumcision A penile bridge can be cut by a urologist under a local anesthetic but to do it yourself would not be in your best interest These things are common and are not awkward to discuss with your medical provider Do the right thing and see a professional Mostly jaundice or the yellowing of the skin Mononucleosis can cause liver complications which can result in some jaundice It is realtively rare for mono to cause this problem however There can be many causes for itchy skin but one common cause that can occur in those areas would be atopic dermatitis eczema Experts say that atopic dermatitis is not a rash that itches but rather an itch that rashes so itching is the primary symptom Of course when these areas itch you will scratch This can create an itchscratch cycle that can only be broken by 1 take an antihistamine like Claritin or Zyrtec to control the itching 2 reduce the inflammation by using hydrocortisone cream and finally 3 do your best not to scratch especially to the point where you may break the skin This will set the stage for a secondary infection and make things worse I do endorse home surgery on a skin lesion especially one that you have selfdiagnosed as a ringworm See a dermatologist You will need to see a medical provider so you can have this lump properly examined A description is never sufficient information when making an accurate diagnosis As much as I would like to help you it would not be in your best interest to make blind guesses over the Internet You will not experience any harm Tetracycline is safe to be taking internally  a very common and older antibiotic available in capsule form I cant tell you what it is either since I cannot examine the area Unfortunately your description is not specific enough to narrow down the many possibilities My suggestion for yousince you have battled this skin affliction for four months now with various treatmentsis to see a dermatologist for a higherlevel evaluation If you have seen a dermatologist then see a different one for a second opinion I am sorry that I cant help you but there is no substitution or a handson evaluation The foreskin will automatically retract during intercourse that is the beauty of the design You need not retract it before insertion nor can you prevent it from retraction during sex If his penis is overly sensitive just slow down the process and make sure that the parts are well lubricated It will be fine The vast majority of men on this planet are uncircumcised just the way that God made them so things will be fine As far as penetration is concerned experiment with a few different positions It is likely that more than an inch is happening This should help you httpwwwwebmdcomskinproblemsandtreatmentsguideleprosysymptomstreatmentshistory I have never heard of a medical disorder caused by writing on yourself with ink Ink is not considered toxic I have to say it looks a bit odd so perhaps a piece of paper or note pad may be a better choice Absolutely NOT Leave that foreskin alone and do not try to retract it Not only will this be quite painful for the baby it will cause tears in this sensitive tissue and make it prone to an infection The foreskin is not retractable because of natural adhesions so leave it be It will naturally retract over time but not in six months It will more likely be six to eight YEARS or longer before this happens I know that may be contrary to what was believed when you as a grandmother had a little boy Most of the males on this planet are uncircumcisedjust the way the Nature intended An uncircumcised penis does not require any special care other than normal bathing without pulling the foreskin back I have no way of determining the severity of your sons tongue injury based solely on your posting but I can tell you that tongues have a remarkable ability to healfastwith little or no medical intervention In other words the tongue does not usually need to be sutured Ice cold drinks ice etc as well has a wet firm compress will stop the bleeding but if you are concerned you would need to see a medical provider for a handson assessment Be patient Accutane takes time to achieve its remarkable effects often one or two monthscertainly not eight days As a matter of fact things could actually appear worse before they get better namely in the way of dry cracked lips Your expectations of an immediate cure of your acne are unrealistic but you have been placed on the most effective acne medicine on the market It will work but you need to give TIME Good things will happen to those who wait Give it a rest It should heal spontaneously in a few days Keep using the antibiotic ointment If putting lemon and sugar on your face was therapeutic and effective for skin problems everyone would be doing it Lemons have high acid content and bacteria one of the underlying causes of acne is not found of acid but I have never read a study that supports this method Acne is caused by hormones and you really cant scrub hormones away Washing your face is fine for the oil but acne is not caused by dirty skin I am assuming that acne is your issue rather than put fruit all over your face as well as sticky sugar my suggestion would be for you to see your medical provider or a dermatologist for some expert advice There are so many excellent acne medications available to youand they are proven to be more effective than any home remedy As you know I have no way of seeing or examining youI have only your description to go on One possibility would be a  perhaps a cyst that is secondarily infected These oil gland cysts are quite common in this area but you will need to see a medical provider so that you can be properly examined and treated You have had this for a month so it would be in your best interest to check in checked out so you will not have to worry There are many things that can be done to control his acne from prescription antibiotic solutions to a variety of highlyeffected acne medications that his medical provider can prescribe However if he is just getting acnelike bumps from shaving he may have a condition called  These are really hair follicle infections Not shaving may not be an option but shaving will definitely make it worse I doubt that medicated or mentholated shaving cream will be the answer He may not know how to shave properly They dont teach this in school and his father or older brother may not have taken the time to instruct him Improper razors dull razors razors that are used by others in the shower to shave legsetc are not appropriate to use on his face Many young men are shaving their pubic areas so if he is using the same razor for both the North and South this can be part of the problem If he is using a wet razor it should be new and sharp Changing to an electric razor the does not trim as close is another option If all of these suggestions do not help he should see his medical provider for a proper assessment It could be the soap you are using in the shower or you just have atopic dermatitis a dry skin condition There are prescription creams and ointments that can be prescribed by your medical provider if your over the counter efforts are not helping Yeast can occur on the skin anywhere on the body but I would have no idea based on your description alone if yeast is an underlying culprit This problem has been going on for months now See a dermatologist or your primary care providerless expensive than moving to Canada You need to see a medical provider so you can be properly examined and treated which may involve lancing this lump depending on what it is This could be a thrombosed hemorrhoid a cyst abscess or  Your vague description is really not sufficient to make this important diagnostic call The ONLY way that your husband can be properly diagnosed is to see a medical professionaldermatologist for a handson examination What KIND of medication You may have a common case of balanitis due to yeast or even a bacterial infection but unfortunately this would take an examination to definitively determine  not something that can be accomplished over the Internet See your medical provider so you can be properly diagnosed and treated Your nephew had a common reaction to amoxicillin I see it a few times a month in my practice This is not an allergic reaction but merely an innocent side effect that usually happens toward the end of the amoxicillin course The rash will most likely fade in a few days Since he did have this reaction it would be best that he not take amoxcillin or similar penicillin drugs in the future Your toe needs medicallyevaluated but it is not really considered an emergency If you have the option seeing your regular medical provider or an urgent care facility may be more appropriate and less expensive The blood under the nail may need evacuated and the toe may need to be xrayed See your medical provider my worried friend This may be nothing Many men have tiny pearly papules on their penis I cannot make a diagnostic call based on a similarity to picture so you deserve a patientspecific answer Yes you can get a fungal infection on your hands Another common hand dermatitis is called dyshydrosis or dyshydrotic eczema I am very sorry but a diagnosis requires an examination  not something that can be accomplished on WebMD Answers Your description is vague and the possibilities are numerous Since the penis is covered by skin and you have a dermatologist seeing this professional would be advisable An accurate diagnosis  not a blind guess  is essential to get a patientspecific treatment regime In most cases your treatment will involve a prescription medication again not something that can be provided to you online As you know I have no way of examining your boyfriends large testicles over the Internet in order to specifically comment but a large scrotum may not be normal He could have a large hydrocele a fluidfilled cyst or even a inguinal herniaand it is also possible he just has large testicles I would recommend that he have them examined by a good urologist I have never weighed themnor reallly cared I am sorry that I could not address your question but I am curious as to WHY you are inquiring about it Cradle cap seborrheic dermatitis will selfresolve in time and should not leave any permanent skin discoloration You are engaging in some very very risky behavior by having any sexual contact with a prostitute Since you do not know the HIV or other STD status of this woman it would be wise to curtail this activity in the future While it would be unlikely to contact HIV in this manner you may need to be tested for your own peace of mind If a condom breaks during oral sex you would be susceptable to any ORAL disease this person may have some of which may be sexually transmitted Without the ability to examine you I really have no way to know if you have balanitis or not Dont post a picture Uncircumcised men are more prone to balanitis caused by yeast which likes warm dark moist places but this tends to itch and become red If you are just noticing a white area just watch it for a while If it persists you would need to see your medical provider or a urologist but it sounds innocent Hopefully you are using a condom There are no penis health creams As far as the color of your penis is concerned I am at a loss to comment since there is no ability to properly examine you via the Internet a photo would NOT help either Your vague description that your penis looks freaky does not help narrow down the many dermatological possibilities that can cause skin color changes so I would suggest that you SEE a medical professional such as a dermatologist  one who can examine the skin on your penis Dont be embarrassed Half of the people on this planet have penises and 85 of those are uncircumcised the way Nature made you You are going to need some medical helpa prescription for a special steroid cream that can help you retract your foreskin in about a month or so If not there are other methods that can be done Do NOT force the retraction to the point where you may be unable to pull it back again This can create a painful tourniquet from the tight foreskin This can be fixed my friend but you need to talk to your Mum I think she knows you have a penis even though she hasnt seen it for a while She can find you a male medical provider who can help Leave your penis alone assuming your dermatitis has resolved Allow your skin to recover without challenging it with additional creams and ointments I suspect it will return to its normal nonshiny appearance soon I dont knowI cant SEE it or EXAMINE you to be able to offer you a definite answer It could be a sebaceous cyst a localized skin infection or even a reactive preauricular lymph node You will need to physically see a medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated Since this lump is painful and tender I would suggest that you do this as soon as possible I cant physically see your toe to provide you with a patientspecific answer but redness is a sign of infectioninflammation  common in this area called an oncyhia or paronechyia It would be wise for you to seek proper medical attention if this problem persists or worsens You will need to take her to see a medical provider  someone who can examine this growth firsthand Obviously I have no way of seeing and examining her over the Internet There are a few possibilities one being a wart Any skin lesion in or near the genital area should be evaluated A description alone does not rule out or accurately diagnose genital herpes but based on what you have posted it seems less likely It may be folliculitis  an infection of a hair follicle but without the ability to exam a patient this is only a guess If you are concerned it is going to take an examination and perhaps a diagnostic test like a culture to provide you with the assurance that you deserve Based on what you have shared you would not likely be a candidate for using Accutane  a treatment for a specific type of acne called cystic acne or acne vulgaris I doubt you would find a dermatologist who would prescribe Accutane but this would require a dermatology consultation It would not be possible to blindly determine over the Internet if your prior injury  8 years ago  is somehow related to your current symptoms I think it would be wise for you to see an orthopedist and have a handson evaluation and some imaging studies Then you will hopefully know There can literally be hundreds of different reasons for hives urticaria but vitamin D deficiency is not one of them You can have your medical provider test your vitamin D level however and help you search for a possible cause of your hives The causes of psoriasis is really unknown I can vindicate the cats as a cause however Cats can cause allergic responses to the skin but cats do not cause psoriasis Wash you hands with running water cold or hotdoes not really make a difference and use SOAP The detergent breaks up the natural oils on the skin that trap dirt and dirt particles and will help the water wash it off I would be more concerned with you BREATHING in lead dust After using an effective scabicide drug that kills scabies the insects will die quite rapidly however the itching and irritation can persist for weeks Even dead insects under the skin can cause a sensitivity reaction so try and avoid scratching and digging can cause a secondary infection use an antiitch medication antihistamine and even a topical steroid cream Things should settle down soon This is why untreated scabies was often called the Seven Year Itch Hopefully you will be better long before this As far as I know sugars are not absorbed through the skin but that is an odd coincidence Bleaching the skin of your buttocks will not remove acne scars The ONLY way permanent scarring can be removed would be under the expert services of a cosmetic surgeon which may include chemical peel andor dermabrasion I am not sure why you are uncomfortable besides the idea that it may involve some discomfort and the fact that it is your butt exposed to the clinician See a female provider if you must I am not sure about the overall safety of bleaching darker pubic or anal skin areas so you should ask the cosmetic MEDICAL professional not the lay person who claims an expertise Yes a urologist can easily fix this extraskin issue with a minor office surgery Yes this can be surgically fixed You would need to see a urologist This would most likely be a simple office procedure to remove this extra skin if you find it to be a cosmetic issue Since you message is two hours old now WebMD Answers is not an emergency response service I suspect the bleeding has stopped by now In most cases these avulsiontype cuts will bleed quite freely but steady pressurecompression on the wound without peeking for at least ten minutes or so should suffice Compression and time will allow these tiny severed blood vessels to close Once the bleeding has stopped you can inspect your wound to see if suturing is requiried If so you have have an 8 hour or so window to have this done If the flap of skin has been completely severed and the wound is small it should heal and new skin will cover the area If the flap is hanging on and is pink means it has a viable blood supply allow this piece to cover the wound and it may regraft Obviously without seeing it it is difficult to offer you patientspecific advice Yes hives could be a side effect Nearly ALL medications have this potential but anyone takind a new medication would be suspicious that this may be the cause Keep in mind however that hives can be causes by hundreds of different things The thyroid is not under your chinit is in your neck Unfortunately since i cant see those lumpsfeel those lumpsI cannot blindly determine their nature based solely on your vague description If those lumps are shallow and moveable under your skin and you feel they are related to your acne they could be acne cysts You would need to see your medical provider or a dermatologist to be sure There is no way to offer you a patientspecific answer to your many questions since I have no way of examining your knee There is a good chance that your knee symptoms are completely unrelated to your foreign bodies but it is going to take a good orthopedic assessment and some imagining studies to see where you stand in this matter I dont knowI would have to physically examine the wound to know if you need sutures or not but you are now chasing the clock so to speak Wounds should be sutured in an 8 hour window and your posting says 14 hours ago See your medical provider for patientspecific advice  this wound needs to be examined Noyour numbness is caused by something else so please consult your medical provider You are taking the proper medications and appear to be under the care of dermatologist At age 34 acne is uncommon but as you know can affect adults I dont know if you are male or female and of course I have no way of seeing your acne or black scars over the Internet As much as I would like to offer you some profound insight it is very difficult to do so in this forum My only suggest is for you to keep working with a good dermatologist until this problem is controlledsolved I know it is frustrating but medical management is really your only option at this point Skin tags are often referred to as inflammatory tags since they are often caused by repeated inflammation Some people are born with skin tags however The often occur in the armpits from years of using underarm deodorant or shaving around areas where clothing may have rubbed around the anal area from a life of extensive paperwork They can be annoying they can itch they can get infected and more importantly they can be easily removed The most common method is a simple excision Once the area is properly numbed by lidocaine a medical provider may just painlessly snip them off with sterile scissors and cauterize the base to avoid bleeding Larger skin lesions and you can form whoppers may require a few little stitches to limit an ugly scar They can be frozen off with liquid nitrogen and even pitched to death by using a hemostat They can come back or new ones can form Since many skin lesions can mimic innocent skin tags it is best to have these office procedures done by a medical professional  someone who will most likely send them off to the lab for proper pathological analysis See your medical provider so you can have these painful lumps properly evaluatednot something that can be done blindly online If you are having unprotected sex even with someone that you assume is clean or STD free you are still at risk Many women who have Chlamydia or even gonorrhea contracted from a previous partner are not aware of it If you are now having a penile discharge not normal then it would be in YOUR best interest in finding out the reason It will also be in your partners best interest to know as well There are so many possibilities that it would not be in your best interest for me or any medical provider to blindly guess A description is not sufficient to make this important call Even dermaologists often cannot determine the true nature of a skin lesion just by looking at it Sometimes it need to be removed biopsy to have a pathologist examine it under a powerful microscope Whether than worry that this might be a skin cancer of some sort I would highly recommend that you see a dermatologist You have worried about this weird skin lesion for two years so it is time that you take it this one more important step and allow a professional to address your concern Without the ability to see this scab firsthand please dont post a picture it would be very difficult if not impossible to offer you a patientspecific recommendation The penis is covered by skin and skin can become irritated for a variety of reasons so I would suggest that you see a medical professional to have this allimportant examination It may just be an innocent skin tag quite common but unfortunately this would require an examination to confirm A description is really not sufficient to make a blind diagnosis Next time ask your medical professional during an examination in this area She is not a vegetarian if she eats pork pig skin These things are quite fatty so if she does get ill it may not be the result of an allergy but rather from an excess of ANIMAL FAT in her socalled vegetarian diet You do realize that the experts on WebMD have no way of seeing your skin lesions nor examining youessential components for any medical professional in making an accurate diagnosis Because of the duration of your skin problem 45 years now it would be important for you to see a dermatologist  an expert and someone that can examine you firsthand You do not want to trust a blind guess See a medical provider so that you can be properly examined and treated There is really no way to make a blind determination as to the signficance of this tear fissure based soley on a very brief posting As you knowI cant see or examine you and your description is vague Look up ganglion cyst on the Internet  this is one possibility of many This is called  a common complication of your circumcision The ONLY way to fix this is to have it surgically corrected not something you can do at home Steroid creams often help with simple adhesions but not bridging So as soon as you get insurance go see a urologist and have it fixed permanently In most cases it is a simple office procedure under local anesthesia I agree with the nurse practitionerusing tiny amounts of estrogen cream just on the areas that are adherent is SAFE and highlyeffective There are little or no side effects if you use this hormonal ointment sparingly and periodically Many of my patients with labial adhesions need to use it again and again to control this very common problem Soon your little girl 4 or five more years will be making her own estrogen and it will not likely be an issue You are most likely getting hives Hives can be caused by the temperature change that you mentioned You can try taking a longacting antihistamine before these warm season exposures loritidine Zyrtec Allegra to see if it helps Urticaria caused by temperature changes may not be prevented by antihistamines however but it is worth a try Keeping your skin surface cooler would also seem to be a reasonable preventative wearing clothing that breathes Yes it is definitely possiblebut it is a prolonged process with a odd device that stretches any residual foreskin It doesnt look comfortable and likely to be expensive and not covered by insurance Many circumcised men long for their lost foreskins but perhaps you should just get over itforgive your parents who may have been misinformed or influenced by society While restoration is possible it will never be as good as the original uncut version How do you know they are bug bites There are many skin lesions that can mimic bug bites There are no particular kind of insect that only bites in the diaper area If it is a biting bug then MANY types could do this The type of bug may not be as important as a proper diagnosis so I would strongly suggest that you child see a pediatrician or dermatologist so that these socalled bites can be medically evaluated and treated This is called cold urticaria one of the more unique types of hives You can try using an antihistamine before cold exposure but it still may happen Unfortunately there is little that can be done other than avoiding these cold situations It could be HUNDREDS of different dermatological conditions and it would be impossible to blindly guess what you have over the Internet Since this has been going on for two months perhaps it is time for you to see a medical professional  dermatologist so that you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated Yes you can see a urologist and agree to a circumcision if you feel this is what you would like to do There are other ways to fix this problem so the urologist will discuss it with you If you are still on your parents insurance they may get some indication that you have a visit to the urologist but since you are considered a legal adult the only way they could find out is if you told them It may have sometime to do with your fallwinter attire Many of these boils start out as folliculitis an infection around the hair follicles so heat andmoisture in this area can be contributory to seasonal outbreaks I dont know if you are shaving in this area but this too can be a factor Rubbing alcohol quickly evaporates and will not penetrate intact skin You will be just finenothing bad will happen Your husband will need to see a medical provider  a dermatologist if you can This is really the best way to determine if this mole is problematic or not like a skin cancer This cannot be determined blindly by a description Assuming you have the medical skills to examine someones hands to rule out a herpetic lesion herpetic whitlow keep in mind that a person can shed the herpes viruses like from shingles etc when an active lesion is not obvious No but carrots and sweet potatoes can do it carotene Just keep the area clean perhaps use an antibacterial ointment or cream for a few days These areas tend to heal very fast Also avoid any trauma to this area until it has healed This includes sexual activity Unfortunately your description of white tags is very vaguenot sufficient to make a definitive diagnosis You will need to see a gynecologist to have a proper examination to determine the true nature of these tags and a proper treatment Cocoa butter is not absorbed through the skin into the systemic circulation so it should not have any adverse effects on your cholesterol I cant tell you if these are warts or notyour description is not the same as a firsthand examination They could be common warts or even molluscum but I would need to see it Since I cannot you need to see her medical provider for a definitive diagnosis and recommend treatment Warts if these are warts are caused by human papilloma viruses not vitamin deficiency Giving her vitamins will not help No cure other than Tincture of Time Most of these areas of pigmentation caused by skin disorders will fade over time There are no specific treatments You most definitely need medical attention They may have used a product called Gel Foam or equivalent If this is the case just leave it alone The skin on your fingertip should eventually regenerate and cover the missing piece assuming the piece was not too large When in doubt see your primary care medical provider for an evaluation You dont have insurance and I cant see them over the Internet so we have a dilemma The only way that you can get an accurate diagnosis is for him to see a medical provider or dermatologist but your guess is very good These may indeed be molluscum contagiosum  very common childhood skin eruption If you didnt see the dent in the middle called an umbilication look closer with a magnifying glass It may be there You can see them but unfortunately I cannot Dermatological problems require a handson examination either your primary care provider or a dermatologist An accurate diagnosis  not something that I could blindly give you based solely on your very brief vague description  is the most important step in determining the proper treatment I would be wondering as well but you cannot make an important diagnostic call based solely on a brief description Any skin lesion that is painful or changing deserves to have a professional look at it firsthand If the dermatologist is not sure not all skin lesions can be identified by appearance alone then it may be recommended to have it surgically removed You would then have a cure since it would be gone and a pathological diagnosis  the most accurate Your foreskin will not regrow no matter what your wife has told you The ONLY way to restore a lost foreskin from circumcision is with plastic surgery or using a scarylooking device designed to restretch any remaining foreskin residuals I suspect both are expensive and probably not that comfortable What is gone is gone As long your penis still works just leave it alone and silently blame your parents for being misinformed about the advantages and disadvantages of circumcision It is next to impossible to make a blind determination as to the nature of red bumps on the buttocks and genitals but I could offer you one possibility that may answer the question Obviously your friend would need to SEE a medical provider  someone who can actually examine her firsthand  to be sure Have your friend research to skin condition called  Molluscum Contagiosum  These are one type of tiny little red bumps that have a little induration or belly button in the center They can definitely spread on the person who has them and to others who have a close contact If you put the world photo after the name of this skin disorder the Internet will reward you with some photos to compare No diet or exercise is going to help Use the betamethasone cream and manual stretching but be careful Do not keep the foreskin forcibly retracted or you may create a painful condition called paraphimosis I do not know you age but your glans should be fully retractable in your early teen years or before unless you have some adhesions tissue still attached Without an exam I cannot comment Rather than treat yourself a consultation with a good urologist now may be beneficial to you The penis is covered by skin and skin can itch for hundreds of reasons A common cause would include yeast balanitis or simple dry skin like you described Contact dermatitis allergy to soaps or laundry detergent is another possibility A yeast infection would respond to an overthecounter antifungal cream dry skin or allergic rashes will respond favorably to hydrocortisone cream followed by a moisturizer Some people mix them together and use both so this may be something to try If it doesnt work see your medical provider or a dermatologist for a consultation and exam Leave it alone There are natural adhesions attaching the head of the penis to the foreskin at this age Forcibly retracting the foreskin can be very painful so just clean what you can see It may be red because you are causing very tiny microtears in his foreskin Some children do have very tight foreskins so please allow the pediatrician to make that determination during an examination Most of the menboys in the world are uncircumcised just the way Nature made them As he ages those natural adhesions will resolve and his foreskin will completely retract If not there are prescription steroid creams that can be used to help it along In my pediatric practice I rarely intervene medically until age 7 or 8 unless the foreskin is supertight and it balloons when he urinates If this is the case a pediatric urologist should be consulted Absolutely not Your foreskin is a natural protection for the glans head of the penis It is supposed to cover this area just like your eyelid covers your eyes and your lips cover the inside of your mouth Most of the men on this planet are uncircumcised like you Be proud to have the uncut version The foreskin will pull back when it is needed so you can have the best of both versions You will need to have your medical provider examine this area carefully Unfortunately your description is really not sufficient to make this important call How about a third choice Your primary care medical provider should be able to help you with this relativelycommon proble A urologist is fine as well but the visit is expensive and it may take longer to get an appointment Unfortunately it would not be possible for me or any medical provider to be able to diagnosis a rash without actually seeing it firsthand A description is really not sufficient to make this important diagnostic call and without a diagnosis treatment suggestions would also not be possible You will need to see a medical provider or dermatologist so that you can be be properly diagnosed and treated Nothe rate of fingernail growth will not changeaccelerate if the other nail is removed As a matter of fact the old nail can help protect the very sensitive nail bed as the new nail gradually grows out again This would be highly unlikely however I do not know what TYPE of cyst you are talking about and where it is located There is always an increased risk of transmission even with the care that was exercised A person with herpes is clearly more contagious during an active outbreak but shedding of the virus can occur even when an outbreak is not obvious Herpes viruses can remain on objects for hours While the chance of transmission may be very small because of the caution that was exercised it would not be zero There is often some free bleeding during an abdominal procedure and this free blood can migrate South through the inguinal canal directly to your scrotum This could be one reason for the discoloration The swollen penis defies and easy explanation since I cant examine you and I hope that you will not try to post a picture I dont believe it is really to the catheter use There are some strange things that happen in the OR after you fall asleep so I hope that you were not accidentally traumatized by someone leaning their elbow on your junk to rest As a novice student in the operating room I once leaned my arm for an extended period on his thigh The next day when I made round to ask about his abdominal incision he said it was fine but his thigh was killing him When I was 22 I was under general anesthesia to get my wisdom teeth extracted I ended up with a huge bruise from my buttocks to my thigh I suspect I accidentally fell off of their operating table but no one said a word The mystery still haunts me During your postop visit you need to show the condition of your genitals to your surgeon for a patientspecific explanation I dont know the type of surgery you had My guess is that time will return your genitals to their normal appearance soon It may be a while before you can proudly pose nude for a magazine I hope that your surgery went well and you are now on the road to recovery Many reasonsmoisture accumulation atopic dermatitis tinea pedis Athletes foot chemical reactions to shoes or detergents left in your socks bare feet etc In order to get a patientspecific answer you will need to see a medical provider so that your feet can be properly examined and you can be definitively diagnosedtreated You need to see your medical provider again You may have postherpetic neuralgia  a painful condition after having Shingles There are treatments for this but they are prescriptions There is absolutely no medical reason for you to be circumcised as a 70 year old male Your minor urinary incontinence and urgency after prostate surgery is common and circumcision will not change this issue I seriously doubt you will find a urologist willing to subject to this procedure Potentially yes It happens to wrestlers all of the time Ringworm is not a worm as you may know but a skin fungus It is not likely that the acetaminophen Tylenol component of your medication is causing the crawly skin sensation You will need to speak with your prescribing medical provider about alternative pain medications that may be appropriate for you You may have a medical condition called BALANITIS  Please see your medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated A medical provider or dermatologist would have to physically SEE these spots and examine you A vague description of dry scaly spots is really not sufficient to make an accurate diagnosis That is sufficient unless of course you want to just move and find a new house Scabies are human skin parasitesthey live under the skin and are spread by close direct contact usually not just a casual contact Dont freak out the general cleaning and laundry should be fine Yesbabies can get ringworm  a common fungal infection There are many overthecounter antifungal creams that are safe for babies Your pediatrician andor pharmacist can help you select one to use If you are making a selfdiagnosisbe careful There are many other skin lesions that can mimic the appearance of ringworm tinea corporis When it doubt see a medical professional A dermatologist would be a good choicetheir specialty is skin and many of them will do office procedures assuming this growth needs to be removed Many primary care providers will do this too but you will need to talk to your own to see if this is something he or she will see This can be many things including a retained foreign body like a splinter The true nature of this mysterious raised area cannot be determined without a careful examination hopefully at a time when it is evident to the medical examiner Your description is just not sufficient to make a blind guess so you will need to wait for your upcoming gynecological appointment or better yet get a sooner appointment while this abnormality is present This is really the only way to know No At age 13 this is a bit unusual He may have a condition called phimosis This may need to be treated with topical steroids for a minor amount of foreskin adhesions or a minor surgical procedure so take him to see a urologist You should have a medical provider examine ANY suspicious moles especially those that are darker The most common side effect of this treatment is what you are experiencing namely burning and irritation Assuming you have used this agent properly the cure rate is higher than some other methods The chemical podophyllotoxin causes necrosis and destruction of the condyloma and a bit of the surrounding healthy tissue This can appear burned white or even black This is expected Soon this damaged tissue will heal and you should be returning to normal but you will need to be carefully examined again since some of the smaller condyloma may have escaped destruction and will also need carefully treated It depends on how good he is as a visual diagnostician Genital herpes does have a characteristic appearance and history but when someone give you a medicine for a bacterial vaginosis a herpes medicine and a yeast medicine he is doing shotgun treatmentsort of throwing everything at the issue hoping one will hit it I dont practice that way If your problem started with an itch and a bit of peeling I think yeast Bacterial vaginosis can have a characteristic odor and yeast can have a characteristic appearance but it would be best to confirm it with a diagnostic test usually a microscopic exam or vaginal culture The same goes for herpes There is a very accurate diagnostic test when you have active lesions that would have given you the answer Since herpes is contagious and recurrent it would sure be nice to know definitively I agree with you You need to know for sure and deserve a higher level of care than a two minute look and see It would not be possible to accurately diagnose a dermatological skin condition by description photograph or not If this problem has been troubling you for 57 years it is time for you to see a good dermatologist when your hand is actively peeling Possibilities include chemical dermatitis contact with certain chemicals soaps detergents etc in your environment to dyshydrotic eczema often called dishpan hands common in people who exposed their hands to water or wash them often Eczema may fit the bill based on your description but a handson no pun intended examination would be best Yes a yeast infection can do this Rather than assume they are both connected you would be wise to see your medical provider for an examination and prescription treatment You do realize that I have no way of examining you over the Internet  the only way to offer you a patientspecific answer Your description is just too vague for me to even guess if you have inflammatory skin tags Polyps Warts condylomata or hemorrhoids If you have had these things for four years perhaps it is time for you to be properly diagnosed Since your regular medical provider did not offer you an answer then seen a gastroenterologist or proctologist This is really their department What is better is a moisturizing cream or lotion Exposure to humidity  steam or cool mist  is not going to be absorbed through your skin and make it moist again Chronically dry skin is usually genetic atopic dermatitis eczema and will likely improve by a good nonperfumed moisturizer and perhaps some topical steroids but if you want to increase your humidity for other reasons the cool mist the ultrasonic types are the best in my opinion I cant tell you why since I have no way of examining you and I do not know your age or body weight body weight can be contributory do to a fat pad located around the penis Since you are worried and scared I would suggest that you get an appointment with a good urologist for a highlevel evaluation of this new event I have no way of determining what you have based solely on your brief description I do not know anything about you your age your medical history etc In order to be properly diagnosed you will need to see a medical provider  someone who can take a more detailed medical history and more importantlysomeone who can examine you Your testicles are too important to rely on a blind guess via the Internet There is probably little or nothing that can be done medically to make you grow facial hair If those hair follicles were not present when you were born you cant grow new ones It is too late to change your parents and genetics so the amount of facial hair that you have now is about all you will get I dont think that medicines used for patchy baldness in men will work the same way on your face but that would be up to your doctor or a dermatologist to determine Testosterone a male hormone can cause some facial hair growth in men how are low but again if you do not have those follicles it may not help Your first step is to see a dermatologist NOyou should not take ANYTHING especially an antibiotic when you are pregnant unless it was specifically prescribed for you for this condition by your OB doctor Besides I dont know that is cause of your cysts nor did you disclose what kind of antibiotic you want to use Let you doctor treat this problem Unfortunately without the ability to actually see this skin eruption that you are describing it would be very difficult if not impossible to blindly offer an accurate diagnosis A diagnosis is really essential when it comes to treatment Knowing your medical history will also help solve this mystery rash Based solely on your description this could be an allergic reaction perhaps urticaria hives Hives are intensely itchy comes on suddenly and if the allergen is still in your midst it can continue to persistspread Regardless of the cause which can be very challenging to find the itchiness can be treated with an antihistamine like diphenhydramine Benadryl or other overthecounter medications in this class Seeing a medical provider is important since many things can mimic hives Hello i have googled this specific question with the intention of answering all the queries that exist on the web with regards to this question because i myself had been suffering this for the last 4 months and it made me feel really sick uneasy and tired and i hated the feeling of having to always keep myself in cool places and have to have three baths a day to just feel normalI finally found the cure in an unlikely place I have always had a little feeling of sickness when in warm places since a young age but it got really bad 4 months back and every normal doctor i went to did all medical checks but all parameters such as blood pressure temperature and blood test etc were normal but i still was feeling heat since i am in india somebody suggested i visit an ayurvedic doctorayurvedic doctors are doctors who prescribe medicines and treatments according to an ancient indian text called the ayurveda httpenwikipediaorgwikiAyurveda so i made the trip to a well known ayurvedic doctor at the rejuvenation center at an ashram called isha in coimbatore tamil nadu india and the doctor there just felt my wrist and started her diagnosis and without me even telling her the symptoms she said everything is normal but there is a lot of heat trapped in your system and she said it is not a very rare problem she said that no mainstream medicine doctor has been able to diagnose it till date cause there is no such thing as body heat in allopathicmainstream medicine there is only temperature she said in ayurveda its called ushnaheat and she said no need to go into the cause of it just have these ayurvedic medicines and i have been having them for three days now and i can feel the heat slowly leaving my system i am suppose to take the medicines for 40 days but just today being the third day i am already feelin 60 better and ease has returned to the whole body and she also gave me some medicines to repair the minor damage to the system from this heat so i would like to suggest to anybody who is having this problem that if no doctor is able to help then please no matter what country you are in please look for a good ayurvedic or siddhahttpenwikipediaorgwikiSiddhamedicine doctor nowadays they are all over the world and if there isnt one in your country then do make the trip to india and i highly recommend the one i went to even if it is expensive to make the trip it is better to spend that then live with the problem for the rest of your life or contact them at httpwwwishafoundationorgIshaRejuvenation they might be able to ship the medicines if you are in a different country hope youll all get okay soon cause i have been through the frustrating experience of going to many mainstream doctors and not finding a solution till this happened and i feel like a real fool for doubting that any alternative medicine science could actually have something very simple but powerful in it I wold suggest you get to an ER ASAP I recently had these symptoms and it turned out to be prostatitis How it happens thy dont know You are a young man should not be having this problem in your young life However there could be something else relative to kidneys Get to the ER or your primary physician NOW Old Time method was used by my mother Believe if you want try if you want it has no side effects if tried You must have patience for you need to topically apply hydrogen peroxide directly to the tags as often as you can by QTip for example It seems like it isnt working but if you have the patience they slowly disappear Check with your Doctor for safety of doing it for you but my Doctor was younger and said OK If you havent yet talked to a Pharmacist you should There are some good topical creams ointments and shampoos that could help you They can recommend something over the counter as you may need a prescription form a doctor to get something stronger from the Pharmacy that might work for you Hi When birthmarks change over time many parents worry that it is a sign that it represents something worrisome In this case however you are describing a very common and very normal hemangioma often referred to as a strawberry hemangioma because of the raised appearance The changes that youve already noted  going from spotty to more filled in to actually raised are all normal You can expect for it to grow in size for up to the first 1218 months of life and then they naturally start involuting or going away on their own Even though they grow initially they eventually go away to the point that at some point during early childhood you will no longer be able to see it at all Imagine that  a vanishing birthmark Whoops typo 16 not 26 birth control was very helpful in the olden days does it still work for that I can only state that after having lumpnodes removed from breast cancer did I have the same feelings Dont scare your sister but has she had a mamogram recently The armpit though most forgotten has a lot to give The change of skin on any part of the body should be noted When itching comes and goes and color change should be looked at by a physician as there are a number of conditions that could be occuring Maybe a change in laundry detergents or body wash but any and all changes in skin color and itching needs to be addressed by a physician Of course wearing protection for yourself  others is advised Renova Retin A online is a topical medication that can be applied to get rid of mild to moderate acneBut it is advisable that you order Renova Retin A from any online pharmacies only after first confirming with your healthcare professional For more information on Renova Retin A visit wwwgenericprinivilcomgenericrenovaretina Because he is only 14 his penile skin is still growing and developing My concern is that if you stretch it too much or too fast it can actually cause more scarring and result in even tighter foreskin and more damage so that circumcision will be his only choice  obviously the wrong direction I suggest you see and talk to a urologist to talk about testosterone cream that may help Even better seek out and talk to a pediatric urologist who specializes in just urologic issues with boys and teens Hair grows from follicles not glands Im female but Ive had both acne in my case its rosacea and ingrown hairs Ingrown hairs are awful I used to dig my face apart trying to get them out along with the comedones blackheads and pimplescysts Plus Ive had another type of cyst that causes calcifications like having little pieces of gravel under the skin generally thats something that happens less in young people and more in people over 50 These hard cysts when removed can sometimes be dark in color The skin makes melanin the pigment that causes suntans in lightskinned people and that creates skin tone in darkerskinned people When the glands that produce melanin become blocked by certain cysts what youre describing can result My father had a cheek cyst for years that was lanced by a dermatologist and almost exploded Skin can do some disturbing things Its the largest organ of the body However there is one concern here the possibility of skin cancer My father had it repeatedly my uncle had it Im at risk for it and everybody should look out for it and practice sun safety People with chronic skin problems that involve the immune system and actual skin damage which severe lifelong acne does may be at higher risk for it Consult a dermatologist but be prepared the wait for an appointment is long and some insurances may resist paying for it A referral from your primary care provider may be necessary In my mouth and nostrils Could be blood poisoning Could be a liver issue too much sun and sometimes synthetic hormones will cause brown spots in which case they will disappear after a while Taking tricyline will also cause brown spots no never yes rashes and itching at the very least wash your hair  face frequently using a mild soap if that doesnt work you may have the beginning of psoriasis in which case there are numerous OTC meds to treat it The possibilities include an infection trauma an erupting tooth or normal pigmentation Either way I would strongly suggest a visit to the pediatric dentist for an evaluation of the problem There are many possibilities such as an aphthous ulcer or canker sore an abscess or an erupting tooth If your child is in any pain I would recommend a trip to the pediatric dentist for an evaluation Food and drinks like coffee red wine and tea can discolor the teeth on the outside But those drinks arent for children Sodas are the worst possible drinks due to the high acid content Acid in the saliva allows cavities to form and grow on your teeth There are many possibilities such as canker sores trauma from hot food or utensils infection or a tumor The advice you received is accurate If it goes away dont worry about it The first thing to do is stop the biting or sucking that may be causing the blisters Petroleum jelly hydrocortisone and oral antiinflammatories are all possible aids in helping you heal Skin peeling can be caused by food drink mouthwash reflux medicinal side effects trauma burning aspirin and a host of other possibilities See your local dentist for an evaluation I have found that Neosporin makes anti itch cream daily moisturizing cream and body wash for eczema It is called Neosporin Eczema Essentials I use the moisturizing cream on my hands and feet and it works great I found it at Walgreens but it is a little pricey but I think it is well worth the money no One of the best moisturizing ingredients for aging skin is hyaluronic acid This is a natural substance produced by the body and it will bind molecules of moisture to your complexion This is helpful for aging skin because hydration is the key to a soft and supple texture to your skin tone On top of that focus on drinking water to stay hydrated and improve elasticity in your skin During the fall and winter seasons there is a decrease of humidity in the atmosphere This decrease in humidity is usually what causes the skin on our bodies to become dry and rough The first step you can take toward healthy skin is to look at the body wash or bar you use in the shower Avoid shower gels in the winter as they can be drying to your skin A body wash or bar that contains shea butter or jojoba oil will help to hydrate and nourish your skin while you are in the shower Shea butter is extracted from the nuts found on the sheakarite tree This tree can only be found growing in the tropics of Africa Shea butter nourishes the skin with vitamins A and E and it also penetrates and moisturizes the skin without clogging pores Jojoba oil comes from the seed of the jojoba tree simmondsia chinensis The jojoba tree is a perennial shrub that can be found in northwestern Mexico and parts of Arizona and California This oil is actually a wax ester that is very similar to the oil or sebum our skin produces naturally Jojoba oil can help to balance the oil in your skin and can also provide moisture all day Taking lukewarm showers instead of hot showers can also ward off dry skin If you do not want to give up taking a hot shower try to cut your shower time down Long hot showers tend to draw out the natural moisturizers in your skin Avoiding long soaks in the hot tub is also a good idea because the chemicals and the hot water can dry out your skin After you shower you should apply a moisturizer to replenish your skin You can apply baby oil to your skin before drying off this is one of the best ways for moisture to penetrate your skin After you dry off try using jojoba oil shea butter or cocoa butter they work even better if they contain Vitamin A and E Exfoliate the skin on your body once a week Try to find a salt or sugarbased scrub While you are in the shower apply the scrub all over your body Next rinse the scrub off This should help slough away any dry skin you have Always follow up with a moisturizer after exfoliating your skin If you live in an area that has a dry atmosphere such as the desert a humidifier is a good investment for your home The heat from the furnace can draw out the natural moisture and humidity in the air A humidifier can help to add moisture back into the air in your home and also assist in warding off dry skin A wellbalanced diet is also an important step for healthy skin Be sure to eat plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables especially green vegetables These foods will help to naturally nourish your skin Including fish in your diet is also great for your skin because it is a natural source of omega fatty acids The fatty acids can help to moisturize dry and scaly skin from the inside out One last tip Limit your caffeine intake because it can also dehydrate the skin Smoking is a very unhealthy habit to start in your lifetime Not only can using tobacco products cause cancer and heart disease but it can also affect the complexion of your skin and cause you to age prematurely The byproducts found in tobacco products deprive the skin of oxygen and vital nutrients This deprivation can lead to a pale and uneven skin tone If you begin smoking at a young age changes in your skin can begin to be seen early on There are more than 4000 chemicals found in tobacco smoke many of these harmful chemicals encourage the destruction of collagen and the elasticity of the skin Even being around secondhand smoke can cause deeper wrinkles and sagging of the skin Now lets discuss how smoking physically affects the appearance of your face and body Smoking loosens the skin around the eyes causing deep wrinkles and crows feet Deep lines and wrinkles can also develop around the mouth from dragging on your cigarette this look is also known as the smokers pucker Your breasts can also begin to droop and fall prematurely The skin on the back of your upper arms can also start to sag You are also more prone to develop age spots liver spots on the face and body Your fingers and fingernails can begin to turn yellow or brown after years of smoking however these stains will begin to fade after you quit smoking Smoking also increases your chances to develop alopecia hair loss Now that you know how the use of tobacco products affects can your appearance lets look at some of the benefits of quitting smoking Once you quit smoking your circulation improves this leads to an increased amount of oxygen and nutrients delivered to the skin Some of the damage from smoking can be reversed by using retinoids antioxidants such as A and C vitamins and chemical peels Make an appointment with your dermatologist to see what skincare regimen is best for you Here are some overall health benefits that come with the cessation of smoking After 20 minutes your blood pressure and heart rate decrease After 24 hours your risk of a heart attack begins to drop After a few weeks the cilia will begin to sweep impurities from the lungs again After a year you decrease your risk of a heart attack by half If you want to quit smoking and you are having trouble consult your physician Cleansing your face should remain a simple process The first step is to wash your face no more than twice per day with a gentle soap and warm water Step 2 Exfoliate the dead skin cells with an exfoliating agent that contains a mild salicylic acid or glycolic acid Step 3 Rehydrate your skin with natural oils that will not clog your pores such as almond oil or avocado oil Moisturizers should be applied lightly primarily to seal in the moisture but not to clog your pores You are wise to begin treatment so quickly for your shingles infection This will help to limit its spread However even on medication the shingles lesions are going to erupt where the infection initially began because it is present before the rash develops Hopefully yours will be a mild case and being on medication will limit the extent to which it will spread Dry skin is a frustrating condition and winter makes it even worse If you have a moisturizer that does not burn then you should stick with that Here are a few more dry skin tips for winter  Take warm showers not hot When possible rinse in cooler water This helps your skin to not overrespond to the hot water by becoming more dry and red  After showering washing your face or hands be sure to dry your skin completely with a dry towel Im not sure why this is but we tend to only partially dry our hands during the winter and this will contribute to the development of really dry skin that is prone to cracking and breaking  Use a humidifier in your room Winter air is dry and your skin suffers from this Raising the humidity in your home will help your overall symptoms  Obviously you want to stay well hydrated so drink plenty of water and watercontaining beverages eat fruit and vegetables Stay away from caffeine and alcohol because they dehydrate you It is possible that you have a form of eczema that is causing your fingers to peel and crack Many people experience a flareup of this type of eczema especially when they change environments This means a change of climate humidity sometimes food water etc Some people notice that their flareups occur when they have allergy symptoms and can benefit from antihistamines as well as using creams or lotions that do work Try to notice if your condition ever improves Make a note of the things in your life that are different and see if you can get an upper hand on this Treating it with steroid cream is one way to keep it from cracking to the point of bleeding Your fingernails protect your fingers and when you broke the nail down so far you exposed skin that hasnt been exposed previously So yes you have probably hit a nerve but you hit nerves any time you bump yourself What youre feeling is nerve endings that are more sensitive due to this unexpected exposure It will go away in time Keep the area protected from further injury Your concern about the loose skin is a common one in an individual who has lost a great deal of weight sometimes quickly While your skin is adaptable it can take quite a bit of time for it to return to its more firm suppleness after experiencing weight loss as you have done Try not to expect it to get better overnight or even in a couple of weeks Youre young enough that it is not necessarily recommended to seek surgery to take care of the excess skin If it continues to be a problem after several months you could discuss it But Im sure you will find that by that time it will be much better In the meantime continue to eat nutritiously exercise wisely and enjoy life Bloodred spots may be attributed to dilated small vessels on your face or telangiectasia The majority of these red spots are benign However on occasion they are associated with other medical conditions such as acne rosacea scleroderma and birthmarks Your first step is to exclude any underlying medical conditions Then your physician may recommend a topical product or laser treatment Dry skin associated with hypothyroidism requires more hydration and added moisture than normal or oily skin If your skin is itchy consider using calamine lotion or overthecounter cortisone cream Implement hydrating solutions that contain natural oils such as avocado or almond oil which will hydrate the skin without causing an allergic reaction Overly aggressive scrubbing of your skin may damage the top layer of your skin If your objective is to remove dead skin cells consider using gentle exfoliating agents that contain salicylic acid glycolic or papayabased products In addition use cleansers that contain jojoba beads Jojoba beads are gentle spherical exfoliants that do not scratch the skins surface I suggest that you cleanse your face twice daily with soap and water Pack a premoistened cleansing pad if you wont be around a water basin throughout the day Shower or bathe in tepid water rather than steaming hot water Hot water can strip your skin of needed moisture while cold water can shock your skin Avoid using cleansers or toners that tend to overdry skin or have high alcohol content This overdrying actually causes your skin to produce even more oil than usual Use only noncomedogenic moisturizers and sunscreen products This means theyre oilfree and wont clog pores Use vitamin A derivatives or retinoids which reduce production in oil glands and shrink their size Menopause can effect estrogen production Estrogen is critical in the production of oil glands and collagen Estrogen levels are also associated with your cells ability to maintain hydration To help your skin cells avoid hot showers because they tend to further dry out your skin Consume foods rich in essential fatty acids These will help your cells with natural oil production Finally use sun protection Sun damage is the No 1 cause for premature aging of the skin Avoid direct sunlight between the peak hours 11 am to 2 pm Sunblock is probably your best approach to avoid premature aging and dark spots Your skin regimen should include steps to exfoliate and get rid of dead skin cells hydrate and rejuvenate with natural amino acids or peptides Hyperpigmentation discoloration or postinflammatory hyperpigmentation PIH on your skin can be attributed to a variety of disorders I like to begin with excluding any medical reasons that may result in hyperpigmentation Hyperpigmentation may be attributed to renal disease diabetes or peripheral vascular disease PIH arises from an acquired excess of pigment related to an inflammatory process such as infection an allergic reaction a reaction to medication or a trauma PIH often occurs as a consequence of inflammatory skin disorders including acne druginduced eruptions and eczema Once you have excluded medical causes there are multiple options to regain your even skin tone A combination of glycolic acid AHA and tretinoinbased products  along with a traditional topical skin care regimen  will work for skin brightening Hydroquinonebased products work well However there are other alternatives such as bearberry kojic acid licorice extract and niacin These compounds will work towards brightening your skin and correcting your skin tone The key is to work with a physician that is very familiar with your skin type and color because incorrect use of these agents can lead to further hypo or hyperpigmentation I tell my AfricanAmerican patients in particular that in order to get your skin in shape it has to be a gradual process similar to exercising You would not attempt to lift 250 lbs on the first day of your workout this attempt may lead to injuring yourself and disastrous results The same holds true with your skin regimen a gradual approach is always best Once you get your melanocytes in shape and under control you can improve your skin tone Delayed hypersensitivity to the metal in your ring is not uncommon even after several years The most common allergy is nickel Most 14k to18k gold rings contain a small amount of nickel A quick fix is to apply a small amount of clear nail polish on the inside of the ring so that the metal is not in direct contact with your skin Typically platinum rings cause less of a reaction Also if you are wearing your ring continuously while washing your hands and doing other chores the accumulated grease and oil will cause a reaction Simply try removing the ring throughout the day and allow the skin underneath to get some air You may be suffering from hormonal acne Up to 50 of all women experience some form of adult hormonal acne the week before their period Some women are even more prone to adult acne because they have larger problems with androgens These are women with polycystic ovarian syndrome Because the overabundance of androgens throws their monthly cycles completely off kilter they never know when theyll experience an acne breakout Most women who suffer from adult hormonal acne experience their worst breakouts on their chin and around their lips Adult hormonal acne typically begins after age 25 and occurs on and off during the course of adulthood The bad news is that when a woman begins to go through menopause her female hormones begin to dwindle and those androgens become even more dominant Here comes the acne yet again Try washing your face twice a day with a gentle soap There is no need to wash your face more often unless you are sweating profusely or have a very dirty job Salicylic acid found in a number of acne products works to dissolve the sebaceous oils helping to remove any skin debris that is clogging your pores But be sure to rinse it off thoroughly Also find a very mild benzoyl peroxide cream something that is 25 or less When applied directly to the skin at night it can help unclog you pores as you sleep Try this every other night at first Skin tags are common acquired benign skin growths that look like a small piece of soft hanging skin Skin tags are harmless growths Some individuals may be more prone to tags  between 50100 tags Males and females are equally prone to developing skin tags Obesity and being moderately overweight even temporary increases dramatically increase the chances of having skin tags Normalweight individuals with larger breasts are also more prone to skin tags under their breasts Some small tags spontaneously rub or fall off painlessly and the person may not even know they had a skin tag Most tags do not fall off on their own and stay around once formed The medical name for a skin tag is acrochordon or fibroepithelial polyp Skin tags can occur almost anywhere on the body where there is skin However the top two favorite areas for skin tags are the neck and armpits Other areas include the eyelids upper chest particularly under the female breasts buttock folds and groin folds Tags are typically thought to occur in highfriction locations where skin rubs against skin or clothing most often In general there is no limit to the number of skin tags that can be removed at one office visit as long as your overall health permits the inoffice procedure Hyperpigmentation or dark spots will respond to a combination of chemical peels that contain salicylic acid alphahydroxy acids and skinbrightening agents such as hydroquinone licorice extract or bearberry Your physician will be able to implement a skin care regimen once any underlying medical causes are excluded You may be suffering from a combination of acne and seborrheic dermatitis SD Typically SD sufferers will have flaky skin around the nose and hairline in combination with dry patches There is usually an underlying fungal component with SD that can be treated with an antifungal cream andor shampoo Flareups can be controlled with overthecounter corticosteroids Once this component is under control your acne will be easier to treat Your acne prevention regimen should include an antimicrobial facial wash that contains benzoyl peroxide acid or alphahydroxy acid a mild exfoliating agent and salicylic acid to help clear your clogged pores A change in your skin type may be caused by your skin care regimen Make sure that you are not using products that are overdrying your skin because that will lead to increased oil gland production You should exclude any underlying skin conditions such as eczema psoriasis or seborrhea that may alter your skins oil production You may also have combination skin elements of dry and oily skin Because the nose chin center of the forehead and the cheeks all have more oil glands than any other part of the face it is not surprising that those areas tend to be oilier and may break out more frequently than other areas At the same time the areas that lack oil glands can become dry and flaky Problems occur when you attempt to treat combination skin as one specific skin type Many ingredients that are appropriate for the Tzone the area along the center of the forehead and down the nose where most of the active oil glands on the face are located wont help the drier parts of cheeks eyes or jaws  and vice versa More often than not separate products are required to deal with the different skin types on your face because different skin types even on the same face must be treated differently to truly feel and look better Once you accept this fact and adjust your routine combination skin can be brought into balance at least to the extent that using the right products allows If anything using overly abrasive or irritating skincare products on oilier areas will only worsen combination skins dual nature by making dry areas drier and creating a rough reddened appearance over oily areas Plus treating skin harshly does not correct or improve oiliness in any way because combination skin should be viewed and treated as separate skin types Most body odor is caused by an accumulation of bacteria on the surface of the skin In general this problem can usually be improved with the use of natural cleansers while bathing There are also certain medical conditions  diabetes liver disease and infections for instance  that may contribute to body odor A balanced diet is critical to your wellbeing Imbalances in your nutritional intake may lead to an accumulation of unfriendly bacteria within your digestive system Loose skin around the knees may be part of the natural aging process Extreme weight loss may lead to excess skin These issues may be addressed by a plastic surgeon Excess sun exposure is the No 1 cause of premature aging and wrinkling of the skin If you suffer from chronic swelling around your knees compression garments and support hose may be beneficial Dry skin can be attributed to a variety of skin disorders such as eczema rosacea or psoriasis Medical problems such as thyroid disease kidney disease liver disease and certain connective tissue diseases may also contribute to dry skin Your first approach is to exclude any potential medical causes with your physician If your dry skin is not related to an underlying medical cause then your skin regimen needs to include moisturizers that contain healthrebuilding compounds such as vitamin A C E peptides or hyaluronic acid The term liver spots is somewhat of a misnomer Liver spots are typically not related to any diseases of the liver Most of these changes are due to age sun damage or solar lentigo Your first approach is to exclude any potential skin cancers Once this is accomplished a combination of glycolic peels and skin brightening agents will improve your skin Once you have excluded medical causes there are multiple options to regain your even skin tone A combination of glycolic AHA and retinoidbased products along with a traditional topical skin care regimen for skin brightening will work Hydroquinonebased products work well However there are other alternatives such as bearberry extract kojic acid licorice extract and niacin These compounds will work toward brightening your skin and correcting your skin tone The key is to work with a physician that is very familiar with your skin type and color because incorrect use of these agents can lead to further hypo or hyperpigmentation Natural alternatives such as bearberry extract kojic acid licorice extract and niacin work toward brightening your skin and correcting your skin tone However your first approach should be to avoid exposure to UV rays You should wear a sunscreen containing titanium dioxide with an SPF of at least 40 if you are prone to hyperpigmentation Adult acne and whiteheads are very common It could be caused by anything including a hormonal imbalance makeup a new moisturizer or the sunscreen youre using Try backing off of any new additions to your skin program and trying oil free makeup and skin care It is difficult to assess what is causing your skin irritation Have you been out in the sun without sunscreen Some antiaging products make your skin more susceptible to the sun You may now require more sunscreen or may have used another substance on

adequate rest will improve your circulation and lessen the appearance of dark circles In addition look for topical agents that contain natural brighteners such as bearberry niacin or licorice extract Topical caffeine and green tea also help constrict leaky vessels which helps minimize the appearance of dark circles Your first approach is to consult with your physician in order to exclude any underlying medical causes for the darkening Next work with a dermatologist that knows how to care for people with your skin type and color Your dermatologist should implement a program that combines topical exfoliating treatments to facilitate greater preparation followed by skinbrightening agents and an effective sun block Aging spots or solar lentigos primarily result from sun damage Age spots have also been mislabeled as liver spots They do not have any correlation with liver disease The majority of age spots are benign noncancerous If you notice any changes in the border color or diameter of any lesions on your skin you should be evaluated by your dermatologist Unfortunately almost a third of all diabetics may be more prone to certain types of fungal infections candidiasis or oral thrush Many diabetics are also at a greater risk for secondary bacterial infections such as folliculitis infection of the hair follicles carbuncles deep soft tissue infections and paronychia infections around the nail bed Many of these infections may present initially as a rash Therefore any suspected rash on a diabetic should be evaluated by your physician Certain products may contain preservatives or fragrances that can cause hypersensitivity or an allergic reaction on your skin Also if you are using products that contain tretinoin AHA or salicylic acids your skin may become more sensitive when exposed to direct sunlight Therefore it is important to incorporate a sun block within your skin care regimen You may be suffering from a secondary fungal infection This can usually be treated with topical antifungal cream along with a topical hydrocortisone for the inflammatory component Follow a skin regimen that includes exfoliation AHA salicylic acid and papaya enzymes Hydrate your skin with natural oils that are noncomedogenic nonporeclogging such as almond oil or avocado oil Rejuvenate your skin with natural skin peptides collagen builders and tretinoin The two most important actions are to avoid direct sunlight use a sunblock and steer clear of smoking Next follow a skin regimen that includes exfoliation AHA salycilic acid and papaya enzymes Hydrate with natural

turnover and collagen building Vitiligo can be treated with a variety of approaches including topical steroids UV light therapy photochemotherapy for persons with greater than 20 of their body surface

procedure still in the experimental phase Finally simple noninvasive therapies include the use of cosmetics selftanning lotions and sunscreens The acidic component in lemons does contain some natural lightening properties In general it is safe to use Avoid using lemons on any area that has recently been waxed or shaved Lemons may cause irritation in the perianal regions Unfortunately trying to lighten your skin with lemons will take a long time Consider using hydroquinine kojic acid alphahydroxy acids or bearberry as more effective lightening agents Tretinoin contains compounds that have been shown to increase cell turnover and collagen formation Unfortunately with severe weight loss there can be a loss of elasticity in your skin Therefore you may want to discuss these problematic areas with your dermatologist or a plastic surgeon There are several pigmented skin problems caused by hormones Age spots are very common And youre correct they are caused by sun exposure There are several agents that lighten them including licorice extract niacin hydroquinone and others Its very important during and after the use of a brightening agent to apply sunblock or the spots will return Sunblock is an effective first step for controlling dark patches Certain lasers will reduce pigmentation However for darker skin patients lasers should be only be used by professionals that are familiar with your skin type Inadvertent use may result in increased pigmentation The mask of pregnancy or melasma can be very difficult to treat Melasma is treated with a combination of chemical peels and topical skin lightening agents along with sunblocking compounds Unfortunately you may need to visit your dermatologist to receive prescriptionstrength compounds if your melasma is not responding to overthecounter treatments Your first step is to evaluate your current skincare regimen Harsh soaps detergents or products with high alcohol content will irritate the skin which may lead to further oil production You should use gentle cleansers and exfoliate weekly with compounds that contain salicylic acid and are noncomedogenic Along with your exfoliating regimen your physician can recommend skinbrightening compounds that will work in conjunction with salicylic acid which will even out your skin tone A purple color under your eyes may be attributed to the tiny blood vessels within your lower eyelid The skin in this area is quite thin and stretched over the bony prominence which will make these blood vessels more noticeable The key to having healthy glowing skin is to utilize sunblock followed by a skincare regimen that includes exfoliation hydration and nutrition Within your diet include vitamins that are good for your skin such as folic acid magnesium and omega3 fatty acids If you moisturize and hydrate your skin and body you will be much less likely to develop dry skin Your dermatologist should evaluate skin changes or abnormal spots A lesion that feels hard may be scar tissue However you should be evaluated for any underlying skin cancer When evaluating your skin look for changes in the area border or color of the skin These are the ABCs of skin cancer detection Amyloidosis may take several forms In most cases amyloidosis is a systemic disease meaning that it affects the entire body Treatment for this form will require a specialized regimen depending on the organ affected Amyloidosis develops when amyloid protein inexplicably builds up in the organs or tissue including the heart liver kidneys spleen gastrointestinal tract and nervous system Cutaneous lichen amyloidosis confined to the skin can be treated with a variety of approaches including cryotherapy intralesional steroid injections surgical excision or phototherapy PUVA Unfortunately there is no specific treatment for systemic or cutaneus manifestations of amyloidosis Therefore therapy is usually directed at the target organ to provide symptomatic relief Skin preparation is a very important part of many cosmetic procedures Especially in darker skinned patients who may run the risk for postinflammatory hyperpigmentation darkening of the skin Your physician may prescribe a combination of topical exfoliating agents along with skin brighteners in order to prepare your skin prior to your cosmetic procedure At age 16 I would avoid many of the harsh chemicals that are available It may be wise to have an evaluation by your doctor to determine if there are any underlying medical issues Next implement simple measures such as getting at least 810 hours of sleep every night Dont leave the weekends to catchup on your rest Apply cool a compress with green tea bags around your eyes This will help with puffiness Your antiaging skin care regimen should start in your 20s Begin with a sunblock followed by a gentle exfoliater and tretinoinbased creams to help rebuild collagen This combination will work toward maintaining a rejuvenated appearance You should use moisturizers that are noncomedogenic nonporeclogging For individuals with oily skin the use of products that clog pores may lead to increased oil production Oily skin needs special cleansing with plenty of warm water and soap to prevent the pores from being clogged Avoid harsh products that strip your skin of oil and encourage flakiness They can cause a reaction known as reactive seborrhea where the oil glands work overtime to compensate for the loss of natural oils Avoid skincare products that leave your skin feeling taut and dehydrated They cause the upper layers of the skin to shrink This restricts oil flow through the pores leading to blockages and breakouts A blood blister that results from a pinch is an accumulation of blood as a result of trauma to the skin It is best NOT to pop a blood blister as this can lead to infection and possibly even delay the natural healing process of your body Covering the blood blister with a soft dressing to keep it protected can be helpful as it resolves on its own If the person who has the blood blister has any underlying health conditions especially diabetes it would be appropriate to seek medical care If the blood blister pops on its own do not peel off the remaining skin Rather leave it in place treat the area with an antiseptic ointment and cover with a clean dressing Allow it to heal in its own time If the injury is very recent ice can help to reduce the pain that the trauma initially induced At this point you will need professional treatments like chemical peels or microdermabrasion to removed this scarring caused by acne As an example a series of microdermabrasion treatments will help to remove dead skin that has hyperpigmentation and stimulate new cell growth to even out the tone of your complexion Thinning of the skin on your forearms can be attributed to a variety of reasons this includes a genetic predisposition weight loss  and certain medications such as steroids catabolic can lead to thinning of the skin Also as we age the rate of collagen formation under our skin will decrease This may also be a contributing factor to thin skin Almost any product will improve the condition of your skin With the exception of acne most bad skin conditions are the result of neglect Too much sun wind water without doing any repair will leave skin rough dry dull red irritated and feeling tight Simply paying attention to what your skin needs will result in a clear improvement Rather than paying attention to the ads on television and in magazines try products for yourself Not every product works the same way on every person so take advantage of those free samples When you find one that feels really good stick with it and use it as directed Some of these product lines suggest that you use a cleanser toner eye cream daytime face cream and nighttime face cream If you find a product that works well with your skin the companion products will likely work well for you too because they are made from similar base products If you need eye cream use it If youre pretty young you can get away without it Remember anything that you use on a daily basis is going to do more good for you than something that you will resist using I have the same problem Itching in the same location on my back below my right shoulder blade for almost 2 years now My dermatologist said it was a form of arthritis When I

and perfume Best way to find out if youre sensitive to ingredients in a product Dab the product on the skin of your forearm and leave it for 24 hours If theres no reaction theres no problem But if redness itching or blistering occur this products not for you Most blisters caused by friction or minor burns do not require a doctors care New skin will form underneath the affected area and the fluid is simply absorbed Do not puncture a blister unless it is large painful or likely to be further irritated The fluidfilled blister keeps the underlying skin clean which prevents infection and promotes healing If you have to pop a blister Use a sterilized needle or razor blade to sterilize it put the point or edge in a flame until it is red hot or rinse it in alcohol Wash the area thoroughly then make a small hole and gently squeeze out the clear fluid If the fluid is white or yellow the blister may be infected and needs medical attention Do not remove the skin over a broken

moisturizer on a daily basis It is particularly important to do so immediately after you shower bathe or wash your hands while your skin is still damp Take shorter showers Bathing or showering too often strips the natural oils from your skin causing it to become dry Hot water also robs the skin of moisture Skip the scented soap Instead choose a mild cleanser Unscented bath soaps or those labeled for sensitive skin are the best choices for lathering up in the bath or shower if you are prone to dry skin Fragrant soaps and body washes can also lead to dry skin and itchiness The same rule goes for laundry detergent Avoid perfumed or scented detergents and fabric softeners Detergent names or labels often contain the word free to indicate they do not contain perfumes or dyes Do not use cleansing toners colognes body mists and splashes aftershaves or similar products that contain alcohol Alcohol dries out the skin Drink plenty of water and fluids This helps keep your skin moist from the inside out Avoid coarse scratchy or rough fabrics such as wool which can make skin feel itchy Choose softer fabrics like 100 cotton or silk Keep this in mind when choosing clothing and bedding Dry air and lowhumidity climates can pull water from your skin Running a humidifier in your home particularly when you have the heat on can restore moisture to the air Aim for a humidity level of about

Ive found for it is called Boudreauxs Butt Paste its a diaper rash cream that can be found in most grocery stores or walmarts You just spread it on pretty thickly and wait over night and the pain and redness will have decreased and itll be on its way to healing I repeat usage as needed Boudreauxs Butt Paste is completely harmless so it can be used frequently It has a pretty sweet scent but its not unbearable and it certainly beats vinegar Tenderness and soreness can be an indication of any number of dermatological complications Many of us suffer from dry or itchy skin given the time of year If the skin cracks it can bleed or become very painful even though there may be little thats obviously wrong with it However your symptoms sound pretty far beyond what dry skin can feel like I would buy a real aloe vera plant Cut off a leaf slicing open one side and pealing it open to expose the center scrape the jelly off apply to wound and only if you have to cover it like you would any other wound

wound heal quickly It is your responsibility to take good care of your skin You have to keep it clean every time so I dont see a good point on why you should write on your skin Writing on your skin

problem Automatically treating for a yeast infection can increase discomfort and hinder proper treatment options of some other infections Its best to have a swab test done to find out EXACTLY what

effect from puberty for me but not every girl goes through the same puberty experiences The lump under the nipple is definitely normal its what will grow to be the fat in every breast As she goes through puberty that lump will grow and will eventually become the breast Of course She might be beginning puberty early according to the average consensus but lumps under the nipples and tenderness

foreskin sometimes retracts during intercourse and sometime it does not The more enlarged with blood my penis is the less the skin retracts I used to always retract it when first married but then found that the foreskin can act as a way of aiding penetration if penetration is started when while the foreskin is on the head of the penis Most uncircumcised guys I have talked to say that their penis is sensitive enough so that if the foreskin rolls back and exposes the penile head during intercourse they are very aware of it Most like that a few dont About half of the boys in the town where I grew up were uncut about half cut because there were two doctors delivering babiesone tried to talk all parents into leaving their boys intact the other tried to talk all parents into having their boys uncircumcised In my opinion the majority of uncircumcised males can tell if their foreskin is retracted during intercourse based on my conversations with other uncircumcised males As far as penetration you can get a good idea of how much penetration there is by measuring on top the length of your penis then during intercourse put a hand down there during fullest penetration you can manage and see WHERE on your penis a finger hits How much penis is still outside the vagina Then you will have a pretty good answer as to how much penetration there is Sometimes hitting the outer skin is half the battle I used to have really bad acne when I was younger and they prescribed me a lot of creams that never worked I heavily researched online and noticed how a diet plays a significant role in oily skin that results in breakouts I decided to do a research study of my own and it involved a two week diet of using olive oil grease and other fatty foods Then the next two weeks I ate more vegetables especially a  c and also took 50 mg of zinc and cut the saturated fats within 40g and consumed 0 trans fats The first two weeks I experienced break outs that only seemed to keep getting worse and worse Then the after the first week of eating healthier I noticed a halt and no new acne had sprung up or anything and most of my breakouts began to go away At the end of the second week my skin had just about cleared up which was expected due to the vitamin a c and zinc helping reduce oily skin In reality dermatology is a scam when many home remedies can be found in your home hope this helps I do not want to have them Yes it can be caused by the cold weather we might always feel warm but is the cold that is inside the body that is causing this pain and swell No you cannot

popping them for fun but you should go to an instacare and have it excised and maybe get antibiotics Ive never heard of this triangle of death before symptoms of this type of infection would be like any other I assume redness irritation inflammation pain to the touch try some neosporin to excel healing Judging from your screen name as a diabetic you want to keep your hands clean cause you will not heal as quickly This is why your DRY hands wont heal as quickly I do not see your hands so I can not rule out a rash but I feel you may be confusing a rash with just general dryness Try some

for dry skin go take a gander and see which bottle matches your hands The winter months make dry hands worse so keep inside and keep warm none no none of these u ask Google Perianal Peritoneal and

want to soak in water full of Table Saltwill burn but will help close it ANd go to drug store and as for Barrier Cream will most likely be in diaper rash cream Call or go to your dentist office If it

was told it should go away in 13 years I also use a prescribed steroid based cream to control the spread  redness I am told it is not harmful more annoying andembarrassing for me stress I AM NOT A DOCTOR but I can tell you that you should see one infections need to be cleaned out and the puss needs to be drained for now Id say to give it a hydrogen poeroxide soak and to put some antibiotic ointment on it then wrap it up in a band aid or gauze until you can get to a doctor or clinic I know you wanted to do this all at home but it might be better to see a doctor now After all I assume you

my mother would always bleach my shower after every one I took Try hydrocortisone and good luck After a few months your body will become use to the med Then if the dosage goes up the painful burning

complications from the IUD Please do not wait to see your doctor If you cannot get into the one that gave you the IU then see your primary care physician If the pain becomes unbearable then go to your local ER There are a lot of things that can cause the penis to appear dry and flaky Yeast infections skin allergies drying soaps or even dry masturbation or sex can cause this If there is any reason

callus That is the reason only the skin around the wart started to tear the skin that makes up the body of the wart is far to thick Go see your Dr He will scrape off the thick layer of skin painless just like shaving a callus he will scrape it off until the roots are exposed as they are visible When the roots are exposed they must be destroyed usually burned You will be numbed for this part Its a very quick procedure and the most reliable way to ensure proper and complete removal and avoidance of a recurrence my advise would be go to the er if it doesnt get better because these can be signs of a stroke or something else I had same problem and found out it was my thyroid I gained 56 lbs in 4 weeks have some blood drawn but tell ur doctor to test ur thyroid There are 75 of americans who have thyroid disease and it goes untested try that and congrats on the new baby God Bless and hope this help u out to ease ur mind some Get blood work as soon as possible it sounds like Impetigo I had similar all of a sudden pop up a couple of months back and being in medical field with several Medical degrees it was first to come to mind and I went to my doctor and he prescribed a ointment that was awesome and it went away in 2 days had it for a week before I went to my doctor cause pain was getting so impossible to deal with Best of Luck and hope this helps you out Its also important to remember that itching is part of a tattoos healing process Intense itching like want to scratch your arm off itching When the old skin dies and flakes off the new skin growth itches like crazy for a few days before settling down Cool showers and your tattoo aftercare ointment gently massaged into the tattoo will help but all in all the itching will pass after the tattoo is healed Allergic reaction to the ink will look more like red speckles or spots all around your tattoo unusual oozing puss or smelly discharge You will know within hours of receiving your tattoo if you are allergic to the ink Most tattoo pigments are completely organic and allergic reactions are rare  and most often to red ink Never put a first aid product or antiitch lotion onto an unhealed tattoo you will first off be in a ton of pain and subsequently ruin your tattoo  A Tattoo Artist I have what sounds like the exact same thing I ended up going to one of the free clinics sponsored by the cancer center for breast cancer awareness and got it looked at even an ultrasound done on it They said that it is not a real concern unless it were a hard lump and ultrasound confirmed it was just a random buildup of fat and tissue I have had mine for about 4years now still there and still the same size If it were to change in size or get hard then I would definitely get it looked at again no The best thing to do is just keep it clean  if you want to cover it to protect it from being hit rubbed or dirt then use gauze  change it often to keep it from sticking Let me say again not a node its doesnt swell or become soar if i get sick it has nothing to do with being sick its always there the same size just like the first bump i describes my final bump i just noticed the other day Its kind of under my tounge another word i cant spell or on the floor of my mouth but just where my hard gum line meets the soft floor of my mouthIt stick out a little bit and is annoying I looked online for a long time in search of my most recent bump but most of what i found there were multiple conjoining bumps Either way Im freaked out as I see some pretty crazy stuff online yet none of it completely descibes me is my RT food color is normal has a burning or bruised but have not hit it I get this pretty frequent what to use to stop dog itching and chewing his body if you are sexually aroused theres a valve that shuts off urine flow and makes it impossible to urinate during sex if you are not aroused then you need to see a urologist about your possible enlarged prostate mine has been enlarged since my twenties when you first have the urge to urinate dont wait the longer you hold it the more it hurts blood pressure meds help as does flomax Maybe you are allergic to the massage oilcream that are causing the welts and irritations As far as feeling fatigue and joint pain thats what deep tissue massage does but then you should feel better within the next two days If its really severe fatigue andor pain then the therapist is going at it too harddeep for your condition It could be a skin tag Best thing is to go and see a doctor and he will let you know and if you want to get rid of it they will let you know what you need to do Sounds like an in grown hair You are more likely to get ingrown hairs if you shave in this area If it doesnt go away on its on in a short time or if more appear I would get to you doctor just to be sure if I were to be expering a blood clot in my knee to my thigh would the redness and painful away when Im sittingthank you could be allergic reaction to a med Im not sure if this is any help but have you been consistently putting something on it like facial wash that might irritate it Ive done that before and just had to make sure that I didnt continue to do that and it got better I hope that I am wrong but I had the same type of thing however mine had other symptoms such as a reoccurring UTI once or twice a year for for over 10 years Mine was attributed to a calcium build up on the walls of the urethra and other veins in the area due to a bladder diverticulum I was a Milk Junkie 12 gallon a day I had over 3000 calcium stones in a sack about 34 the size of my bladder I had this in my younger years like late 20s early 30s my doctor said it was simply acidic sweat and to put baby powder on it for 3 to 5 days IT WORKED I also had the same thing between my legs and oddly enough the seam or crack in the skin  that connects the ear to the head My daughter caught it from her friend 5 yrs ago and it was from putting her slippers on I never caught it tho when I rubbed the ointment on her back where it wasI immediately washed my hands tho too I guess different people affected differently by things Hemorrhoid Due to heavy work many of them are

similar person had the same thing and their Dr said that it was a new virus strain Depending on size of dog baby aspirin for pain and childrens benadryl in dose recommended for weight What are you

something out for you If not I am available to go to bat for you With the bipolar meds that I take daily I am not afraid of anything drinking plenty of water is an awesome flusher to the system i know

left elbow and itchy spots on the nape of my neck and palms of both hands Then it started on my forehead After six years of accumulating symptoms and wondering what was happening to me since I never needed to see a doctor for 40 years the answer came in self diagnosis first Turns out I have celiac disease and all the other symptoms were due to a weakened immune system because of the disease Since I am on the road to recovery only beginning I have seen improvements To help with the dry patches I keep the area moisturized but I have also cut down on caffeine and increased my water intake I also drink hot lemon water every morning to aid the kidneys Basically improve your immune system through healthy eating and maybe that will help It is for me Good Luck Possible causes are sebactus cysts or clogged pores one way would be find a deep cleaning system then see if you can use a aloe mask three day a week Hi thanks for inquiring Mostly outer arms and legs Sperm can swim Male sperm are fast and furious while Female sperm are slower but live longer and stick around longer If your cervical mucus is thin and stretchy and if you arent using excessive lubricants I am positive that not penetrating deeply is no problem at all In fact some experts associate less deep ejaculations with female children as the male sperm die before reaching their destination You might have damaged your bursa sac A urologist would be the one to see Its not normal and if its causing you pain you need to make it clear to the urologist that you dont want to live with it By the way are you sure youre giving it time enough to fully heal before engaging in masturbation or sexual activity which tears it open again I remember when I was a teenager I ripped the frenulum from too vigorous masturbation and it stayed torn and painful for weeks because I couldnt stop touching myself It finally did heal but it forced me to change how I masturbated light touch rather than jerking off so as to not irritate it further Not quite sure myself Not an expert but that sounds pretty serious i would see your Doc you need to get to bed earlier  try working out in the am and then maybe your body will be tired at night "}
